Introduction The human gut microbiota is considered currently as one of the most active research fields in microbiology 1 . In fact, this microflora harbours a huge biodiversity of bacteria of which a large part is still unknow 2 . Researchers used a variety of strategies to speed up and simplify the description of new bacterial species by optimizing their in vitro growth conditions 3 , 4 , 5 . Culturomics is one among these strategies, which relies on a diversification of culture conditions that allowed the identification of several new bacterial species isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract 3 , 4 , 5 . Since 2012, it allowed the isolation of over 1000 different human-associated bacterial species, including several hundreds of new species 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . This method highlighted the need to adopt taxonomic approaches to clinical microbiology by including the use of modern and reproducible tools, such as high throughput genomic and proteomic analyses. In November 30, 2015, two putative new bacterial species, Culturomica massiliensis gen. nov., sp. nov., and Emergencia timonensis gen. nov., sp. nov. , were isolated from patient’s stools, and partially described 7 , 8 . The genomic sequencing of new described bacterial species constitutes currently a necessary step for performing their comparative taxogenomic descriptions with their closest related known species. In fact, several recent publications have used genomic descriptions to characterize the new species by comparison to their closest relatives strains 9 , 10 , 11 . The aim of our current study was to complete the phenotypic, taxonomic and genomic characterization proposal of new genera and new species of Culturomica massiliensis gen. nov., sp. nov. , strain Marseille-P2698 T , and Emergencia timonensis gen. nov., sp. nov. , strain Marseille-P2260 T and formally expose the creation of both species. Materials and methods Sample collection and ethics approval In November 30, 2015, stool samples were collected from hospitalized patients in the Timone Hospital (Marseille, France) as a part of a study of human microbiota diversity. Patients provided signed informed consent 7 , 8 . The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the institut de recherche fédératif 48, under agreement number 09-022. In addition, all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Each sample was then cultured according to the culturomics method previously established in our laboratory 3 , 5 . Various types of bacterial colonies were isolated on 5% of sheep blood-enriched Columbia agar (bioMérieux®, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Bacterial colonies were then screened for identification by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) instrument (Bruker Daltonics®, Bremen, Germany) as previously reported 12 . Both two strains studied herein had a MALDI-TOF score lower than 2.0, which did not allow their correct identification. Their spectra were then added to the local MALDI-TOF MS database ( https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/urms-data-base ). 16S rRNA gene sequencing and identification The 16S rRNA sequences from both strains were directly extracted from their whole genomes sequences and then, compared by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool nucleotide (BLASTn) to the non-redundant (nr) databases 13 . The obtained sequence similarity percentages allowed identification of the closest species to each strain, and to predict if it was new species (< 98.65% of similarity). Then, the phylogenetic tree was constructed based on these 16S rRNA gene sequences in comparison to the closest related species of each studied strain. Designated species sequences were downloaded from nr 14 , and aligned with ClustalW. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA 11 version 11.0.10 with the maximum likelihood method and 1000 bootstrap replications 15 . Phenotypic and biochemical characterizations Optimal culture conditions were determined by testing various incubation temperatures (25, 28, 37, 42, and 50 °C), atmospheres (aerobic, anaerobic and microaerophilic), NaCl concentrations (5, 5.5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20% of NaCl) and pH levels (5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5). The morphology and motility were observed using a new-generation scanning electron microscope (Hitachi High-71 Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Furthermore, three semi-quantitative standardized micro-methods of Analytical Profile Index (API®, bioMérieux®) tests: API® 20A, API® 50 CH, and API® ZYM were used, according to the manufacturer’s instructions 16 , in order to study carbohydrate metabolism and enzymatic activities. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis was explored by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry, as previously reported 17 , 18 . FAMEs were separated using an Elite 5-MS column and monitored by mass spectrometry (Clarus 500—SQ 8 S, Perkin Elmer®, Courtaboeuf, France). Obtained spectra were compared with those contained in the repertory databases using MS Search 2.0 operated with the Standard Reference Database 1A (National Institute of Standards and Technology-NIST, Gaithersburg, USA), and FAMEs mass spectral database (Wiley, Chichester, UK). Whole genomic sequencing and bioinformatic analyses First, bacterial DNA was extracted using the EZ1 DNeasy Blood Tissue Kit (Qiagen® GmbH, Hilden, Germany) in line with the manufacturer’s protocol 19 . Whole-genome sequencing was performed using an Illumina® MiSeq sequencer (Illumina®, San Diego, CA, USA) 20 . Then, sequenced genomes were assembled using SPAdes 3.5.0 software 21 , which reduces short indels and the huge number of mismatches. Raw reads in contigs less than 700-bp-long were removed. Finally, the quality of the sequenced genome was checked using BLAST against the nr/nt database. This method allowed us to better explore the relationship between a submitted assembly of our new species to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), i.e., DDBJ, ENA, or GenBank, and the assembly represented in the NCBI reference sequence (RefSeq) project. The global statistics section reported general statistics information including Gaps between scaffolds, number of scaffolds, number of contigs, total sequence length, and total ungapped length. Furthermore, taxonomic data were checked according to the best-matching-type strain with the declared new species repertory in NCBI 22 . During annotation, genomic parameters were evaluated including transfer-messenger RNAs (tmRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) using ARAGORN version 1.2 and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) using Barrnap version 0.9 23 , 24 . Generated file (. faa ) was used for BLAST-P analyses against the Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COGs) database, and used for CRISPR-Cas identification 25 . Resistance genes were screened using ResFinder 26 . Other bioinformatic tools were also used such as AntiSMASH to search polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) 27 . Circular maps of the two genomes were generated using CGView (Circular Genome Viewer) software. This Java application converts XML or tab-delimited input into a Vector Graphics format 28 . Besides, phylogenetic trees of interest were generated with the FastME 2.1.6.1 software to highlight the position of each new bacterial strain among its closest relatives 29 . Digital DNA-DNA Hybridization (dDDH) values were calculated to check the difference between the genomes using the following website ( https://ggdc.dsmz.de ). Critical limit was set at 70% below which a prokaryotic species may be considered as new 30 . Orthologous average nucleotide identity (OrthoANI) version 0.93.1 was also used to calculate genomic similarities between studied species and their related taxa. Ethics approval The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Institut de Recherche Fédératif 48 under Authorization number 09-022 with the consent of the patients. Results Strain identification and phylogenetic analyses The species names Culturomica massiliensis gen. nov., sp. nov., and Emergencia timonensis gen. nov., sp. nov., had been previously proposed for the new species mainly as representative strains Marseille-P2698 T and Marseille-P2260 T , respectively 7 , 8 . As these previous descriptions were not exhaustive, we revisited the work by including phylogenetic, morphological, and genomic data. Strain Marseille-P2698 T had a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and a query coverage of 91.5% and 99% respectively with Odoribacter laneus strain YIT 12061 T (Fig. 1 ). Strain Marseille-P2260 T exhibited 16S rRNA gene similarity and a query coverage of 92.72%, and 100% respectively, with Eubacterium sulci strain ATCC 35585 T (Fig. 1 ). Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree with the position of new species (strains Marseille-P2698 T and Marseille-P2260 T ) among closely related species. The following phylogenetic tree was performed from the comparison of 16S rRNA sequences. The accession numbers of 16S rRNA gene are mentioned in parentheses. Bootstrap appears at the nodes. MUSCLE software was used to align sequences. The tree was designed with the MEGA-X software. The used methodology is the Maximum Likelihood method and Kimura 2-parameter model.
