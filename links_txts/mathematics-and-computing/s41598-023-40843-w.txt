Results and discussion The system of dimensionless differential equations are cracked by numerical approach and presented the governing factors are presented through graphs and tabular form. Physical parameter ranges are as \(0<\varpi <5\) , \(0<{\beta }_{1}<2\) , \(0< {\gamma }_{0}<2\) , \(0<{\alpha }_{0}<3\) , \(0<{\alpha }_{1}<3\) , \(1<{\lambda }_{0}<100\) , \(0<Ec<2\) , \(0<\epsilon <2\) , \(1<Pr<100\) , \(0<{Q}_{1}<2\) and \(0<Rd<3\) . These range are taken from the literature which applied in the problem. The impression of involving physical factors namely: \({\beta }_{1}\) (Maxwell fluid factor), \({\gamma }_{0}\) (Magnetic field), \({\alpha }_{0}\) (Sutterby fluid factor), \({\alpha }_{1}\) (Darcy resistant), \({\lambda }_{0}\) (Magnetic Prandtl number), \(Ec\) (Eckert number), \(\epsilon\) (Variable thermal conductivity), \(Pr\) (Prandtl number), \({Q}_{1}\) (Heat generation) and \(Rd\) (radiation factor) on the temperature, induced magnetic and velocity function which publicised through Figs. 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 .

Full size image Figure 12 Variation of \(Rd\) and \(\theta (\eta )\) . Full size image Figure 2 publicized the variation of \({\alpha }_{1}\) ((Darcy's resistance) on the velocity. The velocity revealed growing up when the values of \({\alpha }_{1}\) (Darcy resistant) boosted up. It relates the frictional pressure drop in porous media to the increase in flow velocity in the media. The variation of \({\alpha }_{0}\) (Sutterby fluid factor) and velocity is publicized in Fig. 3 . The velocity revealed deteriorating when the values of \({\alpha }_{0}\) (Sutterby fluid factor) boosted up. Because of the increment in the Sutterby fluid parameter which increment in fluid viscosity ultimately fluid velocity declined because the viscosity of fluid enlarges as well as fluid velocity declined at the surface. Figure 4 exposed the impact of \({\gamma }_{0}\) (magnetic field factor) on velocity. The velocity is publicized growing up due to larger values in \({\gamma }_{0}\) (magnetic field factor). The velocity profile is boosted by thicker momentum boundary layers, which are caused by higher values of the \({\gamma }_{0}\) . Magnetic field is implemented vertically on the fluid flow because Lorentz force is implemented to become a laminar flow. So, the fluid flow become higher velocity due to enlarging values of \({\gamma }_{0}\) (magnetic field factor). Figure 5 exposed the impact of \({\beta }_{1}\) (Maxwell fluid factor) on velocity. The velocity publicized growing up due to larger values in \({\beta }_{1}\) (Maxwell fluid factor). This behaviour is caused by the Maxwell parameter raising the fluid viscosity, which lowers the yield stress, as its values are increased. Variation of \({\gamma }_{0}\) (magnetic field factor) and induced magnetic function publicized in Fig. 6 . It is noted that induced magnetic curves exposed growing up due to advancing values of \({\gamma }_{0}\) (Magnetic field factor). As a result of the magnetic field being applied in the flow norm's direction. The resistive force produced by this magnetic field causes the fluid's velocity to grow up. Variation of \({\lambda }_{0}\) (Magnetic Prandtl number) and induced magnetic function publicized in Fig. 7 . It is noted that induced magnetic curves revealed deteriorating due to higher values of \({\lambda }_{0}\) (Magnetic Prandtl number). The magnetic Prandtl number is the ratio of viscosity to magnetic diffusion. If the viscosity of fluid enhanced which declined the curves of magnetic profile due to enlarging values of magnetic Prandtl number. The physical factor of \(Ec\) (Eckert number) and temperature exposed variation in Fig. 8 . The temperature curves publicized boosting up due to higher values of \(Ec\) . The Eckert number enlarged which boosted the viscous heating which improved the temperature of liquid. The physical factor of \(\epsilon\) and temperature revealed variation in Fig. 9 . The temperature curves publicized boosting up due to higher values of \(\epsilon\) . The thermal conductivity of liquid boosted which improved the temperature of liquid. Since both kinetic energy and potential collision energy increase with temperature, fluids become more thermally conductive as a result. The thermal conductivity of fluid increases with temperature. The influence of \(Pr\) (Prandtl number) on the temperature exposed in Fig. 10 . Temperature curves exposed declined by addition of \(Pr\) (Prandtl number) in both cases of stretching cylinder/sheet. Because Prandtl number and thermal conductivity are inversely proportional. As the Prandtl number increased which declined the fluid thermal conductivity ultimately, the temperature of fluid reduced. The influence of \({Q}_{1}\) on the temperature exposed in Fig. 11 . Temperature curves exposed increasing by the addition of \({Q}_{1}\) (Heat generation) in both cases of stretching cylinder/sheet. Because heat generation built up the temperature high, fluid temperature revealed boost up. Temperature and radiation variation are exposed in Fig. 12 . It is realized that temperature curves boost up due to higher values of radiation factor. Because the radiation factor built up the temperature high fluid temperature revealed a boost in both cases of stretching cylinder/sheet. For both heat generation, the temperature field increases for higher values of the radiation parameter. The improvement in temperature distribution is caused by higher values of Rd. Table 1 incorporated the influence of physical factors namely: \(Rd\) (radiation factor), \(Pr\) (Prandtl number), \({Q}_{1}\) (Heat generation), \(Ec\) (Eckert parameter), \(\epsilon\) (small parameter), \({\gamma }_{0}\) (Magnetic field factor), \({\lambda }_{0}\) (Magnetic Prandtl number), \({\alpha }_{0}\) (Sutterby fluid factor), \({\alpha }_{1}\) (Darcy resistant) and \({\beta }_{1}\) (Maxwell fluid factor) on the friction factor and heat transfer factor. Friction feature degenerated while heat transfer factor advanced due to increment of radiation factor in both cases of stretchable sheet/cylinder. Because the radiation factor produced heat increment due to higher values of radiation factor which improved the heat transfer phenomena enhance. Friction feature is fixed while heat transfer factor degenerated due to an increment of Prandtl number in both cases of stretchable sheet/cylinder. Physically, thermal conductivity of liquid degenerated due to enlarging values of \(Pr\) , ultimately heat transfer phenomena revealing decline at surface. Friction feature is enlarged while heat transfer factor advanced up due to an increment of heat generation factor in both cases of stretchable sheet/cylinder. Because the heat generation factor produced heat increment due to higher values of heat generation factor which improved the heat transfer phenomena enhance. The friction feature and heat transfer factor advanced due to the addition of heat Eckert number in both cases of stretchable sheet/ cylinder. Because, Eckert number produced heat increment which developed the heat transfer phenomena augment. Physically, the kinematic energy of fluid particles boosted due to enlarging the values of Eckert number ultimately, heat transfer factor enlarged. Due to random motion of fluid particles for enlarging values of Eckert number ultimately, the friction feature increased. The heat transfer factor heightened while friction feature advanced up due to increment of \(\epsilon\) in both cases of stretchable sheet/cylinder. Temperature depends on the thermal conductivity of the material and has directly proportional relation. As thermal conductivity boosted due to enlarging values of thermal conductivity parameter ultimately, temperature of fluid revealed enhancement. Heat transfer factor and friction at surface factor boosted up for increment of \({\gamma }_{0}\) . The \({\gamma }_{0}\) (Magnetic field factor) is larger which better-quality of heat transfer at surface and also offered the results of friction factor boosting up in both cases of stretching sheet/cylinder. The \({\lambda }_{0}\) (Magnetic Prandtl number) increased which provided better-quality of heat transfer at surface. It also offered the results of friction factor boosting up in case of stretching cylinder but opposite behaviour have been noted for both Heat transfer factor and friction at surface factor degenerated due to larger values of \({\lambda }_{0}\) in case of stretching sheet. Increment of \({\alpha }_{0}\) (Sutterby fluid factor) which improved friction and heat transfer factors for both stretching cylinder/sheet cases. Because, the increment in Sutterby fluid parameter which increment in fluid viscosity ultimately fluid velocity declined because viscosity of fluid enlarges as well as friction boosted up at surface. The \({\alpha }_{1}\) (Darcy resistant) larger which better-quality of heat transfer at surface. It is also offered the results of friction factor deteriorating in case of stretching cylinder but opposite behaviour have been noted for both Heat transfer factor and friction at surface due to larger values of \({\alpha }_{1}\) (Darcy resistant) in case of stretching sheet. It relates the frictional pressure drop in porous media to the increase in flow velocity in the media ultimately, friction dropped at surface of cylinder and opposite behaviour have been noted for both Heat transfer factor and friction at surface due to larger values of \({\alpha }_{1}\) (Darcy resistant) in case of stretching sheet. The \({\beta }_{1}\) (Maxwell fluid factor) enlarged which better-quality of heat transfer at surface and also offered the results of friction factor boosting up in both cases of stretching sheet/cylinder. The friction factor is boosted up due to thickness of momentum improved which this behaviour is caused by the Maxwell parameter raising the fluid viscosity, which lowers the yield stress, as its values are increased. The comparative analysis of the present model is done in Tables 2 , 3 . It is noted that the present work has been found to be good agreement with Rangi and Ahmad 45 , Qasim et al. 47 and Suleman et al. 46 .

The main key finding results are presented below: The velocity profile is boosted by thicker momentum boundary layers, which are caused by higher values of the \({\gamma }_{0}\) . \(-\) The friction factor is boosted due to improving the Maxwell fluid parameter. This behaviour is caused by the Maxwell fluid parameter raising the fluid viscosity, which lowers the yield stress, as its values are increased. Increment of \({\alpha }_{0}\) (Sutterby fluid factor) which improved friction and heat transfer factors for both stretching cylinder/sheet cases. Because, the increment in Sutterby fluid parameter which increment in fluid viscosity ultimately fluid velocity declined because viscosity of fluid enlarges as well as friction boosted up at surface.
