Introduction India's economy is growing rapidly, necessitating increased hydrocarbon transport capacity. An item of machinery called a pipeline is made to move material constantly or irregularly from one place to another. Modern technologies prefer pipelines over other modes of transportation due to financial and safety reasons. Pressure is applied as highly flammable hydrocarbon material is transported across pipelines across the nation, frequently close to dense populations and places with a high environmental consciousness. Allocating a lot of money to preventive measures activities for mitigation and detection will help you analyse the risk presented by international pipelines effectively. To protect individuals, the general public, the environment, and property, more safety must be provided. An effective algorithm is required to simplify the processes and lower the failure rate of gas pipelines 1 . Pipelines pose risks such as jet fire, unconfined vapour cloud explosion, flash fire, delay ignition, pool fire, and toxicity. There are many integrity management tools, like cathodic protection, inline inspection, hydro testing, surveillance, direct assessment and evaluations, pipeline equipment health monitoring, and thickness assessment 2 , 3 . The pipeline threats are categorised as fixed, non-stationary, and stationary. The non-stationary threats are outer erosion, inner erosion, and strain erosion splitting. Pipeline defects can occur during the manufacturing process, as well as during welding or fabrication 4 . Some of the failures that occur as a result of gasket toxicity (joint failure, guide apparatus malfunction, and clinch force out failure) must also be considered when considering the threat to stable equipment. Many other threats should be considered as time-independent threats while analysing the threats in equipment and external factors. As with computer hackers, some third parties may damage pipeline equipment or perform incorrect operations, causing the pipeline to malfunction. Natural disasters 5 like lightning, heavy rains, floods, weather-related events, and earth movements also affect the quality of pipelines. Due to the severity of the composite risk from all threats, pipeline sections may be prioritised for integrity assessment. The overall risk value for a specific pipeline section is determined by the likelihood of failure and its consequences, taking into account all relevant dangers. Risk ranking 6 will be determined for pipeline segments found to be at high risk in order to arrange the integrity evaluation. Prior to the execution of any pipeline framework advancements, an exact cycle will be put in place to make sure that impending changes are evaluated for their potential risk effects on the pipeline. The RRS method concentrates on using the relative risk scoring method of machine learning to perform the integrity and qualitative risk assessment of pipelines while taking into account all of these situations and factors. The focal objectives of this research are: 1. There are other studies that are dependent on specific aspects, such as leakage, corrosion, etc., but none of them offer a specific solution for all of the problems that are widespread. 2. The Research focus to assess the risk of pipelines by calculating the Relative Risk Score (RRS) method. 3. The RRS approach takes many parameters into account that could impact a pipeline. The methodology that is being suggested here aims to lessen the harm happens due to harmful gases, chemicals, and petroleum products inflict on people and other living things. 4. To demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the novel approach the RRS method contrast it with Naive Bayes, Decision tree, SVM, and GCN. The arrangement of this research paper is as per the following: The existing methodologies and literature background for pipeline assessment are presented in Segment 2. The terminologies related to the pipeline assessment are explained in Segment 3. The proposed RRS algorithm using machine learning is elaborated in Segment 4. The experimental setup and the discussion of results are presented in segment 5, and the research is concluded in segment 6. Literature review Risk assessment of chemical pipelines The use of machine learning techniques in pipeline risk assessment has been a topic of increasing interest in recent years. Sohaib et al. 5 proposed a method for detecting leaks in circular water storage tanks in the chemical sector using acoustic emissions. Support vector machines are used to locate the exact location of the crack or leakage. Mazumder et al. 7 used machine learning algorithms to analyze the risk of failure of a steel pipeline. The research developed an alternative to statistically intensive analytical methods to estimate the steel pipeline failure threat. However, the research could not be fully realized due to the lack of adequate data for use in actual situations. Yang et al. 8 demonstrated urban gas data-driven pipeline accidents and consequences assessment using machine learning. The accidents in UPN may cause environmental disasters. Urban pipeline maintenance is related to the major facets of data. The work uses conventional assessment for risk models like the Kent index method and analytic evaluation indicators. The graph convolutional network (GCN) technique is used to assess the risk associated with pipelines. Liu and Bao 9 reviewed automated conditions for the assessment of pipelines with machine learning. Pipelines, which transport intense substances, play a significant role in societal safety and commercial prosperity. Pipeline condition assessments are required to identify the risk. Wu et al. 10 presented FTAP: A feature-transferring autonomous machine learning pipeline. Successful machine learning 11 frequently involves significant involvement with algorithms and expert knowledge in the field. The ML methods heavily rely on domain-specific information. FTAP improves efficiency and performance. It has also achieved success in distance domain transfer learning. He et al. 12 used Geographical Information System at the threat location to develop a genetic and back propagation prototype to forecast the occurrence of a geographical calamity and avert pipeline damage. The GA-BP model is used to estimate weights of the indication factor by utilising the benefits of analysing data and predictive analytics, which avoid the subjective authority of earlier calculation methods. Malinowska et al. 13 showed off a model that uses Mamdani fuzzy inference for the study. In this method, the hazards in the pipeline due to the estimated horizontal strains, the solidity of the material, the time span of an unfavourable effect, and the importance of the targets are evaluated on the basis of one level. The prototype is used to assess the risk of an arranged gas pipe with systematic variables. This can also be used to stimulate further scientific variations of the examined item. Bu et al. 14 investigated how soil-atmosphere coupling affects gas pipeline 15 leakage. The joining process of methane leakage was calculated using arithmetic stimulation, and the effects of many factors on methane convergence in FDZ and SDZ were investigated. This analysis provides guidelines for the planning of gas pipes, improving the installation of detectors, and gas leakage 16 maintenance. Liu et al. 17 demonstrated a dynamic danger estimation prototype depending on system dynamics (SD). Most of the pipeline risk assessments provide a static outline of the process. This model is to manage both the issue of given activity and changes there within a period. The solution provided the dynamic developments of principles of buried pipelines threat are compatible with real circumstances. This prototype adequately distinguishes the temporal and spatial principles of threat evolution. Adumene et al. 18 presented a method that combines the semi-empirical corrosion prototype with material used and parametric uncertainties. The pipe failure rises with a rise in factor of difference at the minimum limit of futile, while reduces in the maximum limit of futile. This method provides an organized structure for choosing material and threat-based integrity management plans for sea pipelines. Froeling et al. 19 demonstrated the danger of dangerous hydrogen jet fire transported through gas pipelines 20 , 21 . This analysis focuses on threats associated with a dangerous hydrogen fire, such as an invisible spray with a gas pipeline 22 . Using analytical software, it performs a detailed fire imitation and condition of the artwork. When compared to a gas pipeline, the ignition effects influence the threat for reducing pipe diameters and causing hydrogen transference to capitulate an increased hazard. Taleb-Berroune et al. 23 suggested a prototype for the risk assessment for the deterioration of pipelines utilising adaptive bow-tie (ABT) analysis. The ABT model used for this analysis is engrossed in microbiologically impacted pipeline deterioration, as well as a corrosion economic risk profile. This prototype serves as a procedure to recognize, evaluate, and maintain the corrosion of the pipeline. Wang et al. 24 initiated a susceptibility assessment technique for the danger assessment of the gas pipe system. It integrates the features of threat assessment and susceptible analysis methods. Risk susceptibility classifies its critical components into three categories: the operating status of the pipeline, transmission performance, and network features. A utility proposition is employed to identify the depth of the outturn. This method balances the lower part of the threat, trustability, and susceptibility curves to adequately recognise the unfavourable joints and pipelines damaging gas supply in a pipeline network. Zulkifli and Salleh 25 analysed the effect of movement and pipe construction actions at various pressures and pipe widths on the pipeline in the UTHM biodiesel plant. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique helped them to examine the velocity and pressure dispersion, while the Interaction of Fluid Structure (FSI) method enabled them to examine the stress distribution on the pipes according to their thicknesses. The study found that the breadth of the pipe affects the flow rate and pressure in the region of the pipe, and pressure diffusion is reduced as quality improves. Additionally, when pressure increases, the storm created within the pipe also increases. Risk assessment of buried pipelines Li et al. 26 proposed a method to analyse and maintain gas pipelines externally based on Bayesian networks. Buried gas pipelines 27 are often exposed to natural calamities, leading to corrosion. To identify the cause of pipeline deterioration, the study used a defective tree prototype and implanted the maintenance plan in the Bayesian network. This approach provides an adequate maintenance plan for pipelines and reduces losses caused by external corrosion. Jabbari et al. 28 used a down-covered logical hierarchy procedure to assess the risk of poisonous gas discharge and outburst in gas pipelines 29 . An analysis of danger was carried out using MATLAB software, and the mass of each item in basic risk (BRI) was outlined in a reference frame. The study found that five-state norms determine the level of threat. This method is applicable to the security chief when making decisions associated with the hazardous evaluation of a gas pipeline. Yin et al. 30 presented an upgraded quantifiable danger assessment for gas pipelines, considering high-importance areas. Given that most gas discharge incidents in China occur in crowded areas, the study established two models: a failure probability 31 model and a risk consequence model. This approach can adequately recognize significant areas and produce reliable outcomes. Chen et al. 32 proposed a danger analysis method for buried pipes based on an upgraded cloud variable weight thesis. The study offered a new way of using the cloud variable weight hypothesis to examine the hazard amount and consequential danger factor of a pipeline by setting up a threat evaluation index system for the pipeline. This method assists the supervisor in determining the threat level and sore point in the pipeline. Wang et al. 33 developed a technique for evaluating the existence of deteriorated pipeline balances and assessing the threat of pipeline defaulter conditions in the face of an unexpected current attack. The study used a Monte Carlo simulation approach to determine the impedance caused by electrochemical reactions and the unreliability of prototype variables. The balance course of the corrosive ecological variables remains remarkably constant, except for the dynamic stray current immersed by the pipeline. Mederios et al. 34 presented a technique to deal with multi-dimensional risks occurring in gas pipelines based on unexpected utility. The study accomplished multi-dimensional risk evaluation of gas pipelines in decision-making and used a non-expected utility method in the MRDU prototype. The deflection of usefulness was surveyed, and this included the benefit from an RDU (rank dependent utility)-based danger proposal. The study conducted similar outcome analysis and sensitivity testing, and this method provides great support to the decision-makers with regard to natural gas pipeline sections. Ullah et al. 35 assessed the rockburst patterns s of the Jinping-II hydropower project in China to enhance employee security in mining and geotechnical works. In the present work, the following methods were used to predict short-term rock burst threat: t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), K-means clustering, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The implied model's results provide an excellent standard to guide future short-term rock burst levels forecasting with excellent precision. Kamran et al. 36 proposed a model to reducing rockburst-related mortality. In this study, firstly,isometric mapping (ISOMAP) algorithm is used.then, ISOMAP was categorized using the fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) and at last, in order to predict different levels of the short-term rockburst dataset, KNearest Neighbour (KNN) was used. In the experiment's dataset, the suggested model properly categorised 96% of the rockburst occurrences. Kamran et al. 37 utilized the algorithms like Catboost and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) techniques with the objective to reduce the number of casualties and property damage associated with deep underground engineering tasks. Here, Catboost and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) techniques to examine several intriguing elements of mine fire statistics. The results show that LightGBM algorithms, having an accuracy of 92% and 89%, respectively, outperformed Catboost in terms of performance. Kumaran et al. 38 introduces a novel approach to foresee the stability of underground coal pillars utilising integrated unsupervised and supervised learning to roughly simulate the complicated behaviour of coal pillars. Kumaran et al. 39 proposed a novel approach to forecast mine fire levels using a variety of machine learning approaches. After examining various literature, pipelines are exposed to various physical and chemical environmental issues. These result in the explosion of chemicals, which lead to the spread of various diseases to humans, fire accidents, and natural calamities like land pollution, landslides, earthquakes, etc. The literature that is examined only with minimal parameters that affect the pipeline and does not contain important parameters to which the pipeline is exposed. In a specific assessment, the need for integrity and qualitative risk assessment of pipelines with various parameters such as corrosion, leakage, coating, materials, atmosphere, surface, earth movements, population, above-ground and underground facilities, and so on is identified. The existing methodologies focused only on the risk of pipelines and assessing that particular risk. This may lead to catastrophic disasters where the pipeline is being implanted. So, an efficient relative risk score (RRS) method is proposed by assessing the pipeline using the RRS method with various parameters that affect the pipelines, which is greatly helpful and safe to transmit materials through the pipelines. Related terminologies Pipeline integrity management (PIM) Pipelines are the best-grounded and cheapest mode for transporting oil, fluids, and natural gas. Pipeline networks 2 are large and complicated; they consume time and are often intensive for inquiring about a lot of pipelines. PIM is executed to reduce the possibility of remissness caused by the debasement and to maintain the programmability and security of pipelines. Despite the warnings to avoid transporting natural gas, fluids, and oil, these pipes are subjected to deteriorating conditions. The PIM are used to define the systematic approach, identify the possible risk by way of danger, and apply the preventive methods. The research focuses on the basic objectives of pipeline integrity management (PIM) to improve confidence among the public in pipeline safety and operator management. It improves the operational processes to maintain the integrity of the pipeline. The primary goal of PIM is to ensure pipeline reliability, prevent incidents, and maintain the operation license. These integration activities generate the data with 3 V’s (a huge amount of volume, velocity, and variety) based on the pipeline’s length and the sensors and tools that are used to access the condition of pipelines. The pipeline should ensure not only the mechanical condition but also the operator's reliable operation, delivery duty, image, and estimation. Risk assessment Danger estimation and management is the term used to describe the general method for identifying the danger and the risk factors that have the potential to cause damage. Analyzing and evaluating the problem that is associated with the hazard. The tools used for risk assessment are the risk matrix, decision tree, failure modes and effects analysis. Since the oil, fluids, and natural gas pipes are burnable, they will be dangerous and toxic. The outflow in the pipeline can cause catastrophic effects like fire explosions and environmental pollution. Risk assessments used to reduce risk include baseline, issue-based, and continuous risk assessments. Pipeline assessment entails closely inspecting pipeline inner and outer sections to determine corrosion rates, flow modeling, and profile calculation. The two components of pipeline risks are leaks and ruptures. The risk in the pipeline 40 can be monitored by using supervisory control and data acquisition systems, which collects data about the pipeline operations and transmit the data to engineers or technicians if some problem occurs. The security cameras and sensors, fibre-optic cables, and temperature sensors placed on or near the pipelines can also check for leakages and corrosion to prevent them from becoming dangerous. Machine learning in PIM Machine learning 41 concentrates on integrity, maintenance, inspection, analysing the crack, and preventing corrosion in pipelines. In pipeline integrity management, the two categories of ML classification and regression are used. Classification is used for detecting leakage, identifying the defect type, and predicting the level of risk in pipelines. Regression is used for calculating the size of the defect and predicting the rate of debasement in pipelines. For pipeline integrity management, clustering identical pipeline 42 segments based on identical operating conditions, materials used for establishment, and debasement mechanisms are taken into account for the assessment of risk. Classifier techniques used in prediction The Classification algorithm is a Supervised Learning technique utilized in order to categorize new observations, on the premise of training data. In classification, a system makes use of the dataset or observations that are provided to learn how to categorize fresh observations into various classes or groups. In this research, three classifier models such as support vector machine (SVM), Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes are used to identify the chance of pipeline failures, based on a variety of input characteristics. Support vector machine (SVM) Collecting and pre-processing the data is the initial stage in the use of SVM for pipeline risk assessment. Data collection on pipeline parameters, environmental variables, and information on previous pipeline failures are necessary. $$y\_i(\left(w*x\_i\right)+b)=1\,for\,all\,i$$ (1) where y_i is the class for the i-th data point, x_i is the input vector for the i-th data point, b is the bias term. Decision tree It functions by creating a tree-like model of choices and potential outcomes. Each node in a decision tree indicates a choice made in response to a particular characteristic or attribute of the data. Up until a stopping requirement is satisfied, the data are recursively divided into subsets based on the values of the characteristics. This terminating criterion can be a predetermined tree depth or the minimal quantity of samples needed in a leaf node. The leaf nodes represent the class labels. By estimating the possibility of a pipeline failure or leak based on different characteristics like the age of the pipeline, the material it is constructed of, the operating pressure, and the location, decision trees can be utilized for pipeline assessment. $$Information\,Gain=Entropy\left(S\right)- [\left(Weighted\,Avg\right)*\left(Entropy\left(each\,feature\right)\right)]$$ (2) The above Eq. 2 calculates how much information a feature provides us about a class $$Entropy\left( S \right) = - P\left( {\text{positive classes}} \right) log_{2} P\left( {\text{positive classes}} \right) - P\left( {\text{negative classes}} \right) log_{2} P\left( {\text{negative classes}} \right)$$ (3) $$gini\,index= 1- {\sum}_{j=1}^{C}{{\mathrm{P}}_{j}}^{2}$$ (4) The above Eqs. 2 , 3 and 4 calculate entropy and gini index. C also represents the number of events (groups). The entropy and Gini index is a measure of impurity or purity used while creating a decision tree. Naïve Bayes This is also using the different characteristics of pipeline to assess. It is possible to identify high-risk pipelines and set priorities for maintenance and inspection work by utilising a Naive Bayes algorithm for pipeline assessment. The Naive Bayes algorithm is excellent for huge datasets since it is easy to use and computationally effective. The Naive Bayes algorithm for pipeline evaluation involves utilising the Bayes theorem to determine the likelihood of a pipeline failure or leak given its characteristics. Proposed RRS methodology a. System model of risk assessment of pipelines using machine learning The research focuses on qualitative risk assessment and the integrity of pipelines using relative risk scoring methods in machine learning. Relative risk scoring is an index model in which important conditions and activities of the pipeline are assigned numerical values (scores) that contribute to risk. Depending on the needs of the assessment, multiple layers of the layered hierarchy in which the relative risk scoring algorithm is designed may be necessary.

When these three algorithms are compared, the Relative Risk Scoring method has the highest percentage accuracy in detecting leakage. Based on this analysis, the graph shows that the RRS method is the most effective method for calculating leakage accuracy. From above Figs. 8 and 9 , it is proven that SVM and GCN are individually better in the aspect of predicting leakage and corrosion but, RRS is better than them in both aspects. Figure 9 Identification of risk due to leakage. Full size image The methodology was carefully designed and tested to ensure that it is reliable. The RRS methodology has achieved only 93% of recall which can be improved with further addition of experiments. The proposed methodology has several advantages, the risk of the pipeline is predicted using various parameters including corrosion, leakage and other damages so that the risk of the pipeline is not over calculated. Thus, the leakage, corrosion and other damages are not predicted separately. Hence, this method is more accurate to calculate the risk of the pipeline than other methodologies. Conclusion In conclusion, pipelines serve as the backbone of the global transportation network for products such as oil, water, and gas. However, the safe and efficient operation of pipelines requires comprehensive risk assessment. Our study presents the RRS method, a novel approach to risk assessment that considers a wide range of parameters, including those often overlooked in existing methodologies. The RRS algorithm provides more accurate results for calculating leakage, corrosion, and classification, with accuracies of 96.5%, 94.7%, and 94.3%, respectively. Compared to the Decision Tree algorithm, the RRS method executes much faster, reducing the time and cost associated with risk assessment. Overall, the RRS method represents a significant advancement in pipeline risk assessment. Its ability to provide more accurate results, faster execution time, and comprehensive consideration of all parameters makes it a more reliable and efficient approach. The RRS method has the potential to improve the safety and efficiency of pipeline operation in the future, providing a safer, more cost-effective, and more sustainable approach to transporting products across the globe. Thus, we conclude that the RRS method is a reliable and efficient approach for risk assessment of pipelines.
