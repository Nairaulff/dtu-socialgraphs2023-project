Introduction The study of controlled and rapid propagation of information via light is one the most emerging areas of research and development in the field of photonic device technology 1 . The current developments in the material science and engineering have attracted many researchers working in the photonic engineering to develop optoelectronic devices of nano-scale dimensions 2 . Photonic crystals (PCs) have the magnificent capabilities of handling the time orientated technological challenges successfully as per the industrial demand. The ease of fabrication involved in one-dimensional (1d) photonic structures has given them edge over two-dimensional (2d) and three-dimensional (3d) photonic structures 3 . The participation of different materials layers in the unit cell of the PC may allow them to group into binary, ternary, quaternary photonic structures. The directional repetition of unit cell into large number is responsible for formation of 1d, 2d or 3d photonic structures. PCs have an especial property of photonic band gaps (PBGs) due to the periodic repetition of layers of different refractive indices leading to the constructive and destructive interference between the rays of electromagnetic waves (EMWs) refracted and reflected from the interfaces separating any two media of the structure respectively because of multiple Bragg scattering 4 , 5 . The frequencies of EMWs interfere destructively are not allowed to pass through the structure and are responsible for creation of PBG. If the deformity is created into the photonic structure, a defect mode of high transmittance appears inside PBG. The position and intensity of the defect mode is dependent upon the refractive index of the deformity 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . This excellent property of PCs has attracted the attention of the researchers to use them for various biosensing applications 10 , 11 . Cancer is a most common diseases which allows the uncontrollable growth of cell in human body and has ability to infect any part of the human body 12 , 13 . Actually, human body allow the growth of new cell which multiply together to form new cells as per the requirement of the body. The lifetime of every cell is fixed so when the cells become old or damaged body may develop new cells automatically to replace older one 14 . But the present life style is breaking down this natural process of cell regeneration and allowing the abnormal growth of damaged or deadly cells in the human body 15 . The lumps of trillions of damaged cells or tissues inside human body are called as tumor which may be cancerous or non-cancerous 16 . Cancerous tumor is also called as malignant which has life threatening impact on human life. Most of the cancers are in solid form, malignancy may also exist is human in medical science blood cancer disease is known as leukemia 17 . Human body send signals to the normal cells for their development, cancerous cells start developing without getting any signal of their development. Normally deadly cells are extracted or eliminated by our immune system, extraction is not done in the case of cancerous cells 18 . The prevention of malignancy can be only achieved if we could identify the growth of deadly cells in time. The early stage detection of malignancy is only possible if we could have full proof diagnosis mechanism which could provide precise, rapid and cost-effective results. Presently several cancer cell detection techniques are being used in the early stage and timely detection of cancerous cells in human body. Nowadays, microfluidic, plasmonic and photonic biosensing, immunocyte-chemistry and electrochemical technique-based devices are being used for early and timely detection of cancers cells in human body 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 . Recently Chung-Ting et al. presented a sensitive plasmonic biosensing design whose unit cell is composed of closed loop dual band perfect absorber using intersection nanostructure for detection of malignant cells of human body 23 . Moreover, Malek et al. have discussed the high sensitive biosensor composed of 1d defective ternary photonic crystal for early stage detection of cancerous cells of sensitivity 3282.09 nm/RIU 24 . The work of Malek et al. motivated us for this study to design ultra-sensitive biosensor for cancer cell detection. In the current study, the optical properties of the 1d defective ternary photonic crystal (DTPC) have been used for the detection of cancerous cell in human body 24 . We have used in the calculations and simulations the transfer matrix formulation in addition to MATLAB software. Both normal and oblique incidence corresponding to s polarized incident EMWs have been considered in this study. For achieving ultra-high sensitivity from the 1d DTPC while investigating various cancerous cells we have studied the effect of change in period number, incident angle and the thickness of the defect layer on the performance of the design. The organization of the paper is as under. “ Introduction ” section deals with introduction. Structural design and theoretical formulation are presented in “ Structural design and its realization ” and “ Theoretical formulation ” sections respectively. Results and discussions are written in “ Results and discussions ” section. Finally, conclusions are discussed in “ Conclusion ” section of this manuscript. Structural design and its realization The proposed design has been configured by introducing a defect layer D of air at the centre of two ternary photonic crystals such that (ABC) N /D/(ABC) S /Substrate. Here alphabets A, B, and C are being used to represent layers of materials Si, Pbs and SiO 2 respectively. The letters N and S are used to represent period number which is equal in our case. The architecture of the proposed design air/(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) N /Defect/(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) S /air is shown in Fig. 1 . The refractive indices and thicknesses of layers A, B, C and D of are denoted by n 1 , n 2 , n 3, n d and d 1 , d 2 , d 3 , d d respectively. The refractive indices of the ambient media and substrate of the structure are denoted by n 0 and n s respectively which are air in this case. The numeric values of refractive indices and thicknesses of different layers including semi-infinite media are being presented in Table 1 below.

Full size image Table 1 Description of refractive indices and thicknesses of different material layers. Full size table Theoretical formulation For the simulation of results pertaining to the proposed research work based on TMM, we have used MATLAB programming by using transfer matrix method. The electric and magnetic fields amplitudes at incident media to exit media are connected of through resulting transfer matrix F as 6 , 25 , 26 , 27 $$F=\left(\begin{array}{c}{F}_{11}{F}_{12}\\ {F}_{21}{F}_{22}\end{array}\right)={\left({f}_{1}{f}_{2}{f}_{3}\right)}^{N}\left({f}_{D}\right){\left({f}_{1}{f}_{2}{f}_{3}\right)}^{S}.$$ (1) Here F 11 , F 12 , F 21 and F 22 are the elements of matrix F representing whole structure. The 2 by 2 matrix representing individual layers A , B , C and D of DTPCs have been shown by f 1 , f 2 , f 3 and f D respectively. The transmission coefficient representing proposed 1D DTPC air/(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) N /Defect/(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) S /air can be evaluated with the help of following expression as 28 , 29 , 30 $$t=\frac{2{\alpha }_{I}}{\left({F}_{11}+{F}_{12}{\alpha }_{S}\right){\alpha }_{I}+\left({F}_{21}+{F}_{22}{\alpha }_{S}\right)},$$ (2) where admittance of incident and exit ends of the structure corresponding to s polarized ware are shown by \({\alpha }_{I}={n}_{0}{\text{cos}}{\gamma }_{0}\) and \({\alpha }_{S}={n}_{S}{\text{cos}}{\gamma }_{S}\) respectively and for p polarized incident wave, \({\alpha }_{I}=\frac{{\text{cos}}{\gamma }_{0}}{{n}_{0}}\) and \({\alpha }_{I}=\frac{{\text{cos}}{\gamma }_{S}}{{n}_{S}}\) . The symbols γ 0 and γ S are representing angle of incident and angle of emergence respectively. Finally, transmittance can be obtained as 30 , 31 , 32 $$T=\left(\frac{{\alpha }_{S}}{{\alpha }_{I}}t{t}^{*}\right)\times 100.$$ (3) The performance of the biosensor based on 1D TPC has been evaluated with the help of one of the most popular parameters named as sensitivity. Actually, while observing the sensitivity of any biosensing structure the ratio of change in the central wavelength of resonant peak ( \(\delta \lambda \) ) due to alteration in the refractive index of the sample ( \(\delta n\) ) under investigation is named as sensitivity of the design. It determines how minutely the biosensor can detect the change in the refractive index of the sample under investigation. It is defined as 33 , 34 , 35 $$S=\frac{\delta \lambda }{\delta n}\left(\text{nm/RIU}\right).$$ (4) Results and discussions The refractive indices of different samples containing various cancerous cells of human body examined in this work are presented in Table 2 . Table 2 Refractive index details of samples containing various cells 24 . Full size table In this paper we have examined the change in the position of defect mode due to the corresponding change in the sample poured into cavity region D of the structure. First, we have loaded the proposed design with a sample containing normal cell of human body and simulated the transmission spectra showing a defect mode of unit transmittance positioned at a wavelength 2928.7386 nm inside PBG of the structure extending from 2155 to 3800 nm as shown in Fig. 2 . Figure 2 Transmission spectrum of the proposed design {air/(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) N /Defect /(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) S /air} loaded with sample containing normal cell under normal incidence (θ 0 = 0°, d 1 = 95 nm, d 2 = 155 nm, d 3 = 235 nm, d D = 800 nm, n 1 = 3.3, n 2 = 4.2, n 3 = 1.46 and N = S = 5). Full size image An enlarged view of Fig. 2 has been shown in Fig. 3 below. It is showing the clear picture of defect mode centered at 2928.7386 nm. This figure is very useful for obtaining the numeric values of central wavelength of the defect mode and its full width half maximum as mentioned above. Figure 3 An enlarged view of Fig. 2 showing the defect mode position inside PBG of proposed design {air/(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) N /Defect /(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) S /air} at θ 0 = 0°. Full size image Next, we have examined the response of the proposed design loaded with samples containing normal, Jurkat, Hela, PC12, MDH-MB231, MCF-7, White matter, Low grade glioma, Glioblastoma cells of human body separately with respect to sample containing normal cells of human body under normal incidence condition. The transmittance response of the proposed biosensor loaded separately with the samples as per the details given in Table 2 is shown in Fig. 4 . It has been observed from Fig. 4 that as sample containing cancerous cells Jurkat to Glioblastoma the respective defect modes start shifting towards higher wavelength side inside PBG of the structure. This movement of defect mode corresponding to samples of different cells is governed by the condition of standing wave inside laser cavity as discussed in Eq. ( 5 ) below 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 Figure 4 Transmission spectra of the proposed design {air/(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) N /Defect /(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) S /air} loaded with samples containing normal, Jurkat, Hela, PC12, MDA-MB231, MCF-7, White matter, Low grade glioma and Glioblastoma cells independently under normal incidence ( θ 0 = 0°, d 1 = 95 nm, d 2 = 155 nm, d 3 = 235 nm, d D = 800 nm, n 1 = 3.3, n 2 = 4.2, n 3 = 1.46 and N = 5). Full size image $$\varphi =s\lambda ={n}_{eff}\rho .$$ (5) Here symbols φ and ρ are being used to show optical and geometrical path differences between the propagating waves inside structure. The notations s , λ and n eff are representing free space wavelength of the light injected into the structure, an integer and effective refractive index of the structure respectively. The increase in the refractive index of the sample poured into the defect layer region D of the structure also increases the n eff which in turn allow the movement of the defect mode inside PBG towards higher wavelength side to keep φ remains same. The movement of all defect modes dependent upon the sample poured into the cavity region D of the structure is measured with respect to the defect mode arises due to sample containing normal cell as shown with black colour in Fig. 4 . The defect mode position shift in the central wavelength of the defect mode position due to change in the refractive index of the sample with respect to the central wavelength of defect mode associated with the sample containing normal cell and the sensitivity of the structure loaded with various samples independently are being summarized in Table 3 below. All these values have been obtained with the help of Fig. 4 in addition to Eq. ( 5 ). Table 3 Performance evaluation table showing position of defect mode, shift in the position of defect mode due to change in the refractive index of sample containing various cancerous cells with respect to the sample containing normal cell and the sensitivity of the proposed structure loaded with different cells under normal incidence θ 0 = 0°. Full size table It is evident from the data of Table 3 that the sensitivity of proposed structure loaded separately with different samples varies between maximum of 1181.0225 and 1164.146392 nm/RIU corresponding to the samples containing Jurkat to Glioblastoma cells respectively under normal incidence. The effect of the incident angle on the sensitivity Next, attempts have been further given to improve the sensitivity of the proposed structure loaded independently with samples containing various cancerous cells with respect to normal cell. This purpose has been achieved by increasing the angle of incidence from θ 0 = 0° to θ 0 = 85° in steps of 5° corresponding to s-polarized light only. The defect mode position representing the shift in the central wavelength of the defect mode due to change in the refractive index of the samples with respect to the central wavelength of defect mode associated with the sample containing normal cell and sensitivity of the proposed structure loaded with samples as discussed in Table 2 corresponding to incident angle θ 0 = 5°, 10°, 15°, 20°, 25°, 30°, 35°, 40°, 45°, 50°, 55°, 60°, 65°, 70°, 75°, 80° and 85° under s-polarized wave are given in Tables 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 and 20 respectively. It has been observed from Tables 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 and 20 that as incident angle increases from 0° to 85° the performance of the structure also increases as the sensitivity increases. The sensitivity reaches to maximum of 1838.387629 nm/RIU when the cavity is loaded with the sample containing Glioblastoma cell as evident from Table 20 .

Full size table The average sensitivity of all structures loaded independently with the samples containing different cancerous cells as obtained from Tables 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 and 20 are listed in Table 21 below. Table 21 Angle dependent average sensitivity of the proposed design loaded with various samples under investigation. Full size table The angle dependent average sensitivity variations of the structure loaded independently with samples are being plotted in Fig. 5 for better understanding. It can be clearly seen from the Fig. 5 that the sensitivity of the proposed designed reaches to maximum when angle of incidence is set to 85°. Figure 5 Angle dependent average sensitivity of ternary photonic structure with defect of structural parameters d 1 = 95 nm, d 2 = 155 nm, d 3 = 235 nm, n 1 = 3.3, n 2 = 4.2, n 3 = 1.46, d D = 1D and N = 5 corresponding to s-polarized wave. Full size image We have also investigated the impact of change in the angle of incidence on the full width half maximum of resonant peak which in turn affects the performance of the proposed biosensor composed of 1D ternary photonic structure with defect. For this purpose, we have studied the how the positions of left and right edges of defect mode inside photonic band gap of the structure loaded independently with normal sample of refractive index 1.35 corresponding to θ° = 0°, 5°, 10°, 15°, 20°, 25°, 30°, 35°, 40°, 45°, 50°, 55°, 60°, 65°, 70°, 75°, 80° and 85° under s polarized light vary. In fact, this analysis gives us insight while selecting the bests suitable incident angle for our design. Table 22 summarizes the average shifting of left and right edges of defect mode in PBG of the structure loaded independently with all sample dependent upon the incident angle corresponding to s-polarized light. Table 22 An angle dependent average shifting of left and right edges of defect mode associated with the structure loaded independently with all samples. Full size table It can be seen from the Table 6 that as incident angle increases from 0° to 85° the left and right band edges of defect mode start moving towards lower wavelength side, also their FWHM decreases. Figure 6 below visualize the data presented in above table. It is evident from the Fig. 6 that as incident angle increases from 0° to 85° the FWHM of defect mode starts reducing and becomes lowest at θ 0 = 80°. Further increase in the incident angle results very minute change in the FWHM of the defect mode at θ 0 = 85° it becomes 0.057001243 nm. Thus θ 0 = 85° has been considered as an optimum value of an incident angle corresponding to which our structure becomes sensitive as evident from Table 20 .

Full size table It can be observed from Tables 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 and 31 that the sensitivity of the structure loaded independently with carcinogenic samples with respect to normal sample increases as cavity layer thickness of the structure increases under normal incidence.

The pictorial representation of the data of Table 32 has been shown in Fig. 7 . It helps us to estimate the optimum value of the cavity layer thickness for the proposed structure. It shows that the average sensitivity of the thickness initially increases rapidly as the cavity layer thickness up to d D = 2400 nm. Further increase in the cavity layer thickness results moderate enhancement in the average sensitivity of the structure. After d D = 5600 nm the sensitivity increases slowly. The average sensitivity of our design reaches to 1419.107092 nm/RIU which is maximum at θ 0 = 0°.

For this purpose, we have chosen cavity layer thickness d D = 800 nm and θ 0 = 0° along with other structural parameters which are identical as discussed above. To get the optimized value of the period number N of the structure we have considered four values of N = S = 3, 4, 5 and 6.

Full size table Figure 8 Plot showing average sensitivity of different structures of period number N = 3, 4, 5 and 6 with cavity layer thickness d D = 800 nm under normal incidence. Full size image It is evident form Fig. 8 that the increase in the period number results the drastic fall in the sensitivity of the structure which reaches to minimum when the period number N goes to 6. Thus N = 3 is the optimized value for our design which corresponds to maximum average sensitivity of 1199.179484 nm/RIU under normal incidence with d D = 800 nm. Additionally, we have also examined the impact of period number on the average shifting of left and right edges of defect mode for determination the FWHM of our design loaded with all samples independently under normal incidence with cavity of thickness d D = 800 nm. The shift in the left and right edges of defect mode due to change in the period number of the structure is presented in Table 37 below.

Full size table The pictorial representation of the data has been shown in the Fig. 9 below. It shows that the average value of the FWHM of the defect mode corresponding to optimum period number 3 is 11.5732787 nm. Any deviation in the period number from 3 results the deduction in the FWHM value of our design which reaches to minimum at N = 6. Figure 9 Depiction of period number dependent average shifting of left and right edges of defect mode associated with the structure loaded with all samples independently at θ 0 = 0° and d D = 800 nm. Full size image Analysis of the performance of the structure with optimized parameters After optimizing the incident angle corresponding to s-polarized incident wave, thickness of the cavity region and period number of the structure as 85°, 8000 nm and 3 respectively, we have given our efforts to analyze the performance of the under the influence of optimized external and internal parameters of the proposed structure as θ 0 = 85° and d D = 8000 nm and N = 3 respectively. First, we have designed the defective ternary photonic structure of period number 3 and cavity thickness 8000 nm which is loaded independently with all samples. The s-polarized incident light is allowed pass through the structure at an incident angle 85°. The transmitted energy of defect mode located inside PBG of the structure is measured with the help of an optical spectrum analyzer via output port. The transmittance spectra of the proposed defective ternary photonic structure {air/(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) N /Defect/(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) S /air} loaded independently with sample containing normal cells as well as 8 carcinogenic cells at θ 0 = 85° with d 1 = 95 nm, d 2 = 155 nm, d 3 = 235 nm, d D = 8000 nm, n 1 = 3.3, n 2 = 4.2, n 3 = 1.46 and N = 3 are being shown in Fig. 10 . It can be clearly seen from Fig. 10 that as sample containing various cells is changed from normal to Glioblastoma in accordance with Table 2 the position of defect mode inside PBG starts moving towards higher wavelength side due to increase in the refractive indices of the samples. Moreover, FWHM of the defect mode also increases due to this movement which becomes maximum corresponding to sample containing Glioblastoma cells. This increase in the FWHM of the defect mode does not have any impact on the resolution of the peak. Figure 10 Transmission spectra of the proposed design {air/(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) N /Defect /(Si/Pbs/SiO 2 ) S /air} loaded with samples containing normal, Jurkat, Hela, PC12, MDA-MB231, MCF-7, White matter, Low grade glioma and Glioblastoma cells independently at θ 0 = 85°, d 1 = 95 nm, d 2 = 155 nm, d 3 = 235 nm, d D = 8000 nm, n 1 = 3.3, n 2 = 4.2, n 3 = 1.46 and N = 3. The black, yellow, blue, green, red, cyan, pink, brown and silver colour defect modes are corresponding to the sample containing normal, Jurkat, Hela, PC12, MDA-MB231, MCF-7, White matter, Low grade glioma and Glioblastoma cells respectively. Full size image The defect mode position inside PBG, shift in the central wavelength of defect mode and the sensitivity of the structure of cavity thickness d D = 8000 nm and period number N = 3 loaded independently with all samples with respect to normal sample at θ 0 = 85° corresponding to s-polarized wave have been obtained with the help of Fig. 10 . These values have been recorded in Table 38 below. It is evident from the data of Table 38 that as the refractive index of the sample under investigation increases the defect mode position shifted to higher wavelength side in such a way that the shift in the defect mode position associated with sample also increases with respect to the position of defect mode due to sample containing normal cells. Additionally, the sensitivity of the structure under optimized condition varies from maximum of 4325.0875 nm/RIU to minimum of 4155.13505 nm/RIU corresponding to samples containing Jurkat to Glioblastoma cells respectively. Under optimum conditions the average sensitivity of the proposed structure becomes 4270.525928 nm/RIU which is tremendously enhanced.

Full size table Analysis of the optimized structure based on other important sensing parameters This section deals with the analysis of the proposed biosensing structure composed of one-dimensional ternary photonic structure by means of some other important sensing parameters which are very popular and significant in the design and development of plasmonic and photonic biosensors. In addition to sensitivity we have extended the performance evaluation of the proposed structure by calculating numeric values of quality factor (QF), detection limit (DL), sensor resolution (SR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), detection range (DR), detection accuracy (DA), figure of merit (FOM) and standard deviation \({(\sigma }_{peak})\) of our optimized design loaded independently with sample containing normal and eight carcinogenic cells separately 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 . All these calculated values have been listed in Table 39 below. Table 39 Performance evaluation table showing numeric values of quality factor (QF), detection limit (DL), sensor resolution (SR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), detection range (DR), detection accuracy (DA), figure of merit (FOM) and standard deviation \({(\sigma }_{peak})\) due to change in the refractive index of sample containing various cancerous cells with respect to the sample containing normal cell of our optimized structure with cavity thickness d D = 8000 nm and period number N = 3 at θ 0 = 85° corresponding to s-polarized incident light. Full size table It has been observed from the data of Table 39 that a FOM value of the proposed sensor varies from 14,711.45719 to 7131.300658 which is high as expected. Additionally, QF and DR values of the proposed structure are also high. The order of the detection limit of the structure is quite low and highlights the minute detection capabilities of our design. The SR, SNR, DA and \({\sigma }_{peak}\) values obtained from transmission spectra as shown in Fig. 10 are as per our expectation. These values are supporting our claim of designing ultra-high sensitive biosensor for detection of carcinogenic cells with respect to normal cell. Comparing between the sensitivity of the current work with earlier reported work Finally, we have compared our findings with the recent work published by various research groups between 2018 and 2021. In this comparison authors have surveyed various biosensing structures based on photonic refractometric technology. The classified information based on the survey has been presented in Table 40 below. It shows that the proposed structure can be used for designing of ultra-high sensitive biophotonic sensors. This study may provide technological designing insight to the people who are working in the fabrication of biophotonic sensors. Table 40 Comparison between the sensitivity of proposed photonic structure with earlier work. Full size table Conclusion In conclusion, we have theoretically examined the biosensing capabilities of 1D defective ternary photonic crystal for accurate and minute identification of cancer cells with respect to normal cell. Both MATLAB computational software and transfer matrix method have been used for obtaining result of this manuscript. The present biosensor works on the principal of refractometric sensing. We have demonstrated how the change in the period number, incident angle corresponding to s-polarized light and thickness of defect layer can be studied to obtain optimized values of these parameters under which our design possesses ultra-high sensitivity. After obtaining optimized values of theses parameters we have calculated QF, DL, SR, SNR, DR, DA, FOM and \({\sigma }_{peak}\) values of our structure for analyzing its overall performance. The average sensitivity of 4270.525928 nm/RIU can be achieved from our design. FOM, QF and DR values of proposed structure are high whereas DL is low of order 10 –6 . The idea of this manuscript may be very helpful for designing of photonic and plasmonic biosensors.
