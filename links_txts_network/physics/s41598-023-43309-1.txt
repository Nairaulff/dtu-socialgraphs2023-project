Introduction Alumina or aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) is one of the ceramic materials and is used in a wide range of applications such as catalysts, adsorbent, transparent armor for ballistic instrument, discharge lamps, laser, infrared (IR) airborne sensors 1 . There are many forms of Al 2 O 3 (α, κ, γ, β, θ, χ, δ, ή) 2 . Due to its stable thermodynamics, it is considered α-Alumina Oxide (α-Al 2 O 3 /corundum) one of the most important phase, α-Al 2 O 3 has a variety of applications, including ceramic, high-strength materials, transparent armor for ballistic performance, catalysts, catalyst support, adsorbents, and electronic matching like high-performance Field Effect Transistors (FETs), optoelectronics, electrical insulators, thermoluminescent dosimeters, light-emitting display, cutting tools, lasers, spark plugs, and gas sensor 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 . α-Al 2 O 3 is formed at temperatures above 1100 °C, with a hexagonal crystalline structure and lattice parameters a = 4.758 Å and c = 12.991 Å 6 , 7 . (α-Al 2 O 3 ) has direct energy transition and energy gap (E g ) 4.116 eV 5 8.8 eV 8 . Vanaduim oxide phases include V 2 O 5 , VO 2 , V 2 O 3 , and multiphase V x O y . Among all vanadium oxides (V 2 O 5 ) is the most stable and has a high oxidation state. Due to their unique structural properties, vanadium oxide-based materials have attracted a lot of attention recently for applications such as solar cells, gas sensors, optical-electrical switches, chemical sensing and electrochromic device optoelectronic devices 9 . Vanadium oxides (V 2 O 5 ) has direct energy gap (Eg = 2.2–2.8 eV), an orthorhombic and tetragonal crystalline structure and lattice parameters a = 3.561 Å, b = 11.501 Å, c = 4.378 Å 5 , 10 . Copper oxide (CuO) is p-type semiconductor with smallest energy gap (Eg = 1.2–1.9) eV, with monoclinic crystalline structure and lattice parameters a = 4.69 Å, b = 3.42 Å, c = 5.13 Å 11 . There are many studies that prepared pure α-Al 2 O 3 and doped with some metallic elements, but the prepartion of pure α-Al 2 O 3 as nanocomposite with copper oxide or vanaduim oxide was scarce,and from this point we sought to prepare pure α-Al 2 O 3 , α-,Al 2 O 3 /CuO(AC) and α-Al 2 O 3 /V 2 O 5 (AV) as a nanocomposite to improve the properties and search for its uses in many other applications. There are many methods used to prepare oxides as pure and nanocomposite materials, such as sol gel 5 , 6 hydrothermal 12 , Co 2 laser vaporization 2 , physical vapro deposition(PVD) 13 ….etc. The sol gel technique has been most used because it allows for low temperature synthesis, with excellent purity and simple control of the reaction conditions 6 . Experimental details Materials The materials that used in this work include: Aluminum nitrate Al(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O (HIMEDIA, 95%), Copper nitrate trihydrate Cu(NO 3 ) 2 .3H 2 O (HIMEDIA, 99%) and Ammonium Monovanadate (NH 4 VO 3 ) HIMEDIA, 99% and Ethanol C 2 H 5 OH (SEGMA, 96%). Experimental procedure Synthesis Synthesis pure α-Al 2 O 3 To prepare pure α-Al 2 O 3 , 15 g of aluminum nitrate (Al(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O) was dissolved in 40 ml of ethanol to obtain a 1 molar solution at room temperature by using magnetic stirrer for 20 min until became solution was homogeneous. Increasing the temperature to 80 °C and moving continuously for 20 min until became the gel by using a magnetic stirrer. The gel stayed in the beaker for 24 h, after that the gel dried in an oven at 180 °C for 2 h. Then grind until it a became soft powder, and put in the oven for 2 h at 1200 °C. Synthesis of samples To prepare the 0.8Al:0.2Cu (AC) sample, 12 g of aluminum nitrate (Al(NO 3 ) 3 ·9H 2 O) was dissolved in 40 ml of ethanol to obtain a 0.8 M solution, and 1.933 g copper nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO 3 ) 2 ·3H 2 O) was dissolved in 40 ml of ethanol to obtain a 0.1 molar solution. Each solution was stirred separately for 20 min at room temperature until each solution became homogeneous, then all solution were mixed with each other and stirred for 20 min at room temperature until it became homogeneous then stir the homogeneity solution for 20 min at 80 °C until gel formed, the gel stayed in the beaker for 24 h, after that it was dried in the oven at 180 °C for 2 h. Then grind until it a became soft powder. All the samples were put in oven for 2 h at 1200 °C, and left until 24 h for calcinations they were ready for diagnosis. The other samples were prepared in the same way. Also, all samples were made into pellets for electrical measurements. All the pellets were prepared with a pressing machine (Carver) under a pressure of 6000 kg (diameter (d) of pellet is 13 mm and the thickness (L) was 2 mm). Characterizations The structural properties of the samples were investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique using XD–2 X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation of λ = 0.154056 nm. The optical properties of the samples were investigated using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U3900 with software of Varian Cary 50). The electrical conductivity measurements of the prepared samples were carried out using (conductivity meter and 3540 PH). Results and discussion Structure properties XRD device was used to determine the crystal structure and crystallite size of the prepared samples. In the first sample XRD patterns of pure α-Al 2 O 3 was displayed as in Fig. 1 a. A number of diffraction peaks of α-Al 2 O 3 , were designated to (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), (018), (214) and (300) planes, which corresponding with 2θ (25.50, 35.20, 37.70, 43.30, 52.60, 57.460, 61.30, 66.50 and 68.20), respectively. The crystalline structure of α-Al 2 O 3 is hexagonal and space group: R-3c which agrees with the standard (JCPDS card, No. 00-46-1212) 5 , 7 , 14 , 15 , 16 . The high intensity of pure α-Al 2 O 3 for all almost peaks are observed. Figure 1 XRD patterns of α-Al2O3, AC and AV nanocompsite. Full size image In the second sample, XRD patterns showed a formed α-Al 2 O 3 , CuAlO 2 nanocomposite, as shown in Fig. 1 b. The intensity peaks of XRD patterns α-Al 2 O 3 were reduced, the reason behind the low intensity of α-Al 2 O 3 due to insert the impurity material of CuO leads to disorder in crystal regulation as well forming deformation for pure α-Al 2 O 3 . The new peaks of CuAlO 2 were at 2θ values (15.420, 31.50, 36.60, 42.220, 48.320) and (65.40) which are corresponding to (003), (006), (101), (104), (009) and (110) planes, respectively. Agree with standard (JCPDS card, No. 00-035-1401) 15 . The XRD pattern showed that the crystalline structure of CuAlO 2 was rhombohedra and (space group: R-3m). Occurrence the CuAlO 2 phase, in the structure due to the eutectic reaction of (Cu + and Cu 2 O) with Al 2 O 3 as the following 17 : $$ {\text{2CuO}} + {\text{H}}_{{2}} \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{{{\text{Heated}} }} {\text{Cu}}_{{2}} {\text{O }} + {\text{H}}_{{2}} {\text{O}} $$ $$ {\text{Cu}}_{{2}} {\text{O }} + {\text{Al}}_{{2}} {\text{O}}_{{3}} \mathop{\longrightarrow}\limits^{{{\text{Heated}}}} {\text{2CuAlO}}_{{2}} $$ In the third sample, XRD patterns shown α-Al 2 O 3 , V 2 O 5 nanocomposite as shown in Fig. 1 c, the intenisity peaks of α-Al 2 O 3 were reduced,the reason behind of low intensity of α-Al 2 O 3 due to insert the impuity material of V 2 O 5 which lead to disorder in crystal regulation as well forming deformation for pure α-Al 2 O 3 . The new peaks at 2θ (12.1°, 26.2°, 27.8° and 28.8°) which are corresponding to (200), (330), (240) and (241) planes respectively, of tetragonal structure of V 2 O 5 card No (JCPDS card, No. 00-45-1074) 18 were observe. The average crystallite size (D) of the pure α-Al 2 O 3 , AC and AV nanocomposite were calculated by Debay–Scherrer equation Eq. ( 1 ) 19 , 20 . $$ {\text{D }} = \frac{{0.89{{ \lambda }}}}{{{\beta \text{COS}}\theta }} $$ (1) where λ (0.154 nm) represents the wave length of X-ray, θ indicates Bragg’s angle, and (β): the from full width at half maximum (FWHM). The result were shown as in Table 3 . The crystallite size of pure α-Al 2 O 3 was 43.1 nm. In the (AC) nanocomposite the crystallite size was decrease to 24.05 nm as shown in Table 3 . This is decreasing in crystallite size due to that the molar concenteration of Cu +1 implying in evolution of secondary phase controls the particle size of the parent phase (α-Al 2 O 3 ) 21 . The results which obtained of the crystallite size are in a good agree with 22 . In the (AV) sample, the crystllite size decrease to 34.84 nm, this decrease may be occur due to the ionic radius of the aluminum oxide (0.54 Å) less than ionic radius of vanadium oxide (0.59 Å). Also, the molar concenteration of V +5 implying that the evolution of secondary phase controls the particle size of the parent phase (α-Al 2 O 3 ), to some extent during crystallization 21 . The results were in a good agree with 23 , 24 . On the other hand, due to the importance of the dislocation density (δ) in the mechanical and structural properties, it was calculated using Eq. ( 2 ) 25 . $$ \delta \, = { 1 }/{\text{ D2}} $$ (2) All the results show in Table 2 . In addition, the lattice constants (a, b and c) were calculated 2 using the Eqs. ( 3 ) and ( 4 ). $$ \frac{{\text{1}}}{{{\text{d}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{\text{ = }}\frac{{{\text{h}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{{{\text{a}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{\text{ + }}\frac{{{\text{k}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{{{\text{b}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{\text{ + }}\frac{{{\text{l}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{{{\text{c}}^{{\text{2}}} }} $$ (3) $$ \frac{{\text{1}}}{{{\text{d}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{{ = }}\frac{{\text{1}}}{{{\text{sin}}^{{\text{2}}} {{\beta }}}}\left( {\frac{{{\text{h}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{{{\text{a}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{{ + }}\frac{{{\text{k}}^{{\text{2}}} {\text{sin}}^{{\text{2}}} {{\beta }}}}{{{\text{b}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{{ + }}\frac{{{\text{l}}^{{\text{2}}} }}{{{\text{c}}^{{\text{2}}} }} - \frac{{{{{\text 2hl cos}\beta }}}}{{{\text{ac}}}}} \right) $$ (4) The calculated lattice constants were in good agreement with the last studies 22 . The unit cell volume (V) and The strain (ε) calculated using the Eqs. ( 5 )–( 7 ) 26 , respectively. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2 . $$ {\text{V}} = \, 0.{\text{866\,\,a}}^{2}\, {\text{c}} $$ (5) $$ {\text{V}} = {{ \text abc\,\, sin }\beta} $$ (6) $$ {\varepsilon } = \frac{{{{ \beta {\text cos}\theta }}}}{4} $$ (7) Table 1 Structure properties of the pure α-Al 2 O 3 , AC and AV nanocomposite.

Full size table Optical properties Transmission The transmittance spectra of pure α-Al 2 O 3 , AC and AV nanocomposite was measured in the range 200–800 nm. The transmittance of pure α-Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles decreased as the wavelength increase, with the highest increased transmittance occurring at a wavelength of 320 nm, as shown in Fig. 2 . The transmittance of AC and AV nanocomposite also decreased, as the wavelength increased, with transmittance values of 92% and 94%, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3 . The increase in transmittance in the sample with added copper and vanadium can be attributed to the formation of new energy levels within the band gap of the α-Al 2 O 3 crystal lattice. When copper and vanadium ions are added to the α-Al 2 O 3 lattice, they introduce new energy levels that allow for the absorbed of light that allow for the absorbed by the crystal lattic, leading to an increase in transmittance. The exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is complex and depends on the specific properties of the added ions and their interaction with the α-Al 2 O 3 lattice. Ho wever, it is clear that the addition of copper and vanadium ions to the α-Al 2 O 3 crystal lattice can significantly alter its optical properties, leading to increased transmittance 16 .

Full size image Absorption The optical absorpation of the samples were determined at room temperature using the UV–visible spectrophotometer within wavelenghth rang of 200–800 nm. Figure 4 shows the relationship between the absorpation on the Y-axis and the wavelength on the X-axis of pure α-Al 2 O 3 , the highest point of the absorpation was at 204 nm, while the lowest value was at 310 nm, then the absorpation was increase slightly with increasing the wavelength. The wavelength absorption of pure α-Al 2 O 3 are observed at 280 nm 16 . The absorption of the AC and AV nanocomposites shown as in Fig. 5 . Inspectra the absorption edges are observed in the UV–Vis region as 314.8–344 nm for AC and AV nanocomposite, respectively. In these samples absorption bands are attributed to the photoexcitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. Further, the absorption bands are ascribed to the electronic transitions from occupied 2p bands ofoxygen to unoccupied 3d bands of copper and vanadium 27 . Figure 4 The absorption of pure α-Al 2 O 3 . Full size image Figure 5 The absorption of AC and AV nanocomposite. Full size image Optical band gap energy (E g ) The energy gap (E g ) was calculated by using the following equation 20 , 28 , 29 , 30 : $$ \alpha \user2{h\nu } = {\varvec{c}}_{1} \left( {\user2{h\nu } - {\varvec{E}}_{{\varvec{g}}} } \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \user2{ } $$ (8) where C 1 is a constant, h is the Planck constant and α is the optical absorption coefficient. The energy gap of pure α-Al 2 O 3 was 5.28 eV as shown in Fig. 6 . This result agree with 16 . While the energy gap of AC and AV were 3.7 and 3.47 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7 a and b. The addition of 20% Cu +1 and 20% V +1 , reduced the band gap in the nanocomposite. The decrease in the band gap value can be attributed to the appearance of the empty levels induced by defects located in the band gap 5 . It is a well-known that the band gap of any material is influenced by the concentration of defects. In α-Al 2 O 3 , both donor (oxygen vacancies) and acceptor defects (Al interstitials) create energy levels below the conduction band and above the valence band, respectively. The creation of energy levels can be explained by the Frenkel reaction for Al interstitial defects and the Schottky reaction for the oxygen vacancy defects 31 .

Full size image Electrical properties Current-voltag (I–V) measurments The ohmic resistance ( R ) of pure α-Al 2 O 3, AC and AV nanocomposites were calculated from the I–V curve according to ohm law Eq. ( 9 ) (ohm law) 32 . $$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$ (9) where (I) is the current and the (V) is the voltag. The electrical conductivity (σ d.c ) was calculated by using Eq. ( 10 ) 33 . $$ {\upsigma }_{d.c} = \frac{L}{RA} $$ (10) where L (Thiknecess), d (Diameter), r (Radius; r = d/2) and A (Area; A = л r 2 ). The conductivity of material is determined by the presence of free charge carriers, such as electrons or ions, that can move freely within the material 34 . In the case of pure α-Al 2 O 3 , there are no free charge carriers available, resulting in zero conductivity. When copper nitrate (Cu(NO3)2) is added to α-Al 2 O 3 , it introduces copper ions (Cu 2 + ) into the material. These copper ions can act as charge carriers and contribute to the conductivity of the material 35 . However, the conductivity is still weak because the conductivity is still weak because the concentration of copper ions is relatively low. Similarly, when copper nitrate NH 4 VO 3 is added to α-Al 2 O 3 , it introduces vanadium ions (V 5 + ) into the material. These copper ions can act as charge carriers and contribute to the conductivity. However, like with copper nitrate, the conductivity of vanaduim ions is relatively low, resulting in weak conductivity. It is important to note that both copperr and vanaduim are transition metals with partially filled d-orbitals in their electronic configurations. This allows them to easily donate or accept electrons and participate in charge transport within a mateial. The value obtained in this work for electrical conductivity(σ d.c ) is in agree with conventional value of σ d.c of semiconductors (10 4 –10 −9 Ω −1 cm −1 ) 36 , also is consistent with the average value of α-Al 2 O 3 (6.87 × 10 –12 ± 1.22 × 10 –14 Ω −1 cm −1 ) 37 , CuO (1.1 × 10 −4 and 2.77 × 10 –4 Ω −1 cm −1 ) 38 and V 2 O 5 (2.53 × 10 –4 Ω −1 cm −1 ) 39 , (2.48 × 10 −6 and 6.16 × 10 −8 Ω −1 cm −1 ) 40 . Ionic conductivity (σ ion ) The ionic conductivity σ ion of the elctrolyte was measured at room temperture.The ionic conductivity was found to be greater than the electrical conductivity, and this increase may be attributed to the contribution of charged carriers in the liquid, as shown in Table 3 . Table 3 Value R, σd.c and σion of pure α-Al 2 O 3 , AC and AV nanocomposite.
