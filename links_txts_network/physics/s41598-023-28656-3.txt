Introduction Mixed valency, the presence of more than one oxidation state for a particular chemical element, is associated with very rich physics, in both molecular and solid-state systems. It can be intrinsic, as for example in stoichiometric magnetite Fe 3 O 4 1 , or obtained through doping as in the colossal magneto-resistance manganese oxides ( R 1- x A x )MnO 3 ( R = rare-earth cation, A = alkali or alkaline-earth cation) 2 . It can also imply quasi-localized ligand-hole states, i. e., ligand mixed valency, as shown for underdoped cuprates 3 , 4 or for the spin-Peierls compound NaV 2 O 5 5 , 6 . Here we explore the mixed valence landscape in the molybdates GaMo 4 S 8 and GaMo 4 Se 8 , lacunar-spinel quantum magnets displaying remarkable properties, e. g., modulated cycloidal and Néel-type skyrmion-lattice states with sub-10 nm periodicity that are coupled to ferroelectric polarization 7 , a plethora of ferroelectric domain boundaries and junctions 8 , and a cluster spin-glass phase 9 . Using advanced wave-function-based quantum chemical computational schemes, we show that the peculiar interplay of electronic correlations and spin–orbit interactions in these materials sets the stage for interesting physics and new insights: the dressing of a j eff = 1/2 spin–orbit-coupled state 10 with virtual valence space excitations. This dressing, or correlation cloud, is evidenced with the help of wave-function analysis and of observables such as the ground-state g factors and branching ratios. The use of the latter as indicators for ground-state correlations is possible due to the presence of sizable spin–orbit interactions: in their absence, information can be obtained by comparing ab initio and experimental data for e. g. the cohesive energy 11 , 12 . The outcome of magnetization measurements performed on GaMo 4 S 8 supports the computational findings and calls for spectroscopic verification of other specific predictions we make, e. g., of N -particle excitation energies as probed by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering experiments. Results High-temperature electronic structure, dressed j eff = 1/2 states Spinels are generically described by the chemical formula AM 2 X 4 . The M sites define a pyrochlore lattice, each of those ions being encapsulated within an X 6 octahedral cage of nearest-neighbor chalcogenide ligands. Magnetite, for example, belongs to this class of systems, with Fe ions at both A and M sites 1 . In lacunar spinels, the A sites have half-integer occupation. With every second A cation removed, nearest-neighbor M 4 tetrahedra of the initial pyrochlore structure experience different surroundings; structural relaxation in the new setting yields a so called “breathing” pyrochlore lattice. The simplest way of representing that is as a fcc network of M 4 clusters (or of M 4 X 16 units), see Fig. 1 a; adjacent M 4 entities share no M site. Figure 1 GaMo 4 X 8 cluster model and molecular orbital schemes. ( a ) GaMo 4 S 8 /GaMo 4 Se 8 cluster model. Mo 4 tetrahedra are shown in green. Small atomic spheres indicate capped effective core potentials (cECPs). (Ga: blue, Mo: green, S/Se: yellow). ( b ) Molecular-orbital diagram for the Mo 4 cluster in high-temperature, cubic T d point group with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) and low-temperature, rhombohedral C 3v symmetry as a result of Jahn–Teller (JT) distortion. Full size image Prior electronic-structure calculations based on density functional theory 13 , 14 point to a single-tetramer molecular-orbital-like diagram with a set of a 1 , e , and t 2 levels at the top of the occupied orbital space, where the notations correspond to T d point-group symmetry (see Fig. 1 b). In GaMo 4 S 8 and GaMo 4 Se 8 there are formally 2.75 electrons per transition-metal (TM) site (i. e., 4 × 2.75 = 11 d electrons per Mo 4 cluster). Since the t 2 levels come at higher energy as compared to the a 1 and e components, the basic single-tetrahedron electronic structure in GaMo 4 X 8 would then imply filled a 1 and e states and one hole within the t 2 sector. However, given the results of state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations on related “clustered” compounds, both d- 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 and p-electron 19 based, there are reasons to believe that the picture presently put forward for the single-tetramer electronic structure in GaMo 4 X 8 is somewhat too sketchy. For insights into the correlated electronic structure of Mo 4 13+ units in GaMo 4 S 8 and GaMo 4 Se 8 , we adopt the embedded-cluster quantum chemical approach described in Ref. 18 and the lattice parameters and atomic positions determined by Powell et al . for GaMo 4 S 8 20 and Routledge et al . for GaMo 4 Se 8 21 . An [Mo 4 X 16 ] 19- cluster was in each case embedded within a large array of point charges created with the Ewald program 22 , 23 ; capped effective core potentials (cECPs) were assigned to the 98 closest atoms. Further details on the embedding procedure are provided in the Supplemental Material ( SM-1 ). The more general theoretical frame is mapped in Refs. 11 , 24 . The nature of the ground state and the low-energy excitation spectrum of a Mo 4 tetrahedron were first analyzed for the high-temperature (HT) structure, in both GaMo 4 S 8 and GaMo 4 Se 8 . The leading ground-state configuration is a 1 2 e 4 t 2 5 t 1 0 t 2 0 (c.f. Figure 1 b), but for a “converged” CAS(11e,12o) orbital space it comes with a weight of only 62% in the CASSCF ground-state wave-function (see Supplemental Material SM-3 for the active space orbitals and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 in Supplemental Material SM-4 for the excited state configurations). The remaining configurations are mostly double excitations, e. g., a 1 2 e 3 t 2 4 t 1 1 t 2 1 ; there is a multitude of those, each contributing to the overall wave-function with a weight of less than 5%. These findings do not seem unusual for this class of materials: important multiconfigurational effects, i. e., a weight of the a 1 2 e 4 t 2 1 leading electron configuration of less than 70%, were also found in the related 4 d lacunar spinel GaNb 4 Se 8 18 . The competition between different electronic configurations seems to be even sharper in the vanadium analogue 17 , 25 . Spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is effective for the multiconfigurational 2 T 2 ground-state, giving rise to a low-lying spin–orbit doublet and a spin–orbit quartet with an excitation energy of about 0.12 eV (see Figs. 1 b, 2 ). Yet, different from the (… a 1 2 e 4 ) t 2 5 leading ground state configuration, unambiguously described in terms of S = 1, L eff = 1/2, and j eff = 1/2 quantum numbers 10 , the multiconfigurational case entails more subtle nuances. This is discussed in the following paragraphs. Figure 2 Low-energy excitation energies for high-temperature GaMo 4 S 8 . The spectrum was calculated using an [Mo 4 S 16 ] 19- embedded cluster model (CAS(11e,12o)). Both CASSCF and NEVPT2 values (also with SOC for the latter) are given in eV. Four quartets and six doublets were included in the state-averaging procedure. Notations according to T d point group symmetry are used. Full size image As depicted in Fig. 2 , further excited states follow at energies exceeding 1 eV. Different from the ground 2 T 2 term, spin–orbit interactions play a less important role for the higher-lying multiplets. But noticeable modifications occur post-CASSCF for the latter, at the NEVPT2 level; the sequence of the 4 A 2 and 2 A 1 terms, for instance, is different in NEVPT2 as compared to CASSCF. Comparing the NEVPT2 energies in GaMo 4 S 8 and GaMo 4 Se 8 (see Supplementary Material SM-4 ), it is seen that the excitation spectra are rather similar, somewhat scaled down in the latter compound. This can be attributed to having longer Mo-Se bonds in GaMo 4 Se 8 , i. e., weaker ligand fields. To quantify the strength of spin–orbit interactions, the SOC constant λ was determined from minimal active space calculations. For such a CAS(5e,3o), which only incorporates the (… a 1 2 e 4 ) t 2 5 configuration, the j eff = 3/2 quartet is split by 100 meV from the j eff = 1/2 ground-state term, yielding a SOC constant \(\lambda_{{{\text{SOC}}}}^{{{\text{Mo}}_{4} }} = 67\; {\text{meV}} = 538\;{\text{ cm}}^{ - 1}\) . This value lies close to the SOC constant estimated for the (… a 1 2 e 4 ) t 2 1 compound GaNb 4 Se 8 , \(\lambda_{{{\text{SOC}}}}^{{{\text{Nb}}_{4} }} = 516 \;{\text{cm}}^{ - 1}\) 18 . Compared to a Mo + single-ion value \(\lambda_{{{\text{SOC}}}}^{{{\text{Mo}}^{ + } }} = 630 \;{\text{cm}}^{ - 1}\) 10 , the SOC parameter is lower in GaMo 4 Se 8 , due to the more delocalized character of lacunar-spinel t 2 electrons – those orbit in lacunar spinels a four-site unit, not a single TM ion. The fact that the splitting between the lowest spin–orbit states increases when using larger active spaces (from 0.1 to 0.12 eV, see Fig. 2 ) has to do with electron correlations that bring in multiconfigurational physics; such effects were not addressed in earlier computations based on density functional theory 14 , 26 . A peculiar feature of nominal j eff = 1/2 ground states is free-electron-like g factors 10 , even if L eff = 1. On the basis of the active space employed for the calculations [i. e., CAS(11e,12o)], ground-state g factors of 2.18 are obtained. The sizable deviation from 2 has to do with contributions of other electron configurations to the multiconfigurational ground-state wave-function, i. e., dressing with intra-tetramer excitations. For comparison, magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate a g value of 2.37 (see Supplementary Material SM-5 ). The somewhat larger experimental estimations hint towards additional vibronic effects 27 , 28 not included in the rigid cluster model. Another quantity that can provide evidence for such dressing is the branching ratio (BR) in L -edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), i. e., the ratio of the integrated intensities of the L 3 and L 2 absorption edges. It is directly related to the ground-state expectation value \({\mathcal{Z}}\) of the spin–orbit Hamiltonian and can be compactly expressed as \({\text{BR}} = \left( {2 + r} \right)/\left( {1 - r} \right)\) 29 , 30 , 31 , where \(r = {\mathcal{Z}}/n_{{\text{h}}}\) , \(n_{{\text{h}}}\) is the number of holes in the valence shell, and for a given LS term \({\mathcal{Z}} = \lambda^{ - 1} {\mathcal{H}}_{{{\text{SO}}}} = {\mathbf{L}} \cdot {\mathbf{S}}\) . \({\mathcal{Z}}\) can be alternatively written as 30 , 31 , 32 $${\mathcal{Z}} = \lambda^{ - 1} \left( {E_{{{\text{LS}}}}^{0} - E_{{{\text{LSJ}}}}^{0} } \right),$$ (1) where \(E_{{{\text{LS}}}}^{0}\) and \(E_{{{\text{LSJ}}}}^{0}\) are ground-state eigenvalues without and with SOC, respectively. \(E_{{{\text{LSJ}}}}^{0}\) may depend on both first- and second-order SOCs. As an example, for a nominal j eff = 1/2 spin–orbit ground state in t 2g 5 iridates 33 , 34 ( \(n_{{\text{h}}} = 5\) ), values \({\mathcal{Z}}\) = 1 and BR = 2.75 are expected 35 , 36 ; in contrast, for vanishing valence-shell spin–orbit interactions, \({\mathcal{Z}}\) → 0 and BR → 2 are obtained. For the lacunar-spinel molybdates, using the minimal active space in the CASSCF calculation (five electrons within the three t 2 cluster orbitals), we find indeed \({\mathcal{Z}}\) = 1 (see Table 1 , first line). Slight reduction of the NEVPT2 minimal-CAS \({\mathcal{Z}}\) to 0.99 indicates the admixture of other electron configurations in the NEVPT2 treatment. Proper description of multiconfigurational physics requires however larger active spaces: enlarging the active space to CAS(11e,12o), \({\mathcal{Z}}\) increases to 1.2–1.3, even when only the lowest-lying 2 T 2 term is included in the spin–orbit part of the computation. The difference between the large-CAS \({\mathcal{Z}}\) , \(\approx\) 1.2, and the minimal-CAS \({\mathcal{Z}}\) of 1 is an indicator for the amount of dressing of the j eff = 1/2 object with intra-tetramer electronic excitations. Interestingly, while in e. g. t 2g 5 iridates or rhodates this difference mainly arises from strong second-order SOCs 32 , 35 , 36 , here those are inactive at HTs. \({\mathcal{Z}}\) being smaller and \(n_{{\text{h}}}\) larger than in t 2g 5 iridates, the BR is expected to be less than \(\approx\) 2.5 in the molybdate lacunar spinels, which can be verified by XAS measurements. Table 1 \({\mathbf{\mathcal{Z}}}\) values in GaMo 4 S 8 and GaMo 4 Se 8 . Full size table Low-temperature electronic structure, \(\tilde{S}\) = 1/2 pseudo-spins At temperatures of about 50 K, the GaMo 4 X 8 lacunar spinels undergo a phase transition from cubic ( F \(\overline{4}3\) m) to rhombohedral ( R 3 m ) space group 13 , with compression of the [Mo 4 X 4 ] 5+ tetrahedra along the cubic [111] direction, i. e., along a line connecting opposite Mo and X vertices 13 , 37 , 38 . This polar distortion gives rise to axial magnetic anisotropy along [111]. The effects of structural distortions as reported by Powell et al . for GaMo 4 S 8 20 and by Routledge et al . for GaMo 4 Se 8 21 were analyzed on the basis of CASSCF + NEVPT2 computations and orbital active spaces as employed for the HT phase (see Fig. 3 for GaMo 4 S 8 and Supplementary Material SM-4 for GaMo 4 Se 8 ). Figure 3 Influence of Jahn–Teller distortion on the low-energy excitation spectrum of GaMo 4 S 8 . Both high-temperature (HT) and low-temperature (LT) energies are given for the [Mo 4 S 16 ] 19- cluster model (NEVPT2(11e,12o)), including SOC for the latter. Six quartets and ten doublets were included in the state-averaging procedure. Full size image Trigonal crystal-field splittings as large as 0.33 eV and 0.24 eV for GaMo 4 S 8 and GaMo 4 Se 8 , respectively, are found to occur within the t 2 manifold, as illustrated by the splitting of the HT ground 2 T 2 state into 2 A 1 and 2 E terms. Obviously, this renders the j eff = 1/2 picture inadequate. Yet, the effect of SOC is not negligible—three distinct Kramers doublets are found in the spin–orbit calculations, with relative NEVPT2 energies of 0, 0.32/0.23, and 0.38/0.29 eV. From a magnetic point of view, the pertinent effective picture for the Mo 4 tetrahedra is therefore that of \(\tilde{S}\) = 1/2 moments with significant angular-momentum contribution, in accordance with susceptibility measurements 39 . This is further seen in the structure of the ab initio low- T (LT) g factors (Table 2 ), where \(g_{||}\) and \(g_{ \bot }\) refer to directions parallel and perpendicular to the rhombohedral axis (the [111] axis in cubic setting), respectively. A similar relation, \(g_{||} < g_{ \bot }\) , was found for positive trigonal/tetragonal splittings in RuCl 3 40 and Ba 2 IrO 4 32 , 41 . Table 2 Calculated g factors for LT [Mo 4 X 16 ] 19- ( X = S, Se) cluster models (CAS(11e,12o)). Full size table In order to experimentally verify the predicted type of axial anisotropy, characterized by \(g_{||} /{\text{g}}_{ \bot } < 1\) , we measured the magnetization of LT GaMo 4 S 8 along two non-equivalent directions, the [110] and [100] axes shown in Fig. 4 . The [110] direction is perpendicular to the [111] rhombohedral axis, hence the corresponding saturation magnetization directly yields \({g}_{ \bot }^{{{\text{exp}}}}\) . Measurements with field applied along the [100] axis yield a combination of g factors, namely \(\sqrt {g_{||}^{2} \cos^{2} \left( {54.7^\circ } \right) + g_{ \bot }^{2} \sin^{2} \left( {54.7^\circ } \right)}\) . Below 2 T, the low-temperature phase of GaMo 4 S 8 shows a sequence of meta-magnetic transitions between different modulated magnetic states, including the skyrmionic lattice state 7 , which is evidenced by anomalies in this region. These magnetic states are not the focus of the present work; instead, we study the high-field magnetization, with special emphasis on the anisotropy of the saturation magnetization μ sat . That allows us to determine the anisotropy of the g tensor. For both field directions, the measured magnetization is clearly saturated above ≈6 T. We find a tiny (≈1%) decrease of the magnetization at higher fields, originating from a small diamagnetic contribution of the sample holder. This is visible only when the magnetization of the crystal is fully saturated. Figure 4 Magnetization curves for LT GaMo 4 S 8 . Measured (thick full lines) and simulated (dashed lines) curves were obtained at a temperature of 2.5 K. [110] (red), [100] (blue), and [111] (black) directions are given in the cubic setting. The simulated curve is obtained for a [Mo 4 S 16 ] 19- embedded cluster (CASSCF(11e,12o)). Full size image For comparison, magnetization curves computed on the basis of the CASSCF(11e,12o) g factors 42 are also shown. At low fields between 1 and 4 T the simulated curves underestimate the measured magnetization, likely because of the single-tetrahedron model for which inter-tetrahedral magnetic interactions are absent. However, the experimental and simulated saturation magnetization values are in good agreement above 6 T, with \(\mu_{{{\text{sat}}}}^{{\left[ {110} \right]}} = 1.27 \mu_{{\text{B}}}\) and \(\mu_{{{\text{sat}}}}^{{\left[ {100} \right]}} = 1.12 \mu_{{\text{B}}}\) . Since our calculated values are fully ab initio (with no ad hoc parameters in the underlying theory), small deviations can be assigned to structural differences present in experiment and embedded-cluster computations (see Supplemental Material SM-6 ). Conclusions With the help of ab initio quantum chemical calculations for both high- and low-temperature structural configurations, we shed light onto the nature of magnetic moments in mixed valence GaMo 4 S 8 and GaMo 4 Se 8 . The quantum chemical computational data is referenced against low-temperature magnetization measurements. Our study documents the dressing of a bare j eff = 1/2 object 10 with valence space excitations. We analyzed in this regard the wave-function itself and observables such as the ground-state g factors and the so-called branching ratios. The essential physics refers to genuine electron correlation effects, different from the case of layered t 2g 5 iridium oxides 33 , 34 where the branching ratios and ground-state g factors deviate from values corresponding to nominal j eff = 1/2 moments due to j eff 1/2–3/2 mixing and second-order spin–orbit couplings in the presence of lower-symmetry crystal/ligand fields 32 , 41 . The dressing, or correlation cloud, evidenced here has to do with the ground state of a Mo 4 tetramer, different from the quasiparticle concept utilized for excitations in solids. Its internal degrees of freedom determine the polar properties of the material, although a comprehensive description requires additionally an adequate treatment of vibronic couplings and inter-tetramer interactions. Methods All calculations were performed with the Orca program package, v5.0 43 . Near-degeneracy correlation effects were accounted for by complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) theory 44 , 45 while additional dynamical correlations were described by N -electron valence second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2) 46 . In the framework of the Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) approximation 47 , the all-electron SARC-DKH-TZVPP 48 basis set for Mo and the DKH-DEF2-TZVPP 49 basis set for S/Se were used to treat SOC. To the cECPs, pseudopotentials of Andrae et al . 50 for Mo, Bergner et al . 51 and Leininger et al . 52 for Ga and S/Se were assigned. Additional computational details are given in the Supplemental Material ( SM-2 ). For direct connection with experimental results, the magnetization of a GaMo 4 S 8 single crystal grown by the flux method 53 was measured at 2.5 K in fields up to 14 T using a Quantum Design MPMS3.
