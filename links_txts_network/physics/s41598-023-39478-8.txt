Introduction Tan 1 creatively established the mathematical model of cobweb and fan resistor networks, according to this model, gave the incomparable analytical potential formula in theory. This is a breakthrough work, and its theoretical significance and application prospects are huge. As is well-known, classical physics is based on the analysis of physics mathematical models of physical processes. Computers have given physicists and engineers a new way to analyze and apply physical formulas and mathematical models that has revolutionized science and engineering outside the university. Everything changes if the computer is used to analyze and apply physical formulas and mathematical models. In addition, experts in engineering and scientific computing know that to improve the computational efficiency of the potential to help computational physicists and engineers solve major scientific and technical problems, it is a good idea to optimize the perfect analytical potential formula given in theory to improve the computational efficiency. In order to improve the calculation performance and scale of the formula. In this paper, based on the original potential formula, we re-represent it with the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class and the absolute value function, which improves the computational efficiency, and design the numerical algorithms can be used to the calculating potential for large-scale resistor networks. In the process of scientific development, many complex problems have arisen, which often require simple models to solve. According to the research results of resistor network model 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and neural network model 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , ideas can be obtained on many complex problems. In the past many years, through the research results of Green’s function, Laplace equation, Poisson equation, finite and infinite dimensional resistor network and Laplace matrix ( LM ) method and so on 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , the foundation of resistor network research has been laid. Shi et al. 12 , 13 studied a new discrete time recurrent neural network and its application to manipulators. Sun et al. 14 , 15 studied the theory and application of noise tolerance zeroing neural network. And Jin et al. 16 , 17 , 18 proposed a modified Zhang neural network ( MZNN ) model for the solution of time-varying quadratic programing ( TVQP ). In the past few years, Tan et al. 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 proposed a simpler recursive transformation ( RT ) method than LM method in the research of resistance network. It simplified the Laplacian matrix in two directions to the Laplacian matrix in one direction. In 2014, Tan et al. 37 solved the potential formula of spherical resistance network for the first time. Since 2015, Tan et al. 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 has studied the resistance network model by RT method. After 2020, Tan et al. 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 made more in-depth research on resistance network. Since RT method requires using a tridiagonal matrix to construct a mathematical model, and the analytical potential formula must be expressed by using the exact eigenvalues of this tridiagonal matrix. So the exact eigenvalues of the tridiagonal matrix need to be found. Tridiagonal matrices are used in many areas of science and engineering, and there are many good conclusions about it 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 . Figure 1 A \(8 \times 4\) cowbeb resistor network containing \(8 \times 4\) nodes and a zero potential point O . Full size image Figure 2 A \(10 \times 6\) fan resistor network containing \(10 \times 6\) nodes and a zero potential point O . Full size image In 2017, Tan 1 used RT - V method for the first time to study cobweb network and fan network. In Figs. 1 and 2 , the resistance on the warp and weft lines is \(r_{0}\) and r , where m and n are the scale of the resistor network, it contains m rows and n columns. Point \(O_{(0,0)}=0\) is defined as the origin of the resistor network. The potential formula \(U_{m\times n}(x, y )\) of any node d ( x , y ) in the \(m\times n\) cobweb network is shown as $$\begin{aligned} \frac{U_{m\times n}(x,y)}{J} = \frac{4r}{2m+1}\sum ^{m}_{i=1}\frac{g^{(i)}_{x_{1},x}S_{y_{1},i}-g^{(i)}_{x_{2},x} S_{y_{2},i}}{\lambda ^{n}_{i}+{{\bar{\lambda }}}^{n}_{i}-2}S_{y,i}, \end{aligned}$$ (1) $$\begin{aligned} g^{(i)}_{x_{s},x} = F_{n-|x_{s}-x|}+F_{|x_{s}-x|}. \end{aligned}$$ (2) The potential formula \(U_{m\times n}(x, y )\) of any node d ( x , y ) in the \(m\times n\) fan network is shown as $$\begin{aligned} \frac{U_{m\times n}(x,y)}{J} = \frac{4r}{2m+1}\sum ^{m}_{i=1}\frac{\beta ^{(i)}_{x_{1},x}S_{y_{1},i} -\beta ^{(i)}_{x_{2},x}S_{y_{2},i}}{(t_{i}-2)F^{(i)}_{n+1}}S_{y,i}, \end{aligned}$$ (3) $$\begin{aligned} \beta ^{(i)}_{x_{s},x} = \left\{ \begin{aligned} \Delta F^{(i)}_{x_s}\Delta F^{(i)}_{n-x} ~~if~x\ge x_s,\\ \Delta F^{(i)}_{x}\Delta F^{(i)}_{n-x_s} ~~if~x\le x_s, \end{aligned} \right. \end{aligned}$$ (4) where \(\theta _{i} = \frac{(2i-1)\pi }{(2m+1)},\ S_{y_k,i} = \sin (y_{k}\theta _{i})\) $$\begin{aligned} F^{(i)}_{k} = \frac{\lambda ^{k}_{i}-{\bar{\lambda }}^{k}_{i}}{\lambda _{i}-{\bar{\lambda }}_{i}}, \end{aligned}$$ (5) $$\begin{aligned}{}&\lambda _{i} = 1+h-h\cos \theta _{i}+\sqrt{(1+h-h\cos \theta _{i})^{2} - 1},\\&{\bar{\lambda }}_{i} = 1+h-h\cos \theta _{i}-\sqrt{(1+h-h\cos \theta _{i})^{2} - 1}, \end{aligned}$$ (6) $$\begin{aligned} t_{i} = 2+2h-2h\cos {\theta _i}, \end{aligned}$$ (7) the parameter \(h=\frac{r}{r_0}\) is defined. Novel formulas of potential represented by Chebyshev polynomials This section presents the re-expressed potential formulas ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) 1 of the resistor network. The potential formula expressed by the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class 62 can reduce the running time of computer simulation. Assume that the current J is input from \(d_{1}(x_{1}, y_{1})\) and output from \(d_{2}(x_{2}, y_{2})\) . The potential formula of any node d ( x , y ) in the \(m\times n\) cobweb resistor network is $$\begin{aligned} \frac{{\textbf{U}}_{m\times n}(x,y)}{J} = \frac{4r}{2m+1}\sum ^{m}_{\iota =1}\frac{\mu ^{(\iota )}_{x_{1},x}S_{y_{1},\iota } -\mu ^{(\iota )}_{x_{2},x}S_{y_{2},\iota }}{U^{(\iota )}_{n}-U^{(\iota )}_{n-2}-2}S_{y,\iota }, \end{aligned}$$ (8) where $$\begin{aligned} \mu ^{(\iota )}_{x_{s},x} = U^{(\iota )}_{n-|x_{s}-x|-1}+U^{(\iota )}_{|x_{s}-x|-1},~~ s = 1,~2. \end{aligned}$$ (9) The potential formula of any node d ( x , y ) in the \(m\times n\) fan resistor network is $$\begin{aligned} \frac{{\mathcal {U}}_{m\times n}(x,y)}{J} = \frac{4r}{2m+1}\sum ^{m}_{\iota =1}\frac{\varepsilon ^{(\iota )}_{x_{1},x}S_{y_{1},\iota } -\varepsilon ^{(\iota )}_{x_{2},x}S_{y_{2},\iota }}{(\omega _{\iota }-2)U^{(\iota )}_{n}}S_{y,\iota }, \end{aligned}$$ (10) where $$\begin{aligned} \varepsilon ^{(\iota )}_{x_{s},x}=({U^{(\iota )}_{-0.5}})^2(U^{(\iota )}_{n-|x_s-x|+1} -U^{(\iota )}_{n-|x_s-x|-1}+U^{(\iota )}_{n-x_s-x}-U^{(\iota )}_{n-x_s-x-2}),~~ s = 1,~2, \end{aligned}$$ (11) $$\begin{aligned} S_{y_k,\iota } = \sin (\frac{y_k(2\iota -1)\pi }{2m+1}),~~k=1,~2, \end{aligned}$$ (12) $$\begin{aligned} \omega _{\iota }=2+\frac{2r}{r_{0}}-\frac{2r}{r_{0}}\cos \frac{(2\iota -1)\pi }{2m+1}, \end{aligned}$$ (13) $$\begin{aligned} U^{(\iota )}_{\nu }= U^{(\iota )}_{\nu }(\cosh \phi _{\iota })= \frac{\sinh (\nu +1)\phi _{\iota }}{\sinh (\phi _{\iota })}, \cosh \phi _{\iota }=\frac{\omega _{\iota }}{2},~~\frac{\omega _{\iota }}{2}>1,~~\phi _{\iota }>0, \end{aligned}$$ (14) $$\begin{aligned} v=n-|x_s-x|-1,~|x_s-x|-1,~n-2,~n-|x_s-x|+1,~n-x_s-x,~n-x_s-x-2,~n,~-0.5,~~ s=1,~2,~~\iota =1,~2,\ldots ,~m. \end{aligned}$$ We set the node voltage at point \(O_{(0,0)}\) to 0, and the formula for calculating the potential of any node is described as $$\begin{aligned} {\textbf{U}}_{m\times n}(x,y) = {\textbf{V}}^{(y)}_{x},~{\mathcal {U}}_{m\times n}(x,y) = {\mathcal {V}}^{(y)}_{x},~V^{(0)}_{0}=0, \end{aligned}$$ (15) where \({\textbf{V}}^{(y)}_{x}\) and \({\mathcal {V}}^{(y)}_{x}\) are denoted by the node voltage of any node. Horadam sequence and discrete sine transform In this section, we introduce the explicit formula of Horadam sequence which is expressed by the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class and the sixth kind of discrete sine transform. A second-order recurrence sequence \({W_v}\) is called a Horadam sequence if $$\begin{aligned} W_v=dW_{v-1}-qW_{v-2},~~W_0=a,~~W_1=b, \end{aligned}$$ (16) where \(v\in {\textbf{N}},~~v\ge 2,~~a,~b,~d,~q\in {\mathbb {C}}\) , \({\textbf{N}}\) is set of all nonnegative integers and \({\mathbb{C}}\) is the set of all complex numbers. The explicit formula of Horadam sequence expressed by the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class is 63 $$\begin{aligned} W_{v} =(\sqrt{q})^v\left( \frac{b}{\sqrt{q}}U_{v-1}\left( \frac{d}{2\sqrt{q}}\right) - aU_{v-2}\left( \frac{d}{2\sqrt{q}}\right) \right) , \end{aligned}$$ (17) where \(U_{v}\) is the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class 62 , i.e. $$\begin{aligned} U_{v}=U_{v}(\cos \phi ) = \frac{\sin (v+1)\phi }{\sin \phi },~~\cos \phi =\frac{d}{2\sqrt{q}},~~\phi \in {\mathbb {C}}. \end{aligned}$$ (18) If \(\frac{d}{2\sqrt{q}} >1\) , the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class is re-described by hyperbolic functions, then Eq. ( 18 ) is transformed into $$\begin{aligned} U_{v}=U_{v}(\cosh \phi ) = \frac{\sinh (v+1)\phi }{\sinh \phi },~~\cosh \phi =\frac{d}{2\sqrt{q}},~~\phi \in {\mathbb {R}}, \end{aligned}$$ (19) where \({\mathbb {R}}\) is the set of all real numbers. First, we will present the derivation of Eq. ( 5 ) represented by the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class. Remark 1 It can be obtained from Eq. ( 6 ) that \(\lambda _{\iota }+{\bar{\lambda }}_{\iota }=\omega _{\iota }\) and \(\lambda _{\iota }\cdot {\bar{\lambda }}_{\iota }=1\) . Adding these conditions to Eq. ( 16 ), we get the following special Horadam sequence $$\begin{aligned} F^{(\iota )}_v=\omega _{\iota }F^{(\iota )}_{v-1}-F^{(\iota )}_{v-2}, ~~F^{(\iota )}_{0}=0,~~F^{(\iota )}_{1}=1, \end{aligned}$$ (20) where \(d=\omega _{\iota }>2,~~q=1\) , \(F^{(\iota )}_{v}\) and \(\omega _{\iota }\) are expressed in Eqs. ( 5 ) and ( 13 ), respectively. By replacing the expression of Eq. ( 5 ), with the results of Eq. ( 19 ), we have $$\begin{aligned} F^{(\iota )}_v = \frac{ \lambda ^{v}_{\iota }-{\bar{\lambda }}^{v}_{\iota }}{\lambda _{\iota } -{\bar{\lambda }}_{\iota }}=U^{(\iota )}_{v-1}(\frac{\omega _{\iota }}{2}). \end{aligned}$$ (21) Secondly, we will give the derivation of \(\lambda ^{n}_{\iota }+{\bar{\lambda }}^{n}_{\iota }\) expressed by the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class. Remark 2 Let $$\begin{aligned} B^{(\iota )}_{n}=\lambda ^{n}_{\iota }+{\bar{\lambda }}^{n}_{\iota }, \end{aligned}$$ (22) where \(B^{(\iota )}_{0}=2,\ B^{(\iota )}_{1}=\omega _{\iota }\) . Then the recursive relation of \(B^{(\iota )}_{n}\) is expressed as $$\begin{aligned} B^{(\iota )}_{n}=\omega _{\iota }B^{(\iota )}_{n-1}-B^{(\iota )}_{n-2},~~B^{(\iota )}_{0}=2,~ B^{(\iota )}_{1}=\omega _{\iota }, \end{aligned}$$ (23) where \(d=\omega _{\iota },\ q=1\) , \(\omega _{\iota }\) and \(B^{(\iota )}_{n}\) are expressed in Eqs. ( 13 ) and ( 22 ), respectively. By Eqs. ( 17 ) and ( 19 ), \(B^{(\iota )}_{n}\) is represented as follows $$\begin{aligned} B^{(\iota )}_{n}=\lambda ^{n}_{\iota }+{\bar{\lambda }}^{n}_{\iota } =\omega _{\iota }U_{n-1}(\frac{\omega _{\iota }}{2})-2U_{n-2}(\frac{\omega _{\iota }}{2}) =U_{n}(\frac{\omega _{\iota }}{2})-U_{n-2}(\frac{\omega _{\iota }}{2}). \end{aligned}$$ (24) Next, we will show the derivation of replacing Eq. ( 4 ) in terms of piecewise functions with Eq. ( 11 ) in terms of absolute value functions. Remark 3 For Eq. ( 4 ), when \(x\ge x_s\) $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \beta ^{(\iota)}_{x_{s},x}=\,&(F^{(\iota )}_{x_s+1}-F^{(\iota )}_{x_s})(F^{(\iota )}_{n-x+1}-F^{(\iota )}_{n-x})\\ =&\left( \frac{\lambda ^{n-x+x_s+2}_{\iota }+{\bar{\lambda }}^{n-x+x_s+2}_{\iota }-\lambda ^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }-{\bar{\lambda }}^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}-\frac{\lambda ^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota } -\lambda ^{n-x+x_s}_{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }^{n-x+x_s}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\right) \\&+\left( \frac{\lambda ^{n-x-x_s+1}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x-x_s+1}_{\iota }-\lambda ^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}-\frac{\lambda ^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }-\lambda ^{n-x-x_s-1}_{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }^{n-x-x_s-1}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\right) \\ =&\left( \frac{(\lambda _{\iota }-1)\lambda ^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }+(\bar{\lambda }_{\iota }-1)\bar{\lambda }^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }-(1-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })\lambda ^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }-(1-\lambda _{\iota })\bar{\lambda }^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\right) \\&+\left( \frac{(\lambda _{\iota }-1)\lambda ^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }+(\bar{\lambda }_{\iota }-1)\bar{\lambda }^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }-(1-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })\lambda ^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }-(1-\lambda _{\iota })\bar{\lambda }^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\right) \\ =\,&\frac{(\lambda _{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }_{\iota }-2)(\lambda ^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }+\lambda ^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota })}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\\ =\,&\frac{(\lambda ^{0.5}_{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }^{0.5}_{\iota })^2}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\left( \lambda ^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x+x_s+1}_{\iota }+\lambda ^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x-x_s}_{\iota }\right) \\ =\,&({F^{(\iota )}_{0.5}})^2(F^{(\iota )}_{n-(x-x_s)+2}-F^{(\iota )}_{n-(x-x_s)}+F^{(\iota )}_{n-x-x_s+1}-F^{(\iota )}_{n-x-x_s-1}). \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (25) Similarly, when \(x\le x_s\) $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \beta ^{(\iota)}_{x_{s},x}=&(F^{(\iota )}_{x+1}-F^{(\iota )}_{x})(F^{(\iota )}_{n-x_s+1}-F^{(\iota )}_{n-x_s})\\ =&\left( \frac{\lambda ^{n-x_s+x+2}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s+x+2}_{\iota }-\lambda ^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}-\frac{\lambda ^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }-\lambda ^{n-x_s+x}_{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s+x}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\right) \\&+\left( \frac{\lambda ^{n-x_s-x+1}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s-x+1}_{\iota }-\lambda ^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}-\frac{\lambda ^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota }-\lambda ^{n-x_s-x-1}_{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s-x-1}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\right) \\ =&\left( \frac{(\lambda _{\iota }-1)\lambda ^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }+(\bar{\lambda }_{\iota }-1)\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }-(1-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })\lambda ^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }-(1-\lambda _{\iota })\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\right) \\&+\left( \frac{(\lambda _{\iota }-1)\lambda ^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota }+(\bar{\lambda }_{\iota }-1)\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota }-(1-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })\lambda ^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota }-(1-\lambda _{\iota })\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota }}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\right) \\ =&\frac{(\lambda _{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }_{\iota }-2)(\lambda ^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }+\lambda ^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota })}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}\\ =&\frac{(\lambda ^{0.5}_{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }^{0.5}_{\iota })^2}{(\lambda _{\iota }-\bar{\lambda }_{\iota })^2}(\lambda ^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s+x+1}_{\iota }+\lambda ^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota }+\bar{\lambda }^{n-x_s-x}_{\iota })\\ =&({F^{(\iota )}_{0.5}})^2(F^{(\iota )}_{n-(x_s-x)+2}-F^{(\iota )}_{n-(x_s-x)}+F^{(\iota )}_{n-x_s-x+1}-F^{(\iota )}_{n-x_s-x-1}). \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (26) Combining Eqs. ( 25 ) and ( 26 ), Eq. ( 4 ) is re-expressed by the absolute value functions as $$\begin{aligned} \beta ^{(i)}_{x_{s},x}=({F^{(\iota )}_{0.5}})^2(F^{(\iota )}_{n-|x_s-x|+2} -F^{(\iota )}_{n-|x_s-x|}+F^{(\iota )}_{n-x_s-x+1}-F^{(\iota )}_{n-x_s-x-1}),~~ s = 1,~2, \end{aligned}$$ (27) By Eqs. ( 21 ), ( 27 ) and ( 11 ) in terms of the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class and absolute value function is obtained. Using Eqs. ( 19 ), ( 21 ) and ( 24 ), the potential formulas ( 8 ) and ( 10 ) are obtained. In order to achieve the fast calculation of numerical simulation, we utilize the sixth kind of discrete sine transform to diagonalize the perturbed tridiagonal matrix \({\textbf{A}}_m\) 1 . $$\begin{aligned} {\textbf{A}}_{m}= \left( \begin{array}{cccccc} 2+2h &{} -h &{} 0&{} \cdots &{} 0\\ -h &{} 2+2h &{} -h &{} \ddots &{} \vdots \\ 0 &{} \ddots &{} \ddots &{} \ddots &{} 0 \\ \vdots &{} \ddots &{} -h &{} 2+2h &{} -h\\ 0 &{} \cdots &{} 0 &{} -h &{} 2+h \end{array} \right) _{m\times m}, \end{aligned}$$ (28) where \(h = \frac{r}{r_0}\) . The eigenvectors \(\omega _1,\ldots ,\omega _m\) of matrix \({\textbf{A}}_{m}\) are expressed as $$\begin{aligned} \omega _\iota =2+2h-2h\cos \frac{(2\iota -1)\pi }{2m+1}),~~\iota =1,~2,\ldots ,~m, \end{aligned}$$ (29) and the corresponding eigenvectors \(\mathbb {\alpha }^{(j)}=(\alpha ^{(j)}_1,\alpha ^{(j)}_2 ,\ldots ,\alpha ^{(j)}_m)^T\) are expressed as $$\begin{aligned} \alpha ^{(j)}_k=\frac{2}{\sqrt{2m+1}}\sin \frac{(2j-1)k\pi }{2m+1}, ~~k=1,~2,\ldots ,~m,~~j=1,~2,\ldots ,~m. \end{aligned}$$ (30) As is known to all, if the orthogonal matrix \({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI}\) is the sixth kind of discrete sine transform ( DST - VI ) 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 , where $$\begin{aligned} {\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI}= \frac{2}{\sqrt{2m+1}}\left( \sin \frac{(2j-1)k\pi }{2m+1} \right) _{k,j=1}^m, \end{aligned}$$ (31) then $$\begin{aligned} ({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI})^{-1}=( {\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI})^T= {\mathbb {S}}_m^{VII}, \end{aligned}$$ (32) where \(( {\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI})^T\) is the transpose of the matrix \({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI}\) and \({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VII}\) is the seventh kind of discrete sine transform ( DST - VII ). The process of realizing the orthogonal diagonalization of matrix \({\textbf{A}}_{m}\) by \({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI}\) is as follows $$\begin{aligned} ({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI})^{-1}{\textbf{A}}_{m}({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI}) =\textrm{diag}(\omega _1,\omega _2,\ldots ,\omega _m), \end{aligned}$$ (33) i.e., $$\begin{aligned} {\textbf{A}}_{m}=({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI})\textrm{diag} (\omega _1,\omega _2,\ldots ,\omega _m)({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI})^{-1}, \end{aligned}$$ (34) where \(\omega _\iota\) is given by Eq. ( 29 ). By Kirchhoff’ s law and the node voltage, Tan 1 gave a matrix equation model as follows $$\begin{aligned} {\textbf{V}}_{v+1} = {\textbf{A}}_{m}{\textbf{V}}_{v} - {\textbf{V}}_{v-1} - r {\textbf{I}}_{v}, \end{aligned}$$ (35) where \({\textbf{A}}_{m}\) in Eq. ( 28 ), \({\textbf{V}}_{v}\) and \({\textbf{I}}_{v}\) are vectors of length \(m \times 1\) , in which \(\delta _{k,v}(v =k) = 1\) , \(\delta _{k,v}(v\ne k) = 0\) . $$\begin{aligned} {\textbf{V}}_{v} = [V^{(1)}_{v},V^{(2)}_{v},...V^{(m)}_{v}] ^{T}\ (0 \le v \le n), \end{aligned}$$ (36) $$\begin{aligned} I^{(\iota )}_{v}=J(\delta _{x_1,v}-\delta _{x_2,v}). \end{aligned}$$ (37) Since Eq. ( 35 ) cannot be directly calculated. Equation ( 35 ) is transformed by \({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI}\) method. The process of transformation is as follows. $$\begin{aligned} ({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI})^{-1}{\textbf{V}}_{v} =({\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI})^T{\textbf{V}}_{v} = {\textbf{C}}_{v},~~ {\textbf{V}}_{v} = {\mathbb {S}}_m^{VI}{\textbf{C}}_{v}, \end{aligned}$$ (38) where \({\textbf{C}}_{v}\) is also a \(m \times 1\) vector $$\begin{aligned} {\textbf{C}}_{v} = [c^{(1)}_{v},c^{(2)}_{v},...,c^{(m)}_{v}]^{T}~~(0 \le v \le n). \end{aligned}$$ (39) Remark 4 Tan 1 proposed the node voltage formula of the cobweb network as follows $$\begin{aligned} V^{(y)}_{k} = J\frac{4r}{2m+1}\sum ^{m}_{i=1}\frac{g^{(i)}_{x_{1},x}S_{y_{1},i} -g^{(i)}_{x_{2},x}S_{y_{2},i}}{\lambda ^{n}_{i}+{\bar{\lambda }}^{n}_{i}-2}\sin (y\theta _{i}), \end{aligned}$$ (40) where \(g^{(i)}_{x_{1},x}\) is expressed in Eq. ( 2 ), \(\lambda ^{n}_{i}\) and \({\bar{\lambda }}^{n}_{i}\) is in Eq. ( 6 ), \(\theta _{i} = \frac{(2i-1)\pi }{(2m+1)}\) , \(S_{y_k,i} = \sin (y_{k}\theta _{i}),~k=1,~2\) . According to Eqs. ( 2 ), ( 21 ), ( 24 ) and ( 40 ), we re-express the node voltage formula by the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class as follows $$\begin{aligned} {\textbf{V}}^{(y)}_{v} = J\frac{4r}{2m+1}\sum ^{m}_{\iota =1}\frac{\mu ^{(\iota )}_{x_{1},x}S_{y_{1},\iota } -\mu ^{(\iota )}_{x_{2},x}S_{y_{2},\iota }}{U^{(\iota )}_{n}-U^{(\iota )}_{n-2}-2}S_{y,\iota }, \end{aligned}$$ (41) where \(\mu ^{(\iota )}_{x_{s},x},~s = 1,~2\) is same as Eq.

Conclusion In this paper, based on the RT - V method, the accurate potential formulas of the \(m \times n\) cobweb resistor network and the \(m \times n\) fan resistor network 1 are improved. The potential formula is represented by the Chebyshev polynomial of the second class and the tridiagonal matrix is diagonalized by the DST - VI method, which realizes the high efficiency of the numerical simulation of the potential formula. The changes of variables in the potential formula are analyzed, and the corresponding three-dimensional view is drawn to show the influence of variable changes on the image. Then we design a fast algorithm for the resistor network potential to achieve fast calculation in the case of large-scale resistor networks. Finally, we show the calculation time of different calculation methods under different scale resistor networks, and the comparison shows the efficiency of the improved numerical simulation calculation.
