Introduction Many dynamical systems are commonly described using nonlinear evolution equations as models in a variety of scientific disciplines, notably fluid mechanics, plasma physics, solid-state physics, nonlinear optics, chemical kinematics, astrophysics, optical fiber, geochemistry, and chemical chemistry. To better understand the physical phenomena besides further applications in practical life, it is important to seek as many exact solutions as we can. Numerous important techniques, like the variational iteration method 1 , the sine-cosine technique 2 , the homotopy perturbation technique 3 , the first integral method 4 , the Bäcklund transformations 5 , the Jacobi elliptic function expansion procedure 6 , the \((G'/G)\) -expansion method 7 , the exponential function technique 8 , the Weierstrass elliptic function method 9 , the tanh function technique and its extensions 10 , the simplest equation technique 11 and the Lie group analysis method 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 have been developed during the past few decades to provide exact solutions as well as understand their features. In this study, the S-KdV equation is taken into account 16 $$\begin{aligned} U_{t}+U_{x}(\alpha _1 \sqrt{U}+\alpha _2 U)+\alpha _3 U_{xxx}=0. \end{aligned}$$ (1) where \(\alpha _1,~\alpha _2\) and \(\alpha _3\) are constants. Equation ( 1 ) is relevant to the study of ion-acoustic solitons in plasma physics when electron entrapment occurs. It also controls the electrostatic potential for a specific electron distribution in velocity space. Tagare and Chakraborti demonstrated in 17 using the direct integral approach that Eq. ( 1 ) has a single wave solution. Lee and Sakthivel provided some precise traveling wave solutions for Eq. ( 1 ) in 18 using the exp-function approach. A generalized KdV equation is an instance of Eq. ( 1 ) that has been examined in several situations arising in mathematical physics. Equation ( 1 ) turns into the Schamel equation for \(\alpha _2=0\) , $$\begin{aligned} U_{t}+U_{x}(\alpha _1 \sqrt{U})+\alpha _3 U_{xxx}=0. \end{aligned}$$ (2) Whereas Eq. ( 1 ) becomes a well-known KdV equation when \(\alpha _1=0\) $$\begin{aligned} U_{t}+\alpha _2 UU_{x}+\alpha _3 U_{xxx}=0, \end{aligned}$$ (3) that has been thoroughly examined by several authors. By using the transformation \(U(x,t)=w^{2}(x,t)\) . Then Eq. ( 1 ) can be written as $$\begin{aligned} 2ww_t +2\alpha _1 w^{2}w_x +2\alpha _2 w^{3}w_x+ 6\alpha _3 w_x w_{xx}+2\alpha _3 ww_{xxx}=0. \end{aligned}$$ (4) Here we study this equation from the point of view of Lie symmetry analysis. Our main concern is to discuss the optimal system for the S-KdV Eq. ( 4 ) and then to utilize it for symmetry reductions to obtain analytical solutions. Our findings will include periodic solutions, double periodic, shock waves, bell-shaped, and solitary waves. Lie symmetry method is a powerful method and is popular among recent techniques. This technique effectively deals with nonlinear PDEs. This method has been used for the study of vast nonlinear problems, especially the study of micromorphic model 19 , Riabouchinsky Proudman Johnson equation 20 , generalized Pochhammer–Chree equation 21 , the Benney–Luke equation 22 , Peyrard–Bishop model 23 and many others 24 , 25 . The literature for the Lie symmetry analysis is well documented and one can see 26 , 27 , 28 . This article is organized as follows: in “ Lie symmetries ”, we give the optimal system (one-dimensional) and the Lie symmetry analysis. Utilizing the optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras, we can produce the analytical solutions in “ Invariant solutions and symmetry reductions ”. In “ Generalized JEF method ” and “ A description of the MAE procedure ”, we examine solitary wave solutions based on trigonometric, hyperbolic, exponential, and rational function solitary solutions. “ Physical interpretations of the solutions ” addresses physical interpretation, and the conclusion follows. Lie symmetries Let us consider a one-parameter (local) Lie group of transformations ( \(\vartheta\) parameter) given by $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \tilde{x}\rightarrow x+\vartheta \varphi _{1}(x,t,w)+O(\vartheta ^{2}),\\ \tilde{t}\rightarrow t+\vartheta \varphi _{2}(x,t,w)+O(\vartheta ^{2}),\\ \tilde{w}\rightarrow w+\vartheta \eta (x,t,w)+O(\vartheta ^{2}). \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (5) The infinitesimal generator associated with the above transformations is $$\begin{aligned} \Sigma =\varphi _{1}(x,t,w)\frac{\partial }{\partial x}+\varphi _{2}(x,t,w)\frac{\partial }{\partial t}+\eta (x,t,w) \frac{\partial }{\partial w}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ (6) The coefficient functions \(\varphi _{1}, \varphi _{2}\) and \(\eta\) are to be found, and using the Lie invariance condition $$\begin{aligned} \Sigma ^{[3]}(\theta )|_{\theta =0}=0, \end{aligned}$$ (7) where \(\Sigma ^{[3]}\) is the third extension of \(\Sigma\) and $$\begin{aligned} \theta =2ww_t +2\alpha _1 w^{2}w_x +2\alpha _2 w^{3}w_x+ 6\alpha _3 w_x w_{xx}+2\alpha _3 ww_{xxx}. \end{aligned}$$ By solving the determining equations originating from Eq. ( 7 ), we can derive the symmetry generators of Eq. ( 4 ), Case-1 \((\alpha _1,\alpha _2 \ne 0)\) : $$\begin{aligned} \Sigma _1 =\frac{\partial }{\partial t},~ \Sigma _2 =\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ Case-2 \((\alpha _2 = 0)\) : $$\begin{aligned} \Sigma _1 =\frac{\partial }{\partial t},~ \Sigma _2 =\frac{\partial }{\partial x},~\Sigma _3 =x\frac{\partial }{\partial x}+3t\frac{\partial }{\partial t}-2w\frac{\partial }{\partial w}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ Case-3 \((\alpha _1 =0)\) : $$\begin{aligned} \Sigma _1 =\frac{\partial }{\partial t},~ \Sigma _2 =\frac{\partial }{\partial x},~\Sigma _3 =2\alpha _2 t\frac{\partial }{\partial x}+\frac{1}{w}\frac{\partial }{\partial w},~\Sigma _4 =x\frac{\partial }{\partial x}+3t\frac{\partial }{\partial t}-w\frac{\partial }{\partial w}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ One-dimensional optimal systems The idea of an optimal system of subalgebras for a certain Lie algebra to obtain fundamentally distinct invariant solutions was perhaps originally introduced by Ovsyannikov 27 . Then it was followed by Ibragimov 28 and continued by Olver 29 . To determine the optimal system, we identify the sets of equivalent classes of one-dimensional subalgebras by observing their behavior under the influence of the adjoint representation. The representation of the adjoint action can be expressed as, $$\begin{aligned} Ad(\exp {(\vartheta \Sigma _m )}\cdot \Sigma _n) = \Sigma _n -\vartheta [\Sigma _m, \Sigma _n ]+\frac{\vartheta ^{2}}{2!}[\Sigma _m,[\Sigma _m, \Sigma _n ]]-\cdots , \end{aligned}$$ (8) where \(\vartheta\) represents a real number and \([\Sigma _m , \Sigma _n ]\) indicates the Lie product defined by, $$\begin{aligned}{}[\Sigma _m, \Sigma _n ]=\Sigma _m \Sigma _n -\Sigma _n \Sigma _m. \end{aligned}$$ (9) Optimal system for Case-1 In this case, the algebra is two-dimensional and satisfies the commutation relation, $$\begin{aligned} {[}\Sigma _1,\Sigma _2 ]=0. \end{aligned}$$ We take into account following general element \(\Sigma\) of symmetry algebra \(\textrm{L}_{2}\) given by, $$\begin{aligned} \Sigma =\lambda _{1}\Sigma _1 +\lambda _{2}\Sigma _2. \end{aligned}$$ (10) When taking into account that the commutator relations are equal to zero, it becomes clear that the vector form cannot be further simplified. Case-I . \(\lambda _{2}= 0\) , so that $$\begin{aligned} \Sigma =\lambda _{1}\Sigma _1. \end{aligned}$$ (11) We get $$\begin{aligned} \mathcal {Q}_{1}=\Sigma _1, \end{aligned}$$ Case-II . \(\lambda _1 = 0,\lambda _{2}\ne 0\) , so that $$\begin{aligned} \Sigma =\lambda _{2}\Sigma _2. \end{aligned}$$ (12) We have $$\begin{aligned} \mathcal {Q}_{2}=\Sigma _2, \end{aligned}$$ Case-III . \(\lambda _1 \ne 0,\lambda _{2} \ne 0\) , so that $$\begin{aligned} \Sigma =\lambda _{1}\Sigma _1 +\lambda _{2}\Sigma _2. \end{aligned}$$ (13) We get $$\begin{aligned} \mathcal {Q}_{3}=\Sigma _1 +c \Sigma _2,\quad c \ne 0. \end{aligned}$$ Therefore, the set of symmetry subalgebras representing the optimal system can be described as follows $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \mathcal {Q}_1&=\Sigma _1,\\ \mathcal {Q}_2&=\Sigma _2,\\ \mathcal {Q}_3&=\Sigma _1 +c\Sigma _2,~~c\ne 0.\\ \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (14) Optimal system for Case-2 In this case, the algebra is three-dimensional with non-zero commutators, $$\begin{aligned} {[}\Sigma _1,\Sigma _3 ] =3\Sigma _1,~[\Sigma _2,\Sigma _3 ]=\Sigma _2. \end{aligned}$$ Table 1 displays the adjoint table, which assists us in calculating the optimal system of one-dimensional subalgebras.

Case-II. Consider \(\mathcal {Q}_2 =\Sigma _2\) . The associated Lagrange equation is $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dt}{0}=\frac{dx}{1}=\frac{dw}{0}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ We obtain the similarity variables \(w=\tau (\theta ), \theta =t\) . By using this transformation, it becomes possible to express the simplified version of Eq.

By using this transformation, it becomes possible to express the simplified version of Eq.

Case-III. Consider \(\mathcal {Q}_4 =\Sigma _1 +\Sigma _2\) . The associated Lagrange equation is $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dt}{1}=\frac{dx}{1}=\frac{dw}{0}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ We obtain the similarity variables \(w=\tau (\theta ), \theta =t-x\) . By using this transformation, it becomes possible to express the simplified version of Eq. ( 4 ) in the following manner $$\begin{aligned} -2\alpha _3 \tau \tau '''-2\tau '(\alpha _1 \tau ^{2}+3\alpha _3 \tau ''-\tau )=0. \end{aligned}$$ (44) This particular ODE cannot be solved using conventional analytical methods. Therefore, we recommend approaching it through numerical methods. Case-IV. Consider \(\mathcal {Q}_4 =\Sigma _1 -\Sigma _2\) . The associated Lagrange equation is $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dt}{1}=\frac{dx}{-1}=\frac{dw}{0}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ We obtain the similarity variables \(w=\tau (\theta ), \theta =t+x\) . By using this transformation, it becomes possible to express the simplified version of Eq. ( 4 ) in the following manner $$\begin{aligned} 2\alpha _3 \tau \tau '''+2\tau '(\alpha _1 \tau ^{2}+3\alpha _3 \tau ''+\tau )=0. \end{aligned}$$ (45) We propose solving this ODE using numerical methods. Symmetry reductions for Case-3 Case-I. Consider \(\mathcal {Q}_2 =\Sigma _2\) . The associated Lagrange equation is $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dt}{0}=\frac{dx}{1}=\frac{dw}{0}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ We obtain the similarity variables \(w=\tau (\theta ), \theta =t\) . By using this transformation, it becomes possible to express the simplified version of Eq. ( 4 ) in the following manner $$\begin{aligned} 2\tau \tau '=0. \end{aligned}$$ (46) Since, \(\tau \ne 0,\) this imples \(\tau '=0\) which gives \(\tau (\theta )=c_1.\) Hence, exact solution of ( 4 ) invariant under \(\Sigma _2\) is $$\begin{aligned} w(x,t)=c_1. \end{aligned}$$ (47) Case-II. Consider \(\mathcal {Q}_4 =\Sigma _3\) . The associated Lagrange equation is $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dt}{0}=\frac{dx}{2\alpha _2 t}=\frac{dw}{\frac{1}{w}}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ We obtain the similarity variables \(w=\frac{\sqrt{\alpha _2 t \tau (\theta )+x}}{\sqrt{\alpha _2}\sqrt{t}} , \theta =t\) . By using this transformation, it becomes possible to express the simplified version of Eq. ( 4 ) in the following manner $$\begin{aligned} \theta \tau '+\tau =0. \end{aligned}$$ (48) This gives, $$\begin{aligned} \tau (\theta )=\frac{c_1 }{\theta }\cdot \end{aligned}$$ (49) Hence, exact solution of ( 4 ) invariant under \(\Sigma _3\) is $$\begin{aligned} w(x,t)=\frac{\sqrt{\alpha _2 c_1 +x}}{\sqrt{\alpha _2}\sqrt{t}}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ (50) Case-III. Consider \(\mathcal {Q}_3 =\Sigma _1\) . The associated Lagrange equation is $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dt}{1}=\frac{dx}{0}=\frac{dw}{0}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ We obtain the similarity variables \(w=\tau (\theta ), \theta =x\) .

Consider \(\mathcal {Q}_5 =\Sigma _1 +\Sigma _3\) . The associated Lagrange equation is $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dt}{1}=\frac{dx}{2\alpha _2 t}=\frac{dw}{\frac{1}{w}}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ We obtain the similarity variables \(w=\sqrt{\tau (\theta )+2t} , ~\theta =t^{2}-\frac{x}{\alpha _2}\) . By using this transformation, it becomes possible to express the simplified version of Eq. ( 4 ) in the following manner $$\begin{aligned} \alpha _3 \tau '''{\alpha _2}^{3}(\tau \tau '-2)=0. \end{aligned}$$ (52) If \(\tau '''=0,\) this implies \(\tau (\theta )=\frac{c_1}{2}\theta ^{2}+c_2 \theta +c_3.\) So, the solution of ( 4 ) in main variables becomes $$\begin{aligned} w(x,t)=\sqrt{\frac{c_1}{2}\Big (t^{2}-\frac{x}{\alpha _2}\Big )^{2}+c_2 \Big (t^{2}-\frac{x}{\alpha _2}\Big ) +c_3 +2t}. \end{aligned}$$ (53) If \(\tau '''\ne 0\) , then \(\tau \tau '-2=0\) this gives \(\tau (\theta )=\sqrt{c_1 +4\theta }.\) Hence, the solution of ( 4 ) in main variables becomes $$\begin{aligned} w(x,t)=\sqrt{\sqrt{4\Big (t^{2}-\frac{x}{\alpha _2}\Big )}+c_1}. \end{aligned}$$ (54) Case-V. Consider \(\mathcal {Q}_5 =\Sigma _1 -\Sigma _3\) . The associated Lagrange equation is $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dt}{1}=\frac{dx}{-2\alpha _2 t}=\frac{dw}{-\frac{1}{w}}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ We obtain the similarity variables \(w=\sqrt{\tau (\theta )-2t} , ~\theta =t^{2}+\frac{x}{\alpha _2}\) . By using this transformation, it becomes possible to express the simplified version of Eq. ( 4 ) in the following manner $$\begin{aligned} \alpha _3 \tau '''+{\alpha _2}^{3}(\tau \tau '-2)=0. \end{aligned}$$ (55) In the next sections, we introduce some methods to deal with reduced ODEs arising in the reductions. Generalized JEF method In this section, we invoke the main steps for the generalized JEF method. This method is very efficient in generating periodic, double periodic, solitary wave, rational, and exponential function solutions. This method has a wide range of applications in engineering, biological sciences, chemical sciences, and mathematical physics. We briefly mention here the algorithm for the generalized JEF method. (Step 1): Consider a nonlinear PDE in the explicit form of the dependent variable $$\begin{aligned} X(w,w_{x},w_{t}, w_{xx},w_{xt},\ldots )=0. \end{aligned}$$ (56) (Step 2): We look for the transformation based on scaling and translation given by $$\begin{aligned} w(x,t)=\tau (\theta ),~\theta =x-V t. \end{aligned}$$ (57) In the above equation, the parameter V indicates the speed of the wave, and for the stationary solutions \(V=0\) . Note that Eq. ( 56 ) is invariant under the transformation ( 57 ) this usually works as an existence criterion for the waveform solutions. The transformation ( 57 ) reduces the number of independent variables in the nonlinear PDE ( 56 ) and turns it into an ODE of the form $$\begin{aligned} Y(\tau ,\tau ',\tau '',\ldots )=0. \end{aligned}$$ (58) This ODE ( 58 ) helps us to classify the waveform solutions of the nonlinear PDE ( 56 ). (Step 3): At this stage, we consider the general assumed solution for the ODE ( 58 ) as follows $$\begin{aligned} \tau (\theta )=\sum _{q=0}^{N}b_{q}S^q(\theta ). \end{aligned}$$ (59) In the equation provided, the constants \(b_q\) (where \(q=1, 2, \ldots , N\) ) represent coefficient values, and the function \(S(\theta )\) must fulfill the subsequent Jacobi elliptic equation $$\begin{aligned} S'(\theta )=\sqrt{a_1+a_2S^2(\theta )+\frac{a_3}{2}S^4(\theta )}, \end{aligned}$$ (60) the coefficients \(a_1,a_2\) and \(a_3\) are nonzero real parameters. The values of these parameters are listed in Table 3 . (Step 4): Subsequently, the balance principle is applied to determine the appropriate balancing number N . (Step 5): By solving the system described as \(S^q=0\) for all values of q , we obtain a collection of parameters. The subsequent relations are valid for the elliptic functions; $$\begin{aligned}{}&{\text {sn}}^{2}(\theta )+{\text {cn}}^{2}(\theta )=1,~{\text {dn}}^{2}(\theta )+\zeta ^{2}{\text {sn}}^{2}(\theta )=1, ~({\text {sn}}(\theta ))'={\text {cn}}(\theta ){\text {dn}}(\theta ), \\&({\text {cn}}(\theta ))'=-{\text {sn}}(\theta ){\text {dn}}(\theta ),~~({\text {dn}}(\theta ))'=-\zeta ^{2}{\text {sn}}(\theta ){\text {cn}}(\theta ). \end{aligned}$$ (61) Here we use \({\text {sn}}(\theta )={\text {sn}}(\theta |\zeta )\) . Trigonometric functions are typical of elliptic functions for \(\zeta \mapsto 0\) , whereas Table 4 shows examples of hyperbolic functions for \(\zeta \mapsto 1\) . Table 3 Types of solutions of ( 60 ). Full size table Table 4 When \(\zeta \mapsto 1\) . Full size table Periodic solutions of the S-KdV Eq. ( 4 ) By employing the balance principle to the ODE ( 40 ), we determine the balancing number to be \(N=1\) . Subsequently, the following assumed form arises from Eq. ( 58 ) $$\begin{aligned} S(\theta )=b_0+b_1 S(\theta ). \end{aligned}$$ (62) Continuing with step 5 of the algorithm mentioned earlier, we obtain $$\begin{aligned} c=c,~a_0=-\frac{21}{13}c,~a_1=a_1,~\alpha _2=\frac{65}{294c}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ (63) Therefore, Eq. ( 62 ) transforms into $$\begin{aligned} S(\theta )=-\frac{21}{13}c+b_1 S(\theta ). \end{aligned}$$ (64) Equation ( 64 ) results in a diverse range of solutions for the S-KdV Eq. ( 4 ), achieved by altering the parameters as outlined in Table 3 . Subcase: 1. When \(a_1=1,\,\,a_2=-(1+\zeta ^2),\,\,\,a_3=2\zeta ^2.\) For this case, we take \(S(\theta )= \text {sn}(\theta ,\zeta )\) to obtain periodic wave solutions of the Eq. ( 40 ); $$\begin{aligned} S(\theta )=-\frac{21}{13}c+b_1 {\text {sn}}(\theta ,\zeta ). \end{aligned}$$ (65) When \(\zeta\) is set to 1, Eq. ( 65 ) transforms into the solution corresponding to a shock wave $$\begin{aligned} S(\theta )=-\frac{21}{13}c+b_1\tanh (\theta ). \end{aligned}$$ (66) By applying the transformation ( 57 ), the solution for the S-KdV Eq.

(Step 3): At this stage, we proceed with the subsequently assumed solution for the ODE ( 58 ), $$\begin{aligned} \tau (\theta )=a_0+\sum _{\phi =1}^{N}\left[ a_\phi \left( \Pi ^\tau \right) ^\phi +b_\phi \left( \Pi ^{\tau }\right) ^{-\phi }\right] , \end{aligned}$$ (103) where \(\Pi\) , \(a_\phi\) , \(b_\phi\) , and \(a_0\) are arbitrary constants, and \(\tau (\theta )\) satisfies the auxiliary equation $$\begin{aligned} \tau ^{\prime }(\theta )=\frac{\Phi _{1}+ \Phi _{2} \Pi ^{-\tau }+ \Phi _{3} \Pi ^\tau }{\ln ( \Pi )}\cdot \end{aligned}$$ (104) In the above equation \(\Phi _1\) , \(\Phi _2\) , and \(\Phi _3\) are arbitrary constants and \(\Pi >0, \Pi \ne 1\) . The subsequent solution of the auxiliary Eq. ( 104 ) is presented, taking into consideration different cases. (Case i) If \(4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3}-\Phi _{3}^2<0, ~ \Phi _{3} \ne 0\) , then $$\begin{aligned} \Pi =\frac{-\Phi _{2} +\sqrt{4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3}-\Phi _{3}^2 } \tan \left( \frac{\sqrt{4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3}-\Phi _{3}^2 } \xi }{2}\right) }{2 \Phi _{3} } \quad \text{ or } \Pi =-\frac{\Phi _{2}+\sqrt{4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3}-\Phi _{3}^2} \cot \left( \frac{\sqrt{4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3}-\Phi _{3}^2 }\xi }{2}\right) }{2 \Phi _{3} } \end{aligned}$$ (Case ii) If \(\Phi _{2}^{2}-4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3} >0, ~ \Phi _{3} \ne 0\) , then $$\begin{aligned} \Pi =\frac{-\Phi _{2} +\sqrt{\Phi _{2}^{2}-4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3} } \tanh \left( \frac{\sqrt{\Phi _{2}^{2}-4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3} } \xi }{2}\right) }{2 \Phi _{3} } \quad \text{ or } \Pi =-\frac{\Phi _{2}+\sqrt{\Phi _{2}^{2}-4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3}} \coth \left( \frac{\sqrt{\Phi _{2}^{2}-4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3} } \xi }{2}\right) }{2 \Phi _{3} } \end{aligned}$$ (Case iii) If \(\Phi _{2}^{2}-4 \Phi _{1} \Phi _{3} =0\) , and \(\Phi _{3} \ne 0\) , then $$\begin{aligned} \Pi =-\frac{2+\delta \xi }{2\Phi _{3} \xi }\cdot \end{aligned}$$ (Step 4): We then utilize the balance principle to determine the balancing number, denoted as N .

Full size image Discussion and conclusion In this paper, we investigated Lie symmetries and the analytical solutions of the S-KdV equation. The generalized JEF method and the MAE procedure were used to acquire the exact solutions. The solutions include trigonometric, hyperbolic, rational, and exponential functions. The properties of the obtained solutions match with some known structures like periodic wave solutions, bell-shaped solitons or solitary wave solutions, kink-shaped solitons or shock wave solutions and singular soliton solutions. A kink-shaped soliton solution is characterized by boundary values of 0 and \(2\pi\) at the left infinity and right infinity, respectively. Our findings prove the soundness of the integrability of the S-KdV Eq. ( 4 ) as well as the MAE procedure and the generalized JEF method. The obtained solutions are novel and not reported in the literature in the past.
