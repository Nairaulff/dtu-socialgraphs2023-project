Introduction The oceanic floor below the continental shelf is the largest and scarcely known ecosystem and is inhabited by a high number of rare species many of which remain unknown to science 1 , 2 . The consequences of climate change, clearly visible and severe on land, also affect the fragile and unrecognized organisms living in the deepest part of the ocean 3 , 4 , 5 . Evolving under specific environmental conditions the fauna is potentially vulnerable to dynamic environmental changes that can disrupt their biological and physiological processes and reproductive cycles, leading to changes in population structure, shifts in ecosystem functioning or even extinction 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . Besides, the deep sea is designated as a territory for large-scale economic operations that could inducing extreme ecosystem transformations that are difficult to assess for scale and direction 10 . For this reason, understanding the biodiversity, in the sites directly affected by human activity or consequences caused by climate change is a priority for current research. The N Atlantic is an important sink for global ocean waters and the origin of the thermohaline circulation 11 , 12 , 13 . The dynamic warming observed in this part of the world (Atlantification) is of the highest concern due to its multifaceted threat to the climate-sensitive N Atlantic fauna 11 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 and has become a natural observatory for climate change 19 , 20 , 21 . The knowledge about which factors structure or modify benthic communities in the N Atlantic is essential for assessing whether and how the changing ecosystem affects on its sensitive fauna. The region has many complexities, and the Greenland-Icelandic-Faroe Ridge aligned perpendicular to Mid-Atlantic Ridge, is a main topographical feature separating cold Arctic waters from warmer Atlantic waters 22 , 23 and acts as a natural biological barrier 12 , 13 , 23 . It also limits biological migrations from south to north in the N Atlantic and is an ideal natural experimental zone for observing the zoogeographic shifts of fauna caused by environmental factors. For large or commercially important species (e.g. fish), the diversity and zoogeographical ranges are considered well understood when compared to smaller animals of lesser, or as yet unknown, commercial potential. Nevertheless, these smallest species are proving to be a highly diverse component of deep-sea ecosystems whose correct identification allows for reliable biological analyses, and are important object of taxonomic, phylogenetic and zoogeographic research 24 , 25 , 26 . Among these small benthic organisms is the Typhlotanaidae Sieg, 1984— a diverse and poorly known family of the peracarid Tanaidacea. The family is represented by small and specialized taxa with a three-article antennule and a ‘clinging-type’ of pereopods 4–6. These appendages have a robust basis, shorter dactylus-unguis (claw), and also a ‘clinging apparatus’ located on the carpus 27 , 28 . The last is composed of complex structures such as prickly tubercles, microtrichia or serrated spines, and is assumed to help motility of the animal inside the self-constructed housing-tube. Typhlotanaids are believed to be unselective detritivores 29 and also hosts for tantulocarids 30 and endoparasitic nematodes 31 . As with other tanaids, they have limited dispersal abilities because of their brooding behaviour and demersal juvenile stages 32 , 33 and so are considered an ideal model for zoogeographic studies and assessments of the effects of anthropogenic impact in deep-sea ecosystems 32 , 34 . The N Atlantic is known for a high diversity of Typhlotanaidae, derived from a series of studies going back to pioneering work of these peracarids in the northern European seas by Lilljeborg 35 , and Sars 1879, 1882 36 , 37 , and off Iceland and Jan Mayen Island by Hansen 1913. Hansen was also the first to demonstrate the high diversity of Typhlotanaidae, and Tanaidacea in general, below the continental shelf. From 78 recorded tanaidaceans (27 species new to science) a quarter (19 species) were classified as typhlotanaids and six of them were new to science 38 . For this reason, the N Atlantic is relatively well-studied in the context of typhlotanaid taxonomy when compared to other areas of the world. Currently, the Typhlotanaidae is represented by 100 nominal species distributed in 15 genera 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 contributing about 5% of all tanaidacean taxa and 14.5% of all known paratanaoid species, making them the most diverse family of paratanaoids. While establishing the family Sieg (1986) 43 stated that ‘Of these, Typhlotanais is still to be regarded as very heterogeneous, so that a further split is to be expected in the future’. With this observation he erected three genera ( Peraeospinosus Sieg, 1986, Meromonakantha Sieg, 1986, and Typhlotanoides Sieg, 1983) to accommodate most morphologically distinct typhlotanaids so making the first step in further exploration of typhlotanaid relationships 27 , 28 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 . Typhlotanaids were provisionally divided into ‘slender-bodied’ and ‘stout-bodied’ with body length ≥ 8.0 L:W and ≤ 6.0 L:W, respectively 27 , 28 . The ‘stout-bodied’ are currently represented by 21 species from four genera: Antiplotanais Bamber, 2008 , Larsenotanais Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007 , Typhlotanais Sars, 1882 and Typhlotanoides Sieg, 1983, and only two of them ( Typhlotanais cornutus and Typhlotanais inermis ) are recorded in the N Atlantic. In this research we focused on a rich collection of Typhlotanaidae represented by ‘stout-bodied’ form sampled from the N Atlantic during 18 international programmes and scientific cruises exploring the oceanic floor surrounding Iceland and off the NE Atlantic coasts (e.g. AFEN 1996 and 1998, BIOFAR, BIOGAS III and VI, BIOICE, Chain 106, Discovery, DTI 2000, IceAGE I and II, InCAL, POLYGAS, NORBI, Sarsia, SMBA, and Thalassa 71 and 73) (Table S1 , Fig. 1 ). Because the collections were made before the ground-breaking use of genetic methods for species identification 50 , most of the oldest collection material was fixed with formaldehyde, limiting the use of molecular methods in our study. Nevertheless, even with a limited genetic dataset applicable to the most recent collections, we could test a hypothesis that the ‘stout-bodied’ and the ‘slender-bodied’ forms comprise separate natural evolutionary lineages. Moreover, combining genetic results with meticulous examination of morphology, allows reliable identification and description of 15 new species and erection of eight new genera, which are presented in this paper. In addition to the morphological and molecular analysis, we have aimed to analyse the environmental parameters which shape the distribution of the studied species and their communities. The distribution of the studies species have been examined more thoroughly in relation to two environmental factors, e . g . depth and temperature, as this have been reported to significantly influence distribution of benthic peracarids in the N Atlantic 51 .

Full size image Results In our research we used three approaches: morphological, molecular, and environmental to delineate species in the collection of ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids represented by 1919 individuals. Each of these approaches was applied separately, and the results were compared with each other to perform species delimitation (Fig. 2 A, B). Figure 2 The phylogenetic relationships of the Typhlotanaidae ( A ) morphological tree; ( B ) Molecular tree reconstructed using the 18S sequences. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together (bootstrap support) is shown next to the branches. Full size image Molecular approach: Phylogenetic analysis A total of 20 different 18S haplotypes and 26 H3 haplotypes are newly obtained from the University of Lodz Tanaidacea collection (GenBank accession numbers: OQ034236–OQ034255 for 18S and OQ107187–OQ107212 for H3; see Table 1 ). The 18S phylogenetic tree resulting from the Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis shows relatively high support values for most clades (Fig. 2 B). Typhlotanaid species are grouped into seven well-supported clades namely, (1) “ Sarsotanais” (Italicized names are uses for nomina later described formally below); (2) “ Gudmundotanais” ; (3) “ Stuttotanais” ; 4) “ Jurundurella” ; (5) Pulcherella ; (6) Typhlamia ; and (7) “ Hansenotanais” . In addition, Baratheonus and Starkus form separate clades. The first clade is characterized by pereonites with straight margins and large prickly tubercles on the carpus of pereopods 4–6 (longer than half of the carpus length), while the others are supported by presence of ventrodistal spines in the pereopods 2–3 carpus and propodus, and biarticulate uropodal exopod and endopod. Pulcherella , Typhlamia and “ Hansenotanais” group together (p-dist Pulcherella — Typhlamia = 0.068 ± 0.009, Typhlamia — “Hansenotanais” = 0.058 ± 0.009, and Pulcherella — “Hansenotanais” = 0.063 ± 0.009) (Tab. S2) sharing the pereopod-1 carpus with at least one long distal seta, and uropods with a biarticulate endopod and uniarticulate exopod. There is good support (0.98) for the clade of “ Hansenotanais” and Typhlamia which are characterized by presence of two cusps instead of prickly tubercles on the pereopods 4–6 carpus. A relatively low support (0.6) was calculated for the clade composed with Ty. proctagon, members of ‘greenwichensis’ group and Paratyphlotanais , which shared features such as the cheliped carpus with a ‘third’ seta and antennule article-3 with an apical spur. The clade with two genera, e.g. “ Brevitanais” and “ Jurundurella” (p-dist = 0.029 ± 0.006), groups the taxa with a spine on pereopods 2–3 carpus and propodus, a long dorsodistal seta on the pereopods 2–3 propodus, and a bifurcate unguis in pereopods 4–6. The next clade consists of “ Stuttotanais”, “Gudmundotanais” and Typhlotanais sp. (support 1.0; p-dist “ Stuttotanais” —“ Gudmundotanais” = 0.008 ± 0.004, “ Stuttotanais” — Typhlotanais sp. = 0.043 ± 0.004, and “ Gudmundotanais” — Typhlotanais sp. = 0.046 ± 0.005). It groups the taxa with a basal seta shorter than maxilliped endites, and uropod with biarticulate endopod and uniarticulate exopod. The genus “ Caesatanais” that has a long ventrodistal seta in pereopods 2–3 make a speared node, similar to “ Sarsotanais” characterized by numerous spiniform nodules on the pereopod-3 merus. Table 1 Voucher codes for the museum specimens and GenBank accession numbers for the histone H3 and 18S rDNA sequences used to build the molecular trees. Full size table The genetic clustering of 18S sequences in the ML and Bayesian trees corresponds to the morphological identification of the taxa. Pairwise genetic p-distances between 18S sequences ranged between 0 and 22.6% (Table S2 ), although intraspecific genetic variability was quite low, as would be expected given the limited sample size for each species. Typhlamia and Hansenotanais formed a well-supported monophyletic clade. The clade grouping all ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids with a ‘third’ seta on the cheliped carpus ventral margin, and presence of clinging apparatus on the last three pairs of pereopods has bootstrap support of 100%. The largest genetic divergences were observed when comparing Ty. proctagon Tattersall, 1904 with Starkus sp. (p-dist = 0.105 ± 0.012) and “ H. partykae” with Starkus sp. (p-dist = 0.102 ± 0.012). For comparison, the smallest genetic distances were found between “ Su. carringtonae” and Typhlotanais sp. (p-dist = 0.011 ± 0.004) or “ G. gudmundssoni” and Typhlotanais sp. (p-dist = 0.014 ± 0.005). As with the Maximum Likelihood tree, genetic distances suggest that 'stout-bodied' forms of typhlotanaids are monophyletic. The H3 phylogenetic tree resulting from the Bayesian analysis showed relatively low support values for most clades. Typhlotanaid species grouped into only three well-supported clades namely, (1) “ Caesatanais” ; (2) Typhlotanais sp.; (2) Typhlamia sp.; (3) “ Hansenotanais” ; (4) the ‘variabilis’ group, and (5) Typhlotanais plicatus (Fig. S1). Phylogenetic approach: Morphological analysis As a result of the phylogenetic analysis, three parsimony equal trees with a length of 326 steps were obtained. A strict consensus tree was calculated from the trees obtained (Fig. 2 A). The consistency index (CI) and retention index (RI) had values of 0.53 and 0.39, respectively. In the obtained tree, the Typhlotanaidae species formed into two large clades. The first clade is composed of several 'stout-bodied' and 'slender-bodied' genera and spits into several smaller clades. In the first clade “ Gudmundotanais” is most distinct taxon and makes a separate lineage supported by the following synapomorphies: antennule article-1 2.6 L:W, antenna article-2 without seta, pereopod-1 basis 0.6× other articles, pereopod-1 merus 2.1 L:W, pereopods 2–3 propodus with long dorsodistal seta (longer than dactylus) and uropod exopod 0.9× endopod. The more internal clade includes three species of the genus “ Hansenotanais” (Bremer support 0.49) that share a long ventrodistal seta on the carpus (longer than half of the propodus) in pereopods 2–3. In three equal parsimony trees, these species swap places within this subclade. The most internal clade forms a cascade of branches composed of 'slender-bodied' typhlotanaids ( Typhlamia sp., Pulcherella sp., Ty. proctagon , and Ty. greenwichensis ) as well as two ‘stout-bodied’ species of the genus “ Caesatanais” (Bremer 0.2) . Their common feature is a long ventrodistal seta on the pereopod-1propodus. The other main clade consists of exclusively 'stout-bodied' typhlotanaids and is further split into two subclades. The first subclade is made by: “ Sarsotanais” , “ Egregiella” and “ Stuttotanais” (Bremer 0.2) and is supported by: antenna article-2 with a seta, calcified microtrichia on the merus of pereopods 2–3, a carpus with short ventrodistal seta in pereopods 2–3, and the propodus with short dorsodistal seta in pereopods 4–6. The other subclade includes “ Jurundurella” and “ Brevitanais” (Bremer 0.36). “ Jurundurella” is morphologically distinct taxon characterized by straight margins of the pereonites and long dorsodistal seta (longer than dactylus) in pereopods 2–3 propodus. The more internal clade is formed by eight species of “ Brevitanais” (Bremer 0.36) with antenna article-2 1.6 L:W and long dorsodistal seta pereopods 4–6 propodus. The “ Brevitanais” is further separated by articulation of the uropods and apical spur in antennule article-3. Therefore “ Br. andeepae” and “ Br. cornutus” as the only Brevitanais taxa with biarticulate uropod rami and antennal spur are grouped together (Bremer 0.38). The other “ Brevitanais” taxa are further split into two clades. The first, with “ Br. sadleckae” and “ Br. nagayae” (support 0.36), groups taxa with several characters, e.g. antennule article-1 3.2 L:W, antenna article-2 1.8 L:W, antenna article-3 without seta, pereopod-1 basis 0.4× other articles and pereopod-1 merus 2.0 L:W. The other larger clade consists well supported clade with four species: “ Br. anitae” , “ Br. adipatus” , “ Br. kozakowskae” and “ Br. skolimowskae” (Bremer 0.45), which have medium-sized cusps in the maxilliped endites. Taxonomy Family Typhlotanaidae Sieg, 1984 Diagnosis (after Bird & Larsen, 2009 52 see Gellert, Palero & Błażewicz, 2022 28 ). Type genus Typhlotanais G. O. Sars, 1882. Genera included Antiplotanais Bamber, 2008; Aremus Segadilha, Gellert & Błażewicz, 2018; Baratheonus Gellert, Palero & Błażewicz, 2022; Dimorphognathia Sieg, 1986; Larsenotanais Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007 ; Lannisterella Gellert, Palero & Błażewicz, 2022; Meromonakantha Sieg, 1986; Obesutanais Larsen, Błażewicz-Paszkowycz & Cunha, 2006; Paratyphlotanais Kudinova-Pasternak & Pasternak, 1978; Peraeospinosus Sieg, 1986; Pulcherella Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007; Starkus Gellert, Palero & Błażewicz, 2022; Targaryenella Błażewicz & Segadilha, 2019; Torquella Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007; Typhlamia Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007; Typhlotanais Sars, 1882 and Typhlotanoides Sieg, 1983; Brevitanais n. gen.; Caesatanais n. gen.; Egregiella n. gen.; Hansenotanais n. gen.; Gudmundotanais n. gen.; Jurundurella n. gen.; Sarsotanais n. gen.; Stuttotanais n. gen. Remarks Soon after it was erected, the family’s type genus— Typhlotanais become a repository taxon to include what are now suspected to be phylogenetically unrelated taxa. Apart from several distinct families such as paratanaids, nototanaids and pseudotanaids, almost all blind (Gk. typhlos /τυφλός) species with a three-article antennule and uni- or biarticulate uropod rami were regarded as a ‘typhlotanaids’. Błażewicz-Paszkowycz (2007) 27 has stated that apart from the type species, Typhlotanais aequiremis (Lilljeborg, 1864), most taxa classified as Typhlotanais probably represent other, still undefined, genera 27 , 28 . She has also proposed a pragmatic classification of typhlotanaids into ‘long-bodied’ and ‘short-bodied’ forms (replaced by ‘slender-bodied’ and ‘stout-bodied’ respectively in this paper) and eight established morpho-groups 27 , 28 proposing a preliminary systematic order for the typhlotanaids. Due to material limitations (many of the historical species taxa developed by Hansen (1913) were represented only by the holotype, and many taxa described by Kudinova-Pasternak are considered lost), she emphasised that proposed by her division is only provisional and requires further study using more species, based on more morphological characters and using genetic data. From all typhlotanaid taxa analysed by Błażewicz-Paszkowycz (2007), only two Ty. cornutus and Ty. eximius represented ‘stout-bodied’ forms. Invariant or near-invariant characters in the ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaid groups Rostrum shallow, acute. Antenna article-1 fused with cephalothorax. Labrum hood shaped, distally setulate. Mandible molar broad, with distal margin nodulose. Labium bilobed. Maxillule endite with eight spines. Maxilliped basis with distal seta. Maxilliped palp four-article; article-2 with three inner and one outer setae; article-3 with four inner setae; article-4 with five terminal and one subdistal setae. Cheliped basis separated from pereonite by short gap. Cheliped merus triangular/wedge-shaped with ventral seta. Cheliped carpus dorsal margin with dorsodistal chemosensory seta and proximal seta. Cheliped fixed finger with two ventral setae and three near cutting margin. Pereopods 1–3 walking type; pereopods 4–6 clinging type. Pereopods 1–3 ischium with one ventral seta; unguis simple. Pereopods 4–6 ischium with two ventral setae; propodus with one (P4–5) or three (P6) dorsodistal setae. Pleopod basal article naked. Uropod exopod with two unequal setae (length and thickness). These are excluded from the following descriptions apart from where an exception is observed. Larsenotanais Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007 Diagnosis Body stout, pereonites margin rounded. Antennule article-1 short (< 4.0 L:W), inner margin with fewer than four setae. Maxilliped basis seta longer than endites, endite cusps small or medium size. Cheliped carpus long (> 2.5 L:W), carpus with long ventral seta (> 0.9× carpus W). Pereopod-1 merus L:W slender (> 3.0 L:W), carpus without long seta; pereopods 2–3 carpus ventrodistal seta short, microtrichia regular (if present); pereopods 4–6 carpus with prickly tubercles, propodus distodorsal seta short (< unguis and dactylus length), unguis simple. Uropod endopod and exopod uniarticulate. Male swimming type. Type species Larsenotanais amabilis Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007. Species included Larsenotanais amabilis Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007; L. crassus (Dojiri & Sieg, 1997) n. comb.; L. kamchatikus Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007; L. martini n. sp.; L. siegi n. sp.; L. tillardi Bamber, 2014. Remarks Błażewicz-Paszkowycz (2007) 27 established Larsenotanais for one species. As a result of the present study, the genus now comprises five species including the incompletely described Typhlotanais crassus (Dojiri & Sieg, 1997). Larsenotanais is morphologically similar to the Brevitanais n. gen. group-1 and Caesatanais (see below) by having uniarticulate uropod rami, but the simple unguis on pereopods 4–6 distinguishes it from the other two groups (Table 2 ) of similar uropodal form. Another useful character separating Larsenotanais from Brevitanais group-1 and Caesatanais is the short distodorsal propodal seta in pereopods 4–5 (long in Brevitanais and Caesatanais ). It should be noted that at least several typhlotanaids ‘stout-bodied’ tanaids have short distodorsal propodal seta in pereopods 4–5, however, the articulation of the uropods (Table 2 ) in combination with the cheliped character, or setation and ornamentation of the appendages, distinguishes Larsenotanais . For example, Larsenotanais has a relatively stout cheliped carpus of (2.4–3.1 L:W) that is clearly more slender in Egregiella (about 5.0 L:W), and lacks a long ventrodistal seta on pereopods 2–3 carpus that is present in Hansenotanais . Larsenotanais has only regular microtrichia on the pereopods 2–3 merus that are robust and well calcified in Sarsotanais and Stuttotanais . Furthermore, Larsenotanais lacks an apical spur on antennule article-3 that is present in Gudmundotanais , and has rounded pereonite margins, which are straight in Jurundurella .

Cheliped carpus 2.5 L:W. Pereopod-1 basis two dorsal and one ventral setae; pereopod-2 carpus 2.4 L:W. Uropod exopod 0.8× endopod. Distribution Known from one location south of the Antarctic Peninsula, from the depth range 51–285 m 56 . Remarks Sieg (1986) illustrated and described a species that is considered to be conspecific with Typhlotanais adipatus described by Tzareva (1982) 57 from the shelf of the Cosmonaut Sea in E Antarctica based on collections made on the shelf of the western Antarctic Peninsula. Also, he considered his species to be a representative of the genus Peraeospinosus . As a consequence, the species described by Tzareva ( Ty. adipatus ) has become member of Peraeospinosus . In light of current knowledge and with a better understanding of the morphology of typhlotanaids, it is clear that Sieg (1986) 56 and Tzareva (1982) 57 studied two distinct species belonging to two different genera. This difference was perceived by Błażewicz-Paszkowycz (2007) 27 who classified Tzareva’s Ty. adipatus to the ‘cornutus’ group, but considered Sieg’s Ty. adipatus a synonym of Typhlotanais greenwichensis Shiino, 1970. Unfortunately, Tzareva incompletely illustrated her specimen, but in her figure of the pereopod-4 (Tzareva 1982: Fig. 9 57 ) has a propodus distodorsal seta clearly longer than in the same appendage illustrated by Sieg (Sieg 1986: Fig. 55 56 ). Besides, the two taxa have a quite different body habitus, where short pereonites and a short cephalothorax are clear in Tzareva’s species and more elongated pereonites and a slender cephalothorax are present in Sieg’s species. The set of these features is sufficient to assess that the species described by Tzareva is closely related to Typhlotanais cornutus G.O. Sars, 1879, in contrast to the species described by Sieg. Since it has all the characteristics that define genus Larsenotanais , we have made the decision to transfer it to this genus, and name it as Larsenotanais siegi n. sp. Larsenotanais amabilis and L. siegi are two Antarctic Larsenotanais congeners which could be distinguished by the length of pereonite-1 (clearly shorter than pereonite-2 in L. siegi , and almost as long as pereonite-2 in L. amabilis ), and the setation of antenna article-2 (one seta in L. amabilis , and two in L. siegi ). Finally, the distodorsal seta on the propodus of pereopods 4–5 is long in L. siegi (reaching the end of dactylus) and short in L. amabilis (0.5× dactylus). Larsenotanais tillardi Bamber, 2014 Larsenotanais tillardi —Bamber (2014) 58 : 18–23. Diagnosis Body 5.0 L:W. Pereonite-1 shortest, half as long as pereonite-2. Antenna article-2 with short seta; article-3 with short seta. Cheliped carpus 3.0 L:W. Pereopod-1 basis naked. Uropod exopod 0.8× endopod. Distribution Known only from the type locality: Azores, Sabrina Bank, from 140 to 200 m 58 . Remarks As L. tillardi , three other Larsenotanais species have an uropod exopod reaching 0.8× of endopod length. Nevertheless L. tillardi differs from L. amabilis and L. siegi by the lack of mesial setation on the uropod endopod, where L. amabilis has a PSS and L. siegi has four simple and two PSS. Also, L. tillardi has a naked pereopod-1 basis, where L. amabilis has a middorsal seta and L. siegi has two middorsal setae and proximoventral seta. Key for identification of Larsenotanais neuters Diagnosis Body stout, pereonite margins convex (rounded). Antennule article-1 short (< 4.0 L:W), mesial margin with fewer than four setae. Maxilliped basis seta longer than endites, endite cusps moderate. Cheliped carpus short (< 2.5 L:W), carpus with short ventral seta. Pereopod-1 merus L:W short (< 3.0 L:W), carpus without long seta; pereopods 2–3 carpus ventrodistal seta short, microtrichia regular (if present); pereopods 4–6 carpus with prickly tubercles, propodus distodorsal seta long, unguis bifurcate. Uropod endopod and exopod uniarticulate or biarticulate. Type genus Brevitanais andeepae (Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007). Species included Brevitanais adipatus (Tzareva, 1982) n. comb; Br. andeepae (Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007) n. comb.; Br. cornutus (G. O. Sars, 1879) n. comb; Br. anitae n. sp.; Br. kozakowskae n. sp.; Br. nagayae n. sp.; Br. sadleckae n. sp.; Br. skolimowskae n. sp. Etymology Brevis [Gr.] means short, reflecting the stout habitus of species classified in this genus. Remarks Błażewicz-Paszkowycz (2007) 27 proposed a morpho-group ‘cornutus’ for typhlotanaids with a ‘stout-bodied’ habitus as: Ty. cornutus ; Ty. adipatus ; Ty. crassus , and Ty. andeepae Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007, and noted that these species have biarticulate uropod rami. A further detailed analysis of nine species (four listed species and five new species studied during the current study), which morphologically fit well into the group, support establishing a new genus— Brevitanais . The new genus is defined by several morphological characters that allows separation from the other ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids (Table 2 ). A long dorsodistal seta on the pereopods 4–6 propodus is characteristic of Brevitanais and Caesatanais , although the former as genus has a short antennule article-1 (long in Caesatanais ) and rounded pereonite margins (straight in Caesatanais ). Because of the variety in uropod articulation, the genus is provisionally divided into three groups based on the number of articles in both uropod rami: group-1 with uniarticulate uropodal rami; group-2 with uniarticulate uropodal exopod and biarticulate uropodal endopod, and group-3 with biarticulate uropodal rami. Brevitanais group-1 Diagnosis Uropod rami uniarticulate; exopod about 0.8–0.9× endopod. Species included Brevitanais adipatus (Tzareva, 1982); Brevitanais skolimowskae n. sp. (see below); Brevitanais anitae n. sp. (see below). Remarks The species classified to Brevitanais n. gen. group-1 are most similar to Larsenotanais species by having uniarticulate uropod rami and short antennule article-1, although they also have a bifurcate unguis in pereopods 4–6 (simple in Larsenotanais ) and a shorter cheliped carpus, which is < 2.4 L:W (> 2.4 L:W in Larsenotanais ). Typhlotanais bolarticulus Segadilha & Serejo, 2022 has been provisionally classified in the ‘cornutus’ group 59 . Because of its unarticulate exopod rami it could be specifically classified within the Brevitanais group-1, although several morphological characters highlight its morphological distinctiveness, e.g.: large distoventral spine on the pereopods 2–3 carpus (relatively small in Brevitanais ), simple pereopods 4–6 unguis (bifurcate in Brevitanais ) and large prickly tubercles on the pereopods 4–6 carpus, which cover most of the article’s ventral side (small in Brevitanais ). Besides, Ty. bolarticulus has parallel pereonite margins in dorsal view, which are clearly rounded in all Brevitanais species . For this reason, we conclude that Ty. bolarticulus probably is not closely related to any of the taxa related to Brevitanais (‘earlier’ as ‘cornutus’ group), and leave its in original generic classification ( Typhlotanais ) until its taxonomic position is better understood. Nevertheless, it is worth emphasizing that by having certain features, i.e. pereopods 2–3 carpus and propodus with spines and pereopods 4–6 carpus with large prickly tubercles Ty. bolarticulus may resemble Starkus Gellert, Palero & Błażewicz, 2022, although having uniarticulate uropods and a ‘stout-bodied’ form, exclude the species from that genus.

Remarks See remarks for Br. andeepae. Key for identification of Brevitanais neuters Diagnosis Body short, pereonite margins straight. Antennule article-1 slender (> 4.0 L:W), mesial margin with seta. Maxilliped basis seta longer than endites, endite cusps small. Cheliped carpus short (< 2.5 L:W), carpus with short ventral seta. Pereopod-1 merus L:W slender (> 3.0 L:W), carpus with at least three long setae; pereopods 2–3 carpus ventrodistal seta long, microtrichia regular (if present); pereopods 4–6 carpus with prickly tubercles, propodus distodorsal seta long, unguis bifurcate. Uropod endopod and exopod uniarticulate. Type genus Caesatanais igae n. sp. Etymology Caesaires [Lat.] means long hair, alluding to the presence of uniquely long setae on various the pereopod articles. Species included Caesatanais igae n. sp.; Caesatanais isiae n. sp. Remarks Caesatanais n. gen. is defined by the presence of straight-margined pereonites, a long ventrodistal seta on the carpus of pereopods 2–3, and uniarticulate uropod rami. The straight pereonal margins is a unique character for ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids so far, while the long setae on the carpus of pereopods 2–3 is shared with Hansenotanais . Nevertheless, members of Hansenotanais have a biarticulate uropod endopod. The uniarticulate uropods rami are shared with Larsenotanais and J. bioice although these both have a simple unguis on pereopods 4–6. Caesatanais igae n. sp.

LSID urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:35388ACC-59A3-4257-9CF2-16EAF603CE8D. Diagnosis Body stout, pereonite margins rounded. Antennule article-1 long (5.4 > L:W), mesial margin with three setae. Maxilliped basis seta shorter than endites, endite cusps small. Cheliped carpus slender (> 2.5 L:W), carpus with short ventral seta.

Uropods long and slender, endopod biarticulate, exopod biarticulate. Type species Egregiella eximia (Hansen, 1913) (by monotypy). Species included Egregiella eximia (Hansen, 1913) n. comb. Etymology Egregie [Lat.] means magnificent, which alluding to the delight Hansen surely felt when he described the species, and which is captured in the species name ( eximius [Lat.] means super ). Remarks The peculiar body habitus of Egregiella eximia and a unique set of morphological features are sufficient to define a new genus-level morphological group for this species. It has a very long and slender antennule article-1 (> 5.5 L:W; often much shorter then 4.0 L:W in most ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids) and elongate, biarticulate uropod rami. From the all ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids, this type of uropod is present in Brevitanais group-3, although all Brevitanais species have bifurcate unguis in pereopods 4–6, which is simple in E. eximia . Similarly, the long antennule article-1 is observed in several ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids e.g.: Hansenotanais , Caesatanais , Sarsotanais and Stuttotanais (see below) but again they have (with exception of Stuttotanais ) a bifurcate pereopods 4–6 unguis. Stuttotanais , has uniarticulate uropod exopods, excluding it from the group. Egregiella eximia (Hansen, 1913) n. comb.

Hansenotanais Gellert, Błażewicz & Bird n. gen. LSID urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:E59A8A66-E71A-467B-9B41-89997C770695. Diagnosis Body stout and robust, pereonite margins rounded. Antennule article-1 long and slender (> 4.0 L:W), inner margin with three setae. Maxilliped basis seta longer than endites, endite cusps moderate. Cheliped carpus stout (< 2.5 L:W), carpus with short ventral seta. Pereopod-1 merus L:W relatively stout (< 3.0 L:W), carpus without long seta; pereopods 2–3 carpus ventrodistal seta long, microtrichia regular (if present); pereopods 4–6 carpus with low cusps, propodus distodorsal seta short, unguis bifurcate. Uropod endopod biarticulate, exopod uniarticulate. Type genus Hansenotanais partykae n. sp. (by designation). Etymology The name of the genus is in honour of Hans Jacob Hansen—Danish zoologist and pioneer in research of deep water Typhlotanaidae. Species included Hansenotanais inermis (Hansen, 1913) n. comb.; Hansenotanais hansjacobi n. sp.; Hansenotanais partykae n. sp. Remarks The genus Hansenotanais n. gen. is characterized by the rounded pereonite margins, presence of a long seta on the pereopods 2–3 carpus, cusps (not prickly tubercles) on pereopods 4–6 carpus, and biarticulate uropodal endopod and unarticulate exopod. The lack of prickly tubercles and presence of carpal cusp clearly distinguishes Hansenotanai s from most of the ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids. So far only Obesutanais lacks prickly tubercles in the pereopods 4–6 carpus, although both genera can be distinguished by the long dorsodistal seta on pereopods 4–6 in Obesutanais and short dorsodistal seta on pereopods 4–6 in Hansenotanais . It is worthy to noting that similar carpal cusps are present in the genus Typhlamia , which belongs to the ‘slender-bodied’ Typhlotanaidae.

Distribution Known from one location off Iceland (Norwegian Sea) (Fig. 31 ) from 315.9 to 316.6 m (this study). Remarks The presence of a ventrodistal long seta on the carpus of pereopods 2–3 separates Hansenotanais partykae n. sp. from H. inermis , which has only a short seta on the carpus of pereopods 2–3. See also remarks for H. hansjacobi . Key for identification of Hansenotanais neuters Jurundurella Gellert, Błażewicz & Bird n. gen. LSID urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:79BC9044-AE64-47D1-8219-EDF8B00D38FE. Diagnosis Body stout, pereonite margins straight. Antennule article-1 short (< 4.0 L:W), mesial margin with 4 ≤ setae. Maxilliped basis seta shorter than endites, endite cusps small. Cheliped carpus stout (< 2.5 L:W) carpus with short ventral seta. Pereopod-1 merus L:W stout (< 3.0 L:W), carpus without long seta; pereopods 2–3 carpus ventrodistal seta short, microtrichia regular (if present); pereopods 4–6 carpus with prickly tubercles, propodus distodorsal seta short, unguis bifurcate. Uropod endopod and exopod uniarticulate. Type species Jurundurella bioice n. sp. (by monotypy). Etymology The genus is name in honour of Prof. Jörundur Svavarsson, the scientific leader of the project BIOICE, acknowledged specialist in marine fauna and a great lover of Iceland's biodiversity. Remarks A combination of uniarticulate uropod rami and bifurcate pereopods 4–6 unguis makes Jurundurella similar to the Brevitanais group-1 and Caesatanais . However, Jurundurella has a short ventrodistal seta on the pereopods 2–3 carpus (long in Caesatanais ), and straight pereonites (rounded in Brevitanais ). Jurundurella has the pereopods 1–6 basis armed with several distinct spines. So far, similar spines have been observed in Typhlotanais bolarticulus Segadilha & Serejo, 2022, but present only on the basis of the pereopods 1–3. Besides, Jurundurella has a ‘third’ seta on the cheliped carpus, and small prickly tubercles in pereopods 4–6 carpus, while Ty. bolarticulus lacks the ‘third’ seta and has apparently large prickly tubercles.

Uropod endopod biarticulate, exopod uniarticulate. Type species Sarsotanais georgi n. sp. (by designation). Etymology Genus named in honour of George Ossian Sars Norwegian marine and freshwater biologist. Species included Sarsotanais georgi n. sp.; Sarsotanais sp. A (from Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007 27 ). Remarks The genus Sarsotanais n. gen. is defined as a ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaid group with its rounded-margin pereonites and the carpus of pereopods 2–3 carpus having spiniform, robust and calcified, microtrichia. The bifurcate unguis on the pereopods 4–6 distinguishes Sarsotanais from Larsenotanais , Egregiella and Stuttotanais (with simple pereopods 4–6 unguis), while the lack of seta on antenna article-3 separates it from Caesatanais and G. gudmundssoni that have a seta. Furthermore, the Sarsotanais has a short distodorsal seta on the propodus of pereopods 4–5, whereas all members of Brevitanais and Caesatanais have a long seta. Finally, the Sarsotanais has a long seta on the pereopod-1 carpus, in contrast to Jurundurella bioice and Stuttotanais frenchae , with a short seta.

Remarks Sarsotanais georgi n. sp. and Sarsotanais (= Typhlotanais ) sp. A (recorded by Błażewicz-Paszkowycz from the Antarctic) share: similar body habit, rounded margins of pereonites, wider than long, pereonites 3–5 subequal and pereonite-1 shorter than the others with a sternal spur (hyposphenium). Nevertheless the species can be distinguished by the length of the cheliped carpus that is relatively stout (2.9 L:W) in Sa. georgi and more slender (3.6 L:W) in Sarsotanais sp. A. Also, the Sa. georgi species has many setae on the basis of pereopods 1–3, where Sarsotanais sp. A has only three. Sarsotanais sp. A Typhlotanais sp. A Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007 27 1598: 132–135.

Distribution Known from one station in the Faroe Channel, from depths of 290–302.5 m (Fig. 31 ) (this study). Remarks Stuttotanais frenchae n sp. shares a uniarticulate uropodal exopod and biarticulate endopod with two genera: Hansenotanais and Sarsotanais , but also with two species; G. gudmundssoni and Su. carringtonae (see below). The presence of typical prickly tubercles on the carpus of pereopods 4–6 separates Su. frenchae from Hansenotanais (has cusps in pereopod 4–6 carpus) and dorsodistal seta G. gudmundssoni , while a simple unguis in pereopod 4–6 from Stuttotanais carringtonae (bifurcate unguis in pereopod 4–6). Finally, Su. frenchae is a more slender species that has short meral setae on the pereopod-1, where the Sarsotanais has clearly robust body and has two long meral setae. Key for identification of neuters ‘stout-bodied’ forms* Distribution analysis Cluster analysis applied to the distribution data yielded two distinct groups of regions (Fig. 51 , Table 3 ). The samples from the Iceland Basin (IcB), Porcupine-Biscay Abyssal (PBA) and Rockall Trough (RoT) with extensive mean depths (1837–3394 m) are grouped, characterized by three species: C. igae , C. isiae and G. gudmunsdssoni . The other large clade includes shallower stations (503–1655 m) and consists of two subclusters: (1) Denmark Strait (DeS) and Norwegian Sea (NoS), both defined by low mean water temperature (from − 0.2 to 0.7 °C), and (2) the clade grouping the Faroe Plateau (FaP), Iceland-Faroe Ridge (IFR), Feni Ridge (FeR), Irminger Basin (IrB) and W European Slope (WES). FaP and IFR are characterized by low mean temperature (1.0–1.6 °C) and FeR, IrB and WES by much warmer mean temperatures (4.2–6.4 °C). Brevitanais kozakowskae and Br. skolimowskae are the key species in the first subclade. In the other subclade, no key species could be discerned, although the most distinct Faroe Plateau was represented by five species, three of which, Hansenotanais hansjacobi , Stuttotanais frenchae and St. carringtonae appear endemic. The Reykjanes Ridge (RR) was the most distinct region with the characteristic species Brevitanais anitae , Br. sadleckae and Larsenotanais martini . That region is defined by relatively shallow depths (730 m) and warm waters (5.8 °C). Figure 51 Dendrogram of predefined regions (Table 3 ) for typhlotanaid species (Canberra similarity, transformed data, complete method); the mean environmental parameters defining the regions are in Table 2 .

Full size image Table 3 Number of samples with ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids recorded from the studied collection in eleven distinguished regions. Full size table The distribution of taxa in gradient of the depth and temperature (Fig. 52 , Table S3 ) reveals a clear ‘preference’ of Brevitanais for shallow water, i.e. between 209 and 716 m (with one exception of Br. nagayae that was recorded at 1384.8 m), although the species are well separated by temperature: below < 0 °C, Br. kozakowskae and Br. skolimowskae , and 3.8–7.6 °C by Br. nagayae, Br. sadleckae, and Br. anitae . A distinctly low temperature affinity is observed for Hansenotanais species, which are present in the upper bathyal north of Iceland (Figs. 1 , 52 ). The distribution of H. inermis, as J. bioice, is clearly limited to the upper bathyal (209– ~ 2000 m) of southern Iceland and significantly warmer waters (3.5–7.7 °C), but the temperature ranges for J. bioice has been recorded in W European Slope at 7.9–11.1 °C and Rockall Trough (~ 2.7 °C). Gudmundotanais gudmundssoni is a taxon of deeper bathyal regions (1332.5–2946 m; one station at 715 m) and present in a relatively narrow water temperatures range (4.0–2.7 °C). A similar distribution is shown by Caesatanais igae (2.5–3.2 °C) and Sarsotanais georgi (4.6–6.4 °C), although their bathymetric ranges extended from lower bathyal to abyssal e.g., 2191–4832 m and 1974–4829 m, respectively.

Full size image Discussion Incorporation of a variety of scientific methods for species delimitation, biodiversity and zoogeographical studies is extremely useful in the study of deep-sea fauna represented by a large number of rare and unknown species 12 , 13 , 24 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 . In our research genetic and morphological approaches were combined to examine a rich and diverse collection of historical and more recent deep-sea tanaidaceans collected in the N Atlantic. Despite these efforts, we were not able to obtain sequences from both markers for all targeted individuals and, as a result, could not construct a concatenated tree. Nevertheless, even with our limited results and relying on a conservative molecular marker such as 18S, it was possible to assess the diversity of 'stout bodied' typhlotanaids. In order to define a new genus and species we used integrative approach confronting 18S phylogeny and morphological diversity. Because 18S is very conservative marker, we assumed that each clade represented a taxonomical unit that we understand as a genus. The integrative approach was used for the first time for investigation of Tanaidacea and offered a solution through which deficiencies in our genetic or morphological data can be mutually supplemented and confirmed. In our research we focused on ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids recovered in 185 samples of over 1465 benthic samples from the N Atlantic over the last five decades (Table S1 ), supporting the view that the deep-sea fauna of the N Atlantic is relatively well-recognized. By discovering 15 new typhlotanaids species to science and establishing eight new genera and talking into account that our material represents only a small portion form a much larger collection of tanaids, we conclude that knowledge on the diversity of tanaidaceans in the N Atlantic is still far from being completed. In addition, the result of our study elevates the total number of known typhlotanaids species by 13%, and total number typhlotanaids genera by 35% compared to already published taxa (WoRMS accessed 6 April. 2023). Before our research, three ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids were recorded from the N Atlantic ( Typhlotanais cornutus , Typhlotanais eximius and Typhlotanais inermis ) and none of them was recovered by us. Eight taxa targeted by us taxa were delineated with a conservative DNA fragment (18S) and calculation of intra- and infra-species genetic variability allowed us to infer reliable species delimitation (Table S2 ). Except for a pair of closely related species ( Stuttotanais frenchae and Su. carringtonae ), we could not obtain COI sequences for all putative species, however calculated genetic distances prompted us to seek for morphological differences segregating both species and further morphological search to delineated morphologically similar species (Table 2 ). Morphology The morphological characteristics that define the clades distinguished using the 18S marker contribute to defining the diagnoses for the genera we have distinguished, but also provide a better understanding of the features (or “characters”), many of which have been previously either underestimated or not even perceived 28 , 67 , 73 . Among the important and easy to observe diagnostic features is the articulation and character of the uropods (length relative to the body, and proportions of individual members). Direct observation of deep-sea tanaids is virtually impossible, but it is assumed that the uropod exposed at the posterior opening of the tube may acquire the environmental cues in posterior part of the tanaid analogous to the antennae exposed to its anterior part 60 , 74 , thus could be a subject to evolution by natural selection. Usually, all stout typhlotanaids have rather short uropods in relation to the body, in which the exopod usually reaches 0.8–0.9 of endopod length. The shortest exopod is in the genus Hansenotanais (0.6 × endopod), while the most elongate uropods are observed in Egregiella , where both uropod rami are almost equal. It should be noted that, with some exceptions, none of the taxa we have distinguished can be diagnosed on the basis of a single apomorphy, but rather by a unique combination of several features (Table 2 ). For example, the setation of the pereopods and character of clinging apparatus in pereopods 4–6 was proved to be a diagnostic character 27 , 28 . The modern imaging techniques 50 applied in our research allowed us to demonstrate that the presence of prickly tubercles is not invariant in the typhlotanaids. Although many of the ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids have them well developed, they are absent in genus Hansenotanai s (Fig. 35 D) (also absent in Typhlamia ). A bifurcate unguis in the pereopods 4–6 is present in several genera, Brevitanais, Hansenotanais, Caesatanais, Jurundurella , Sarsotanais and Stuttotanais , but only Brevitanais and Caesatanais have a long propodus dorsodistal seta in the pereopods 4–6. Furthermore, calcified microtrichia in pereopods 2 and 3 are unique for Stuttotanais and Sarsotanais (Figs. 44 , 47 , 50 ), although Sarsotanais has them in pereopod-2 merus and carpus, while Stuttotanais only on the pereopod-2 merus. Finally, Jurundurella has distinct spines on the basis of the pereopods 2–5 (Fig. 40 ) which are unique feature. Similar spines however are observed also in two other species: Typhlotanais spinibasis (although spines on basis of pereopods 4–6) and Typhlotanais spinipes (spines present in pereopods 2–5). However, Ty. spinibasis is a slender-bodied typhlotanaid (8.5 L:W) and because of long setae in merus, carpus and propodus in pereopods 1–3 was classified to ‘ptrispinosus’ group (Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007), while Ty. spinipes has biarticulate uropod rami (unriarticulate in Jurundurella ), long and slender antennule (short in Jurundurella ), and ventrodistal seta in propodus 2–3 (spine in Jurundurella ) 59 , 75 . Intriguingly, Ty spinipes , as Jurundurella , has long distal setae in pereopods 2–3 (Fig. 40 ), thus further study with more material and possible genetic data are needed to test if those taxa are congeneric or at least are phylogenetically closely related taxa. Phylogeny The Typhlotanaidae is recognized to be a highly diverse tanaidomorphan family whose persived polyphyletic nature has been frequently underlined 27 , 28 , 39 , 76 , 77 . Our phylogenetic results, which were based on two markers, should be considered only as a primary step towards complex phylogenetic studies of 'stout-bodied' forms of this family. Nevertheless, the examination of reference barcodes 18S and H3 is given for five new genera ( Brevitanais, Caesatanais, Gudmundotanais, Hansenotanais and Stuttotanais ) and these data are a baseline for future assignment of new (and difficult-to-identify) 'stout-bodied' typhlotanaids species. The low support of some clades in the 18S tree can be explained by the insufficient number of genera included in the analysis, and it is expected that a more complete analysis with more genera will improve the statistical parameters of the tree. The unrelated clades group together by with low support. Baratheonus groups with the ‘stout-bodied’ clade in the 18S tree and several ‘stout-bodied’ genera ( Caesatanais and Gudmundotanais ) group with the ‘slender-bodied’ forms in the morphological tree. The gene H3 has an erratic pattern of substitution and is not resolved. Nevertheless, it is quite apparent that the ‘stout-bodied’ forms do constitute a monophyletic group ( Brevitanais, Egregiella, Gudmundotanais, Jurundurella, Sarsotanais and Stuttotanais ). The Hansenotanais that grouped with Typhlamia share the cusps in the pereopods 4–6 where the other 'stout-bodied' typhlotanaids have prickly tubercles. Moreover, the morphological tree is congruent with the genetic tree and consists of two large clades with ‘stout-bodied’ forms and ‘slender-bodied’ typhlotanaids. The latter clade is supported by the pereopod-1 propodus with a long ventrodistal seta. The appearance of two ‘stout-bodied’ forms ( Caesatanais and Gudmundotanais ) in this group may be coincidental. The exception is the genus Hansenotanais , which in molecular trees (18S and H3) is always grouped with Typhlamia . Morphological affinities are considered insufficient for testing evolutionary hypotheses because of interference from homoplasy and convergence 78 . The scarcity of genetic data in our research, which could serve for haplotype and private allele inquiry, hamper inferences concerning the radiation of taxa grouped in specific clades. Nevertheless, grouping of all Icelandic Brevitanais in one clade in the morphological tree, is certainly worth noting, especially that Ty. cornutus (Kval Island, N Norway) and Ty. adipatus (W Antarctic) group in a paraphyletic node. Although, the lack of genetic, biogeographical data does not provide a way to go much beyond conjecture, we can hypothesize that high diversity of Icelandic Brevitanais might be result of panmictic populations that genetically diverged after fragmentation from the Quaternary Last Glacial Maxima (LGM). The grounded ice cover that growing on the Arctic shelf forced fauna to migrate to ice-free locations obtainable at greater depths i.e. lower shelf or bathyal or southerly waters 22 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 . Brevitanais taxa that reveal clear preference for lower shelf depths seems to be naturally predestined to survive glacial maxima on the Icelandic slope. The bathyal glacial shelters are not particularly thoroughly explored in the Arctic, where the research focused on the shallow littoral fauna 80 , 83 , but the Antarctic fauna could only survive a glaciation period in deeper glacial refuges due to its long and profound topographic isolation 24 , 84 , 85 , 86 . Diversity The typhlotanaids are seen to be a diverse family of deep-sea communities with contribution of 11–25% to all tanaidaceans recovered from the NE Pacific, W Australian Slope or E Antarctic 55 , 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 . Regardless of the high diversity, the typhlotanaids were often recorded as unique taxa, represented by few individuals 91 , 92 . The low frequency and abundance of small deep-sea fauna, as tanaidaceans, are constricted by trophic and physio-chemical conditions of the ecosystem 93 , 94 , is more often low a consequence of sampling efforts resulted from high cost and logistical challenges of deep-sea surveys 9 , 95 . In our research, we analysed a well sampled area of the N Atlantic (Table 3 ). With four of eleven large regions particularly so (W European Seas, Rockall Trough, Iceland Basin, and Norwegian Sea) with 75% of the collected samples. Much less sampled, but also smaller, regions, were the Reykjanes and Feni Ridge (16 and 4 samples, respectively). Regardless of the sampling efforts, ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids were present in 10.6–33.6% of samples, with the exception of best sampled WES region where the ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids occurred in only 2.2% of all samples. With current knowledge, it is difficult to conclude why ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids are relatively lacking in the WES region. Because average temperatures (6.1 ± 1.6 °C) and mean depth (1274.3 ± 489.3 m) of WES are similar to those in Irminger Basin where ‘stout-bodied’ typhlotanaids were recovered in 13% samples, it is rather doubtful that such distribution is the effect of environmental selection. Certainly, this result deserves further and more detailed research, including modelling based on extensive data covering the other groups of Typhlotanaidae, the other families of Tanaidacea, but also other groups of Peracarida. Distribution In the distribution of the six species with a preference for greater depths, a clear split is drawn between the fauna of the north and south (Figs. 5 , 9 and 31 ). The abundant and frequent species i.e. C. igae , G. gudmundssoni , Sa. georgi, J. bioice . and L. martini , are present south of Iceland, and only H. inermis was located in northern sites. The seas surrounding Iceland are separated by the well-defined latitudinally-oriented topographic structure Greenland-Iceland-Faroe (GIF) with the deepest sill depth at 840 m between the Faeroe Islands and Scotland 22 , 96 . This ridge is known as a prominent topographic barrier in the N Atlantic that hampers distribution of water masses between the Arctic and the deep basins of the Nordic seas. The complex system of ocean currents and oceanic ridges around Iceland separates neighbouring areas, where temperature, salinity, availability of organic matter and oxygen can significantly vary 12 , 22 , 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 , and thus shape habitat mosaic affects the species compositions of benthic invertebrates 13 , 23 , 101 , 102 , 103 . Moreover, the GIF is known to hamper geneflow and hybridization effect for genetic population structure of isopods 104 . As a consequence, this distinct topographic structure becomes a distinct zoogeographical barrier shaping a region extremely sensitive to climate change 12 , 13 , 23 , 105 . The low dispersal mobility and high taxonomic diversity of the tanaidacean family Typhlotanaidae make it an excellent model in biodiversity studies and an ideal indicator in assessing the effects of anthropogenic activities. The climate change in oceanic zones will cause numerous shifts in hydrological conditions, although the scale is difficult to assess due to the marginal understanding of the biodiversity of deep-sea ecosystems. The character and the scale of disturbances caused in the ecosystems by anthropogenic activity is unpredictable, but it is assessed that the changes will be irreversible and will last for decades. Knowledge of biodiversity by integrative approaches along with the geographic distribution of newly discovered species and their environmental preferences can help protect exposed warming sites in the marine ecosystem. We are strongly convinced that the data presented here is an important piece of knowledge in the study of climate change affecting the N Atlantic. Materials and methods Sampling The 4043 typhlotanaids specimens for the research were collected during 18 expeditions, with the distribution of the stations given in Table S1 . Apart from the samples taken during the IceAGE 1 and 2 expeditions, all samples were fixed (and possibly stored) with formalin 106 , 107 . Distribution maps were prepared using the QGIS 3.28 software 108 . The environmental variables were collected from the cruise reports 106 , publications 109 , 110 and complemented from World Ocean Atlas 2020 ( https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-ocean-atlas ). The variables for the defined region have been averaged. Correlation matrix of environmental variables reveals high correlation between depth, nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and (r > 0.88, p < 0.02) thus for the species distribution only temperature and depth were considered (Fig. S2). The type-material and the other materials studied for this research are deposited in the Icelandic Museum of Natural History (Reykjavik), Kaldbak Marine Biological Laboratory (Faroe Islands), Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle (MNHM, Paris), Museum der Natur (ZMHK, Hamburg, Germany), National Museum of Scotland (NMS, Edinburgh), Natural History Museum (NHM, London), and Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (Washington DC). Morphological analyses Initial species identification was based on morphological observations with a dissecting microscope. The typhlotanaid collections were sorted to several morpho-groups, and 1918 individuals were preliminarily identified as ‘stout-bodied’ forms and were assigned for further comprehensive morphological study. From each group, several individuals were designated for thorough morphological analysis and dissected with chemically sharpened tungsten needles. The dissected cephalothorax, pereon, and pleon appendages were mounted on slides using glycerine and sealed with molten paraffin 111 . Morphological drawings were prepared using a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse 50i) equipped with a camera lucida. Digital pictures were completed using a graphic tablet following 112 . Total body length (BL) was measured along the central axis of symmetry, from the rostrum to the tip of the pleotelson. In contrast, body width was assessed perpendicular to the symmetry axis at the widest point (BW). Body width and length of cephalothorax, pereonites, pleonites, and pleotelson were measured on whole specimens. All measurements were made with ImageJ 113 . Terminology and species description Morphological terminology is largely as in Błażewicz-Paszkowycz 2007 27 . The seta types are recognized as: simple setae- without ornamentation, serrate- with serration or denticulation, penicillate- with a tuft of setules located distally and with a small knob on which seta is fixed to the tegument and chemosensory setae- slightly inflated distally and with a pore followed 73 , but is abbreviated here to PSS (penicillate/pinnate sensory seta) as used by Bird (2019) 114 , inter alia . Stout setae (L:W < 5.0) are called spines (= spiniform setae). Unspecified setae in the taxonomic descriptions are termed simple setae by default. The clinging apparatus (= prickly tubercles) is a system of various hooks, tubercles, thorns, and spines located on the carpus of pereopods 4−6 27 , 28 , 77 . The short ventral seta situated besides two long setae on the cheliped carpus is called ‘third’ seta. Błażewicz-Paszkowycz (2007) 27 proposed a classification of typhlotanaids into ‘long-bodied’ (body ≥ 8.0 L:W) and ‘short-bodied’ (body < 6.0 L:W) taxa but here are replaced by ‘slender-bodied’ ‘stout-bodied’ respectively (see the Key for Typhlotanaidae genera and morpho-groups in Błażewicz-Paszkowycz, 2007 27 ). The neuter is the post-manca stage, which cannot be classified as male or female. Two-letter genus abbreviations are used throughout the text to distinguish between genera: Tq. — Torquella, Tm. — Typhlamia, Ty. — Typhlotanais 28 , Ba. — Baratheonus , Br. — Brevitanais , St. — Starkus , Sa. — Sarsotanais , and Su .— Stuttotanais . DNA analyses Given that most specimens were conserved in formaldehyde, a final set of 40 individuals were used for molecular study. Extraction of DNA from morphologically identified neuters was performed using the Chelex (InstaGene Matrix, Bio-Rad) method as in Jakiel et al . 2020 73 and kit Sherlock AX (A&A Biotechnology) for manual isolation of genomic DNA are based on the mechanism of nucleic acid adsorption on ion exchange beads combined with the isopropanol precipitation of DNA. Vouchers specimens were recovered after extraction. The nuclear 18S rRNA region and histone H3 were PCR amplified using the primer pairs 18S 4F/2R (5′–CCA AGG AAG RCA GCA GGC ACG–3′ and 5′–GAG TCC CGT GTT GAG TCA ATT AAG C–3′) 115 , H3AF/ H3AR (5′–ATG GCT CGT ACC AAG CAG ACV GC–3′ and 5′–ATA TCC TTR GGC ATR ATR GTG AC–3′) 116 . The reaction protocol for 18S rRNA consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min., 35× reaction cycles of 95 °C for 1 min., 53.6 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 3 min., and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min, and for histone H3 at 95 °C for 3 min., 35× reaction cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 47 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min., and a final extension at 72 °C for 15 min. and for 18S rRNA at 95 °C for 2 min., 35 reaction cycles of 95 °C for 1 min., 53.6 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 3 min., and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. After Sanger sequencing (Macrogen, Netherlands), alignment were built using Geneious aligner v9.1.3 ( www.geneious.com ) and compared with the GenBank database using BLAST 117 to discard contamination from non-arthropod sources. Our newly obtained sequences and those obtained from GenBank were aligned using MAFFT and the L-INSi alignment option 118 . The 18S sequence alignment was trimmed to 964 bp and H3 to 340 bp. Phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference. Nucleotide substitution model selection was performed according to the BIC 18S: (HKY + I + G4, H3: K2 + I + G4) The Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY + I + G4) showed the lowest BIC for 18S and the Kimmura 2-parameter model (K2 + G + I) for histone H3. The Bayesian phylogeny was reconstructed using MrBayes 3.2.7 120 , 121 . Four runs of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) were performed each 10 million generations-long, sampled every 1000 generations. All runs converge with standard deviation of split frequencies below 0.0 and potential scale reduction factor reaching 1. The trees were summarised using sumt command in MrBayes with 25% “burn-in” phase removed 122 , 123 . The Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree was made in RAxML Version 8 119 , 124 . Nodal support was assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates. Patristic distances (i.e. sum of the length of all branches connecting two lineages in an evolutionary tree) were estimated using Mega version X. Morphological phylogeny analyses To investigate the phylogenetic relationships among ‘stout-bodied’ form of Typhlotanaidae, a phylogenetic analysis was performed. The matrix with 39 morphological characters and 25 species including 14 newly described species and was compiled. 24 species were classified as an ingroup. The non-typhlotanaid Akanthophoreus sp. was selected as the outgroup. The classification of Tanaidacea is based primarily on the morphology of the females, and for most species and genera the males are not known at all. Therefore, the characters used in the matrix are based on descriptions of females or neuters. Ten of the 39 characters were continuous and 25 were numerical. Numerical characters included 16 binary and 13 multistate features. Characters were unordered and unweighted. The order of the characters in the matrix corresponds approximately to the order of the appendages, counting from the beginning of the cephalothorax to the end of the pleotelson. The data matrix was prepared in Excel and was converted for use in TNT 125 . A heuristic search was conducted in TNT v 1.5 125 , 126 , 127 using a traditional search algorithm 125 (suitable for a small database) with 1000 replications and 100 trees in each replication. A tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) branch swapping algorithm was used. Consistency Index, one measure of homoplasy; it is computed as the minimum number of changes divided by the number of changes requested in the tree and ranges from 0 to 1 (CI = 1 means no homoplasy). Retention Index (RI) shows how the tree fits the character and how well the synapomorphies explain the tree; it is computed as (Max steps–Observed steps)/(max steps–min steps); RI ranges from 0 to 1, if RI = 1, the character fits ideally 128 . Branch support was computed using Bremer's Relative Support—subtrees up to 10 steps; relative fit difference of 0.9 realized in TNT 129 . Morphological characters Continuous 1.

Imaging Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images were taken with an LSM 780 (Zeiss) microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 objective using the InTune tuneable excitation laser system (set to excitation wavelength 555 nm). Specimens were stained for 24 h with an equal volume mixture of saturated water solutions of Congo red and acid fuchsin. Before dissection and mounting in 100% glycerol, stained animals were washed thoroughly with 50% aqueous glycerol solution. Fluorescence was registered in single emission channel: 561–695 nm. Images were recorded as Z-stacks with 12.6 ms pixel dwell and two times line averaging with optical cross section of 0.5 mm. Collected data were pseudo-coloured in gold and reconstructed into a 3D image stack by maximum intensity projection using ZEN software (Zeiss). The microscope is situated in the Department of Molecular Biophysics, University of Lodz, Poland. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to illustrate tiny cuticular structures such as setae. SEM imaging was performed using a Phenom Pro X Scanning Electron Microscope at the Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Hydrobiology, University of Lodz, Poland from air-dried without sputter metallic layer 28 . The body habitus was photographed with a Leica MDG41and the LAS X program.
