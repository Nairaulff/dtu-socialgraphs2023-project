introduction nocturia defined number time main sleep period patient must awake desire urinate addition patient must asleep willing sleep time patient urinates first time awakening urinate one common lower urinary tract symptom luts prevalence doe vary sex increase age nocturia reported risk factor sexual dysfunction depression metabolic syndrome addition frequent nocturia causing multiple awakening reported cause sleep deprivation poor sleep quality resulting significant reduction patient quality life qol interference daily life older adult patient nocturia shown risk factor fall fracture leading decreased patient qol worse prognosis japan population people aged year accounted 28.4 total population number japanese people aged year expected reach million phenomenon country world ever experienced therefore nocturia appears critical problem japan facing super-aging society nocturia classified according four main cause 24-h polyuria excessive urination daytime nighttime bladder storage disorder overactive bladder oab benign prostatic hyperplasia bph nocturnal polyuria various related factor including oab considered one main cause nocturia associated decreased secretion antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin avp treatment dramatically changed randomized controlled trial shown desmopressin acetate synthetic avp analog effective well-tolerated treatment

sex suggesting one common cause nocturia japanese patient despite essential need accurate diagnosis dependent etiology treat nocturia condition still considered storage symptom associated oab bph thus adequately treated therefore important use bladder diary simple effective tool identify patient primary cause nocturia current study prevalence increased advancing age significant predictor age year various reason postulated increase nocturnal urine volume age robertson reported proportion nocturnal urine volume increased older individual compared approximately total daily urine volume aged 21–35 year increase nocturnal urine volume age may due age-related physiological change renal function circadian rhythm change water electrolyte regulatory hormone indeed decreased renal concentrating capacity sodium conservation observed older adult population asplund found nocturnal serum antidiuretic hormone concentration higher younger adult subject lower older adult subject therefore change water/electrolyte-regulating hormone thought contribute increased nocturnal urine volume atrial natriuretic peptide anp also thought contribute increased nocturnal urinary output although report found difference anp level patient without shown nocturnal anp level increased patient urinary anp level higher older adult patient nocturia result suggest physiological change kidney related hormonal change may associated increased prevalence age interestingly bmi 23.0 kg/m significant predictive factor study although study examined association bmi several examined association luts nocturia bmi report indicated high bmi risk factor luts nocturia high low bmi 18.5 kg/m woman associated nocturia recent year frailty received increased attention older adult population associated increased risk fall disability hospitalization death phenotypic definition frailty comprises five physical characteristic including unintentional weight loss fact significant correlation nocturia four episode frailty polypharmacy reported 0.05 nocturia fairly common associated insomnia frailty polypharmacy incontinence fall slow walking functionality older adult woman suggested nocturia crucial geriatric practice two episode nocturia could indicator poor health older adult woman study examined relationship bmi bmi 23.0 kg/m significant predictor according multivariate analysis based result found prevalence decreased increasing bmi although clear reason result remain uncertain relationship including frailty need reconsidered future prospective study study ischemic heart cerebrovascular disease independent predictor previous report nocturia independently associated cardiovascular disease adjusting known confounders although nocturia also associated lower odds ratio presence heart failure history coronary artery disease associated nocturia association nocturia cardiovascular morbidity raise several interesting question nocturia adversely affect cardiovascular system disrupting sleep causing sleep deprivation suggested poor inadequate sleep may lead adverse cardiovascular morbidity however according previous report nocturia associated cardiovascular disease including time awake sleep onset report concluded relationship natriuretic peptide nocturia cardiovascular outcome complex requires study although nocturia decrease circulating blood volume may reduce cardiac preload patient also multifactorial etiology well urologic disease namely untreated diabetes insomnia cardiovascular disease chronic kidney disease ckd primary polydipsia identified present study also investigated various factor diabetes hypertension insomnia ckd however factor detected significant risk factor however diabetes hypertension known risk factor ischemic heart disease cerebrovascular disease addition obstructive sleep apnea known risk factor cerebrovascular disease result study suggested ischemic heart disease cerebrovascular disease might associated higher risk developing vascular disease compared diabetes hypertension might also contribute occurrence several limitation remain addressed study first retrospective multicenter study thus potential inherent bias could eliminated second nocturia examined using bladder diary recorded patient suggesting criterion assessment may consistent additionally patient may accurately recorded urine volume frequency voiding bladder diary third need examine validity cutoff value npi diagnosis adopted study definition npi commonly used patient year age definition accepted younger patient however clear definition based specific age category yet established study adopted npi definition majority enrolled patient year age suggesting clear definition based age category may necessary future fourth high proportion male patient study may require cautious interpretation result obtained study even though nocturia generally considered occur regardless gender fifth health status enrolled patient objectively assessed using screening tool older adult therefore true impact aging unclear finally unable investigate etiology perform hematological test nocturia conclusion best knowledge first large multicenter study investigate prevalence japanese patient nocturia prevalence japanese patient nocturia 67.4 independent predictor include age year bmi 23.0 kg/m presence ischemic heart disease cerebrovascular disease whether factor truly influence would need examined future prospective study large number patient
