important pillar muslim remains unclear safe patient start fasting ramadan risk fasting two recent study made recommendation religious fasting based expert consensus literature review study

fasting average food water survey reviewed patient history fasting month ramadan subsequently seen complication related sleeve gastrectomy oagb predominant procedure performed patient complication fasting followed rygb indicative international pool surgeon contributing data consistent previous report middle east region average patient resumed fasting slightly year participated fast dusk dawn

upon breaking fast dehydration reported patient kidney stone likely closely related dehydration six patient patient dehydration required hydration different type one procedure prone dehydration patient received recommendation avoid fasting seen treated level intervention required may prudent recommend short-term avoidance fasting patient require fluid develop kidney stone hydration water recommended kidney stone prevention bariatric surgery given rate dehydration care team strategize patient hydrate create schedule drinking fluid starting fast breaking fast evening abdominal pain common symptom patient history fasting could discerned chronic acute survey several reason abdominal pain fasting including risk overeating breaking fast eating food high fat sugar lead dumping syndrome patient need re-education smoking cessation many patient complication actively smoking addition education reinforcement vitamin supplementation may help prevent kidney oxalate stone best treated taking calcium supplementation calcium often broken taken three four time per day feasible full daytime fast would prudent screen patient history kidney stone begin fasting previous history increase quadruple risk stone later since kidney stone recurrence one complication patient history may need advised avoid fasting given strict hydration instruction glycemic control fasting appear common issue patient affected blood sugar variance obvious pattern would important track food log group patient understand intake eating hour medication compliance one patient insulin unclear patient taking insulin fasting diabetic patient insulin advised consult endocrinologist fasting diabetic ketoacidosis dka life-threatening complication prevented although risk dka low t2dm patient ramadan fasting risk increased excessive reduction insulin dose due fact patient avoided eating food fasting another etiology dka increasing ketogenesis gluconeogenesis result excessively breakdown glycogen due insulin deficiency fasting practical guideline diabetes ramadan recommend self-monitoring blood glucose diabetic patient break fast presence blood glucose level 300mg/dl 16.6 mmol/l diabetic patient history also advised avoid sweet high-sugar food iftar avoid dka history dka within three month ramadan considered high-risk patient may recommend avoiding fasting hyperglycemia seen patient oral medication medication compliance consuming high carbohydrate food fasting may contributed finding religious fasting remains reality many patient encounter study need continue explore adverse outcome avoided period fasting survey contributes type complication seen average 14.2 month resuming ramadan fasting however understanding medication compliance diet detail needed would helpful patient maintain diet log understand type food consumed track amount fluid intake hydration medication taken data give background risk fasting area monitor patient doe define safe patient resume fasting survey despite largest collection patient complication fasting history survey several limitation survey able determine prevalence complication differentiate certain type surgery safer offer complication rate addition would helpful vitamin level lab study understand nutritional status fasting started addition survey doe control group may answer question causality finally medical history provided condition may guide resumption fasting avoidance ideally prospectively collected database preoperative factor surgical detail postoperative information would help clarify limitation within survey summary performed globally obesity global health issue may change common religious practice like fasting patient unable fast may make untenable option need open counseling advice patient advised risk abdominal pain dehydration marginal/peptic ulcer disease exacerbation fasting review medication care team garner advice take medication work continued identify fasting done safely patient population meantime patient stay close contact weight management team period religious fasting recommendation prior commencing religious fasting advisable patient engage consultation surgeon multidisciplinary team mdt regular utilization proton pump inhibitor ppis may contemplated preventive therapeutic measure marginal ulceration fasting essential provide patient postoperative dietary recommendation promote mindful eating habit fasting serf reminder patient avoid rapid consumption encourages thorough chewing breaking fast prevent formation kidney stone following recommended maintain adequate hydration consuming water collaborate patient develop strategy effective hydration including determining appropriate timing quantity fluid intake initiating fast breaking evening patient necessitate re-education regarding smoking cessation particularly many individual experienced complication actively smoking diabetic patient insulin therapy advised consult endocrinologist embarking fasting undergone diabetic patient engage self-monitoring blood glucose level discontinue fasting reading exceed mg/dl patient history diabetic ketoacidosis dka within three month preceding ramadan period may classified high-risk individual may advisable abstain fasting diabetic patient history also encouraged refrain consuming sweet high-sugar food iftar order prevent dka
