study strength first study used pcpc assessing neurological outcome different method used previous study analysing national utstein registry reported neurological outcome paediatric ohca patient using

study comparison paediatric patient two large database prospectively collected personnel hospital staff area also limitation study first sos-kanto study include hospital kanto area therefore may selection bias towards academically focused resource-rich hospital able join sos-kanto study second procedure personnel allowed perform slightly different country particularly personnel permitted
