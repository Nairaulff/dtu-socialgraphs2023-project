introduction number birth developed country decreased due low fertility however birth rate premature infant completed week gestation increasing reason increase preterm birth include older age pregnancy increased performance infertility procedure developed country incidence preterm birth range neonatal intensive care management advanced last year thereby increasing survival rate among premature newborn however chronic respiratory disease common sequela preterm birth later life especially among extremely premature neonate bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd preterm infant susceptible

child born preterm lower incidence atopic disorder long term asthma patient born term mainly induced contact allergen however asthma preterm infant may triggered respiratory infection reduced airway size decreased lung function compared term infant preterm infant reportedly secrete respiratory cytokine may promote airway inflammation thereby predisposing asthma one study reported evidence steroid-sensitive inflammation within lung assessed fractional exhaled nitric oxide suggested possibility increased systemic elastic turnover several study reported lung function preterm infant
