setting whole tooth vibration using ultrasonic insertion tip found none investigated additional adaptation technique provided benefit term void-reduction contrary high frequency direct sonic-powered application resulted significantly higher number void class-ii cavity overall clear tendency towards increased void formation increased frequency direct sonic activation restoration class-ii cavity eacs similarly study indicate sonic-activated application might lead increased air inclusion void formation rbc restoration conceivable vibrating tip might displace honey-like flowable rbc fraction second leading sort air crater along tip rapidly collapse surface thus incorporating air within rbc forming new air inclusion increased frequency foaming effect seems intensify might explain result

due described foaming effect taking place different cavity geometry class-ii cavity larger width compared eacs 1.8–2.1 diameter could allowed greater vibration amplitude tip without contact lateral cavity wall thus rbc might displaced resulting extended collapsing air crater hence air inclusion analogous laboratory plaster vibrator indirect activation aimed loosen air inclusion vibrate surface placing ultrasonic insertion tip tooth surface next cavity margin result study show benefit technique might speculated rheological property rbc allow void move upwards surface sonication process may
