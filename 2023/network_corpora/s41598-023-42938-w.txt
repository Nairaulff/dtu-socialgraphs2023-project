introduction erwinia amylovora plant pathogenic bacterium cause fire blight disease apple pear tree historically bacterial phytopathogen led significant economic loss apple pear industry worldwide hundred year necrosis blight blossom leaf branch major symptom fire blight eventually induce death whole tree via systemic infection destructive microbe known today originated north america currently amylovora quarantine status many country outside north america therefore outbreak spread amylovora remain cause concern particularly fire-blight-free country australia japan country apple pear tree grown first outbreak amylovora reported hudson valley new york state subsequent outbreak occurring new zealand europe north africa middle east russia asia consequently major country producing exporting apple pear dedicated great effort prevent bacterial pathogen invasion monitor whereabouts turn motivated researcher working pathogen especially phytopathologists develop innovative powerful approach epidemiological investigation quarantine policy investigate prevent spread eradicate microbe country regarding genotyping amylovora strain many scientist adopted representative molecular method perform epidemiological assay including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr variable number tandem repeat vntr single-nucleotide polymorphism snp analysis large chromosomal inversion lcis caused homologous recombination method amylovora strain classified follows amygdaloideae -infecting group typically divided widely-prevalent clade comprises isolates various country eastern n.a clade western n.a clade rubus -infecting group genetically distinct group exhibit distinct protein profile last b-group strain show limited sequence identity either group however genotyping marker discriminate amylovora strain various country highly limited genome sequence identity among amylovora strain high homology 99.5 amylovora low genetic diversity compared phytopathogenic bacteria especially group group well chromosome plasmid difficult investigate genetic diversity dynamic transmission strain addition snp analysis based whole-genome sequencing wgs
