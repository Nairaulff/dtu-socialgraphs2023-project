however implementation rate lower european study european survey lupus patient 84.3 patient using hcq reported received baseline examination start hcq treatment although direct comparison study result possible european survey specify screening test method lower screening rate present study suggests necessity enhancing awareness among clinician regarding importance retinal screening hcq treatment following point need consideration interpreting difference screening rate lower screening rate analysis may due definition screening rate whereas european survey examined ever-implemented retinal screening test assessed screening rate within one year first hcq prescription one year five year continuous hcq use case hcq user screening rate within one year 8.99 assessed one-year following continuous five year hcq use screening rate 10.55 supplementary table addition lower screening rate partly due lack coverage national insurance korea fundus autofluorescence sd-oct began covered

temporarily increased best knowledge first study examine trend daily dos since identify impact aao guideline recommended hcq dose mg/kg/day could reveal trend prescription dos revising guideline using
