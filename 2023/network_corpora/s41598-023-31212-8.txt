introduction coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic infection caused newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov2 first case disease emerged wuhan china december quickly spread across globe infecting million people causing million death since covid-19 declared global pandemic several treatment tested far shown significantly decreased mortality covid-19 patient currently supportive care measure mechanical ventilation oxygenation fluid management remain standard care several class drug tested particularly patient moderate severe infection including several

corticosteroid could improve hyperinflammatory state probably associated covid-19 pneumonia use associated several potential serious adverse effect example include higher incidence hospital-acquired

improve mortality study combination corticosteroid improve mortality monotherapy remdesivir better improving time recovery reducing length hospital stay pandemic context result could useful release

however corticosteroid arm associated significantly adverse event treatment-related adverse event severe life-threatening adverse event current safety profile remdesivir still incomplete increasing evidence demonstrated covid-19 associated multiple organ involvement including lung liver gastrointestinal tract heart kidney therefore complex distinguish underlying cause adverse event remdesivir treatment study incidence adverse effect associated rdv similar observed study study randomized controlled study could therefore significant bias distribution patient treatment group however real-life study result reinforced robust structure prospectively collected data also homogeneity compared group limit potential bias analysed outcome conclusion study patient treated rdv alone shorter length hospital stay use corticosteroid adjunctive therapy rdv associated improvement mortality covid-19 patient result raise question whether corticosteroid represent real advantage treatment patient covid-19 pneumonia near future result trial could help define role rdv corticosteroid treatment covid-19 patient
