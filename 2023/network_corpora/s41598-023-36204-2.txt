introduction pleural empyema infectious disease pleural space accompanies bacterial pneumonia tuberculous empyema develops due rupture pulmonary lesion dissemination primary pulmonary disease lymph blood development cover three stage stage exudative phase stage represents fibrinopurulent phase stage iii refers organizing consolidation phase surgical management become important treatment option patient tuberculous empyema surgical method closely related disease progression chronic fibrous pleural rind cover visceral pleura parietal pleura unique feature stage iii tuberculous empyema usually treated removing thickened visceral parietal fibrous pleura using traditional method surgical open decortication especially developing country thickened fiberboard cover purulent pleural fluid forming encapsulated empyema result atelectasis clinical practice surgical opportunity mainly determined course disease time preoperative anti-tuberculous treatment however tuberculosis present variety different pathological manifestation thoracic cavity even condition postoperative complication thoracic cavity stage iii patient completely thereby making difficult determine reference value traditional pathological staging additionally surgical treatment tuberculous empyema still challenging recent year institution preoperative thoracic computed tomography scan revealed patient

reemergence western country stage tuberculous empyema case usually cured anti-tuberculosis regimen thoracic drainage thoracentesis stage transitional fibrinopurulent phase current extensive standard debridement pleural cavity surgery early improper treatment effusion lead many patient progressing stage iii empyema surgical intervention needed surgical approach sophisticated empyema treated resolved stage effect surgical approach decortication visceral parietal pleura treatment stage iii tuberculous empyema gradually becoming recognized commonly used optimum timing surgery crucial achieving better outcome nazish sikander group emphasized preoperative anti-tuberculosis therapy least six week may yield better outcome minimize morbidity however study reported range two week month preoperative anti-tuberculous treatment decortication surgery despite numerous study still considerable difference timing surgery stage iii tuberculous empyema remains controversial even patient suffer chronic tuberculous empyema pathological manifestation inconsistent making challenging determine optimal operation time relying preoperative anti-tuberculosis time course disease early organizing phase fiberboard gradually formed due pleurisy reaction visceral parietal layer thoracic cellulose necrotic deposition wrap empyema main pathological change fiberboard caseous necrosis granuloma low density although fibrous connective tissue proliferated time fibrous plate remained loose inflammatory oedema surrounding tissue aggravated adhesion still dense although image clearly present fiberboard boundary surrounding tissue clear forming two-layer structure change preventing detection low-density line imaging extension anti-tuberculosis treatment time inflammation gradually controlled esr crp decreased caseous necrosis lower density fibrous plate decrease proliferation fibrous connective tissue glass-like change higher density increase fiberboard density increase gradually focus limited inflammatory oedema capsule wall surrounding tissue gradually subsides additionally long-term atelectasis factor jointly lead narrowing costal space reduction thoracic volume thereby forming three-layer structure manifest continuous low-density line around thickened parietal fibrous pleural rind imaging density fat tissue high inflammation oedema may one reason low-density line group higher body weight group without low-density line low-density line group boundary fiberboard visceral pleura relatively clear conducive surgical dissection difference may explain significantly reduced operation time intraoperative blood loss postoperative hospital stay patient low-density line group compared without low-density line suggested low-density line group staging smaller wound lower risk faster recovery better outcome therefore recommended patient without low-density line thick fiberboard appropriately postpone operation unless special circumstance case thin fiberboard obvious lung recruitment effective drainage thoracoscopic-assisted early thoracic dissection also considered phenomenon low-density line first observed scan patient phenomenon systematically explained date article comprehensively described pre intra- postoperative condition patient without low-density line emphasized importance preoperative staging preoperative staging reflect course disease time preoperative anti-tuberculous therapy scanning external manifestation pathological change empyema operable pathological examination thus preoperative scanning considered reliable preoperative factor deciding surgical management stage iii empyema however study limitation represents stage iii tuberculous empyema single institute case data generalized open decortication still one preferred procedure developing country video-assisted thoracic surgical decortication technology gradually matured enrolled patient underwent open decortication finding provide foundation future research treatment tuberculous empyema conclusion tubercular empyema common developing country many patient progressing stage iii need decortication treatment reasonable surgical operation timing crucial better outcome minimizing intraoperative blood loss patient stage iii tubercular empyema long-term clinical practice author appearance low-density line imaging indicates inflammatory oedema fibrous plate surrounding tissue subsided fibrous plate form clear boundary visceral pleura parietal pleura diaphragm pericardium tissue patient low-density line imaging good candidate open decortication reliable effective therapeutic option patient stage iii tuberculous empyema imaging low-density line approach worthy research
