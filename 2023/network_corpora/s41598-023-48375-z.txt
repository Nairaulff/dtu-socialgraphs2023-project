introduction recently due multiple effect vitamin health status different individual become growing research topic classic effect vitamin mediated active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin enables absorption calcium intestine maintenance adequate phosphate level bone mineralization bone growth remodeling biological effect vitamin regulated vitamin receptor present tissue related calcium metabolism various study shown vitamin stored adipose tissue adipose tissue potential accumulate significant amount vitamin particularly fat mass expands overweight obesity demonstrated obese individual lower circulating concentration d25 compared non-obese individual however said body fat mass percentage body fat strong predictor vitamin status different individual initial study proposed hypothetical mechanism suggesting increased vitamin circulation obesity decrease hepatic synthesis d25 negative feedback mechanism leading decrease serum d25 assessing vitamin status reflected measuring metabolite circulation compared active form however prevalence deficiency sufficiency serum d25 varies greatly depending criterion used define including population season dietary habit ethnicity physical activity age range general dyslipidemia refers imbalance level blood lipid including triglyceride total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl-c high-density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl-c disorder recognized risk factor development atherosclerosis-related disease coronary heart disease ischemic cerebrovascular disease peripheral vascular disease various factor aging increased intake fat especially saturated trans fat decreased intake antioxidant-rich food like fruit vegetable play role etiology vitamin multiple role addition role regulating calcium homeostasis contributes maintaining human health recent year seen upward trend vitamin deficiency primary source vitamin sunlight exposure certain protein-rich food also contain vitamin however noted dietary intake alone may meet individual vitamin need observational study shown low serum vitamin level independent risk factor hypertension cardiovascular disease vitamin fat-soluble hormone naturally synthesized body subcutaneous synthesis upon exposure sunlight vitamin play crucial role maintaining health bone muscle also prevents various disease cancer diabetes cardiovascular disease autoimmune disease based available evidence vitamin deficiency directly associated mortality patient cardiovascular disease cvd improving vitamin status reported reduce risk myocardial infarction stroke multiple study dyslipidemia one major risk factor developing cvd significant association found serum vitamin level lipid profile according conducted study although multiple mechanism proposed explain effect vitamin lipid profile impact vitamin blood lipid level still clear proposed mechanism suggest vitamin may directly affect serum lipid profile including triglyceride total cholesterol ldl cholesterol increasing production bile salt reducing activity lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase well indirectly influence calcium absorption resulting decreased fat absorption increased synthesis hepatic bile acid cholesterol considering vital role mentioned serum vitamin level inferred improving serum vitamin level may significant role improving associated condition hyperlipidemia affected individual therefore aim investigate relationship vitamin level blood lipid level study patient confirm method carried accordance relevant guideline regulation experimental protocol approved

vitamin cardiovascular risk biomarkers including atherogenic lipid profile vitamin deficiency common effectively treated dietary supplementation however role supplementation modifying cardiovascular risk well-established unclear whether vitamin status causally related disease simply health indicator importance physician general population due increasing use over-the-counter vitamin supplement vitamin deficiency highly prevalent associated dyslipidemia cardiovascular disease impact correcting vitamin deficiency blood lipid cardiovascular risk factor remains unknown study aimed investigate level vitamin blood lipid profile predictive factor cardiovascular disease purpose 15,600 individual average age 43.79 year visiting tehran islamic azad university hospital examined according study result mean serum level vitamin 20.79 31.40 ng/ml serum level vitamin ng/ml 16.7 individual 21–40 ng/ml 57.13 individual 41–60 ng/ml 13.5 individual additionally serum level vitamin ng/ml 2.12 individual study faridi al. also demonstrated individual vitamin deficiency relevant current study furthermore study kumaratne al. vitamin level estimated normal individual study conducted khoo al. vitamin level estimated ng/ml individual within scope present study upon reviewing foreign literature found level vitamin iran differ significantly country furthermore significant difference serum level vitamin total cholesterol men woman study conducted asmi al. shown observed relationship change blood cholesterol vitamin level stratified gender consistent current study additionally study abdi al. demonstrated significant relationship serum vitamin level total cholesterol woman applicable present study according result investigation significant relationship observed serum vitamin level triglyceride hdl total cholesterol however increase serum vitamin level associated decrease ldl finding inconsistent study ponda al. demonstrated increase vitamin level lead increase hdl study kumaratne al. high vitamin level associated decrease ldl line present study additionally study asmi showed ldl level lower individual without vitamin deficiency compared vitamin deficiency contrary study kim indicated significant relationship vitamin level cholesterol ldl hdl triglyceride level significantly higher individual vitamin deficiency consistent finding present study furthermore study conducted rossouw al. significant relationship observed change blood lipid vitamin level contradicts finding current study study keshvari al. significant relationship found vitamin level triglyceride aligns present study epidemiological evidence primarily based relevant study suggests role higher level vitamin protecting cardiovascular disease however level evidence doe establish causal relationship convincing evidence available inform clinical practice cross-sectional analysis large laboratory database provide valuable tool addressing unresolved health question although longitudinal study longer follow-up period likely yield informative finding serial testing clinical practice currently provide evidence lack association vitamin lipid contrary cross-sectional association vitamin level healthier lipid profile increasing vitamin level deficiency optimal range group neither improves worsens lipid profile suggests higher level vitamin may simply serve passive marker better cardiovascular health conclusion result study demonstrate significant relationship serum 25-hydroxyvitamin level triglyceride total cholesterol however decrease ldl level increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin level although study conducted large sample size evidence needed substantiate theory necessary conduct similar research group individual autoimmune metabolic cardiovascular infectious disease patient especially viral infection provide additional support hypothesis
