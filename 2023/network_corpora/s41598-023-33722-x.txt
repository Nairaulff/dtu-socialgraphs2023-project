hypertension instance patient t2dm increased peripheral arterial resistance caused vascular remodeling increased body fluid volume associated hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance-induced hyperglycemia addition recent study identified glp1r glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor expression carotid body cbs spontaneously hypertensive rat novel signaling circuit mediate hyperglycemia-induced peripheral chemoreflex sensitization sympathetic overactivity eventually exacerbate hypertensive condition study need research since data sourced secondary data released bpjs based patient visitation need description primary characteristic hence patient participate national health insurance scheme may recorded although study involved cities/districts south sulawesi province also important note province consisted small number cities/districts regard study utilize individual patient-level data aggregate grid cell instance instead cities/districts may generate specific high-risk area stronger reliable statistical analysis given t2dm hypertension asymptomatic early stage people visit health care facility phenomenon indeed would documented health insurance record conclusion geospatial analysis patient t2dm hypertension carried study two geospatial analyzes carried namely spatial cluster analysis spatial regression analysis globally number t2dm hypertension case registered bpjs kesehatan tended occur randomly result spatial regression analysis showed prevalence t2dm increase number hypertension data may used policy maker plan comprehensive program reduce prevalence risk complication
