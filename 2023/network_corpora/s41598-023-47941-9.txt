introduction gestational weight gain gwg potentially modifiable factor prevent occurrence adverse maternal infant outcome including small-for-gestational-age sga large-for-gestational-age lga japan country one lowest birth weight world one reason thought high prevalence woman classified underweight strict weight management gwg result japanese society obstetrics gynecology jsog raised gwg target

majority japan shortly new guidance issued gwg growth chart containing upper lower limit gwg gestational age recently developed however effectiveness using chart yet verified generally gwg advice

optimal gwg range according bmi recently raised address issue present result suggest uniform 3-kg gwg increase among underweight normal weight woman may unintentionally increase proportion lga 3.4 large increment surprising gwg regression coefficient abruptly elevated higher bwga quantile fig finding support importance recognizing unequal effect gwg across birth-weight quantile distribution gwg management clinical practice important ass whether weight gain within adequate range throughout pregnancy using recently developed gwg chart present study first analyzed whether adequacy gwg

week reported weight gain mid-to-late gestation associated increased risk low birth weight and/or macrosomia therefore considered reasonable conduct hypothetical experiment evaluate strategy gwg

including gwg various bwga distribution quantiles table second strength study performed shortly new gwg guideline published dissemination present result might help prevent clinician focusing increased gwg target increase lga may unintentionally brought attention paid increase gwg according pre-pregnancy bmi adhering new guidance third used unique approach evaluating effect hypothetical strategy advantage taking approach allows judge whether strategy good bad without conduct difficult large-scale trial real life however study also limitation amount weight gain increased new japanese guidance hypothetical weight change intervention analyzed specific rationale value reality may difficult manage weight gain loss throughout entire gestation period however even 3-kg value different unequal gwg effect across birth-weight distribution would still therefore nevertheless conclude focusing solely raising gwg would ultimately change trend increasing lga research therefore necessary verify sga lga rate change result weight control new guideline addition although took advantage large-scale perinatal database included multiple factor associated birth weight analysis data related factor e.g socioeconomic status available database therefore included conclusion although raising gwg target important step optimizing birth weight japan sufficient quantile regression analysis suggest assessing
