introduction study explains new universal statistical law recently discovered regarding booking curve time series year perishable asset industry comprising hotel airline ticketing utilized revenue management manage inventory finite sale horizon maximize profit application field diverse car rental golf cruise line railway ticket theme park cumulative time series booking represent booking curve traditionally primary subject effort directly relates occupancy forecasting critical issue case airline ticket improvement forecasting accuracy reported increase sale 0.5–3 therefore use booking curve forecasting widely studied many researcher professional perishable asset industry led development several advanced highly accurate forecasting model including exponential smoothing stochastic process model generalized linear mixed model method utilizing neural net incorporate seasonal day-of-week trend parameter however mistiming launch measure due people booking pattern shift issue professional face since fundamental idea sell right product right price right time professional need understand timing people booking change shift demand-supply environment ensure effective use advanced forecasting conjoint analysis manager indicates factor likely affect performance pricing typical measure appropriate timing booking window therefore important measure change booking curve quantitatively booking window shift ensure performance general cause change booking curve divided micro factor macro factor micro-environmental factor studied incorporated daily forecasting model including seasonality trend day week pricing promotion macro-environmental factor posed challenge professional considering appropriate timing taking measure include factor e.g. development technology economic condition people preference hotel airline ticketing industry reported complex grow shrink booking window shift occurred due spread technology booking window shrunk due extreme delay decision-making covid-19 pandemic find appropriate opportunity sell product right price timing professional required analyze complex booking window shift occur gradually rapidly due macro-environmental factor word essential information understand macroscopic change booking curve industry property due changing time take full advantage sophisticated forecasting algorithm study therefore focus booking curve use day unit conventional forecasting modeling choose month year unit time evaluate booking window shift provide explanation summarizes effect change demand-supply environment people booking pattern based background analyzed actual sale data provided six properties—three hotel car rental industries— whose data acquisition period two year including period covid-19 pandemic studied average booking curve new statistical series defined average time series booking curve period explain new universal statistical law characterized exponential function called abcdef average booking curve draw exponential function law overview abcdef law section present overview abcdef law booking curve time series exists capacity-constrained asset perishable asset industry hotel airline ticket car rental golf cruise line theater seat defined study cumulative time series booking toward deadline finite sale horizon strictly speaking two type definition booking curve study

besides daily forecasting new statistic based averaged property booking curve provide information people booking timing pattern change depending various factor e.g. economic environment preference pricing promotion thus statistic facilitate professional take measure appropriate timing literature review literature review mainly focus booking curve window closely tied booking curve represents cumulative time series number booking booking window thus booking window shift time-series pattern booking curve also change history booking curve used one important element forecasting whose objective maximize revenue finite sale horizon perishable asset industry history originates yield management control allocation finite inventory airline industry united state due deregulation pricing 1970s subsequently yield management derives fundamental idea right product right price right time become part public research theme since late 1980s many model business instance report illustrated past year various perishable asset industry study airline ticket among showed improvement accuracy quantity demand forecasting led 0.5–3 increase revenue based argument booking curve directly related occupancy forecasting play important role management past research difficult expand actual sale data could obtained due confidentiality issue however commonly available data analysis increasing booking curve represent cumulative time series booking two type defined previous study gross general on-hand demand-based booking curve net demand-based booking curve divided type compile cancellation data former show actual observation number time word includes lost booking observation day due cancellation latter doe include canceled booking booking data recorded finally presented former generally used study realistic situation forecasting contrast latter often used estimate imaginary demand might achieved without constraint limited inventory case selling commonality booking curve used predicting actual imaginary number booking deadline based historical current dynamic time-series data forecasting model various one proposed using booking curve booking process traditional representative forecasting model exponential smoothing including expansion recent study various approach stochastic process model including poisson process negative binomial process generalized linear mixed model neural net pick algorithm advance booking model proposed since versatile spread various perishable asset industry vertical advance dealing peculiar parameter field various sophisticated forecasting model using booking curve developed become clear utility booking curve mainly biased towards forecasting purpose industry affect booking curve macroscopic change booking curve people booking window shift two side coin general influence booking window shift divided macro factor technology development change economic condition micro factor seasonality day-of-the-week trend pricing sale channel allocation promotion particular technology one macro factor e.g. adoption online agency mobile apps operation system made possible consumer make booking anytime anywhere enabled strategy pricing professional thereby technology resulted booking window shift complex characteristic like grow shrink evaluation change average lead day booking used measure booking window shift example reported high average lead day observed vacation low average lead day caused delayed booking strategic consumer last-minute discount caused unfulfilled inventory covid-19 pandemic also caused booking window shift various industry including airline ticketing reported people booking window delayed due uncertainty anomalous infection risk establishment model provide enough information regarding
