introduction outbreak coronavirus disease covid-19 caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 first detected wuhan china december since virus spread across world prompting world health organization designate pandemic covid-19 situation report-51 published march date million people infected sars-cov-2 5.4 million soul lost covid-19 globally number increasing daily diagnosis one important pillar pandemic response measure high quality testing measure critical effective quarantine measure travel restriction contact tracing several factor limiting sars-cov-2 diagnosis high contagious rate asymptomatic infection warrant 40.5 total infection thus clinical symptomatic diagnosis covid-19 effective pandemic testing method higher sensitivity great importance furthermore adequate patient care cleanliness protocol hospital critical limiting nosocomial spread among patient healthcare worker pandemic however pose unprecedented challenge institution performing diagnostic testing public health patient care depend rapid reliable result quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction qrt-pcr gold standard detection sars-cov-2 distinct qrt-pcr testing protocol swiftly established made publicly available center disease control cdc usa date food drug administration fda usa issued emergency use authorization eua covid-19 molecular diagnostic kit combating pandemic however many qrt-pcr kit exhibit lower sensitivity creates possibility providing false negative result use moreover factor might also lead false negative result low viral load play significant role therefore necessary improve analytical sensitivity ensure accuracy reliability test result specificity confirmatory test relies probe target sequence commercially available rrt-pcr kit generally target spike nucleocapsid envelope rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp gene sars-cov-2 already published however various mutation observed within region might hamper sensitivity furthermore several probe primer utilized multi-step pcr procedure commercial kit time-consuming may complicate result interpretation given current scarcity reagent manpower equipment single gene qrt-pcr method high sensitivity specificity would useful combating sars-cov-2 pandemic optimized method diagnostic preemptive testing vital avoiding worst-case scenario search promising alternative
