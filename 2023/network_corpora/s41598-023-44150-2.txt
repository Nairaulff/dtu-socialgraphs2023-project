introduction femoral neck fracture frequent pathology seen elderly population group patient often present multiple co-morbidities complex social requirement prolonged length hospital stay leading associated high mortality rate major healthcare cost factor pointed national database study like macaulay reviewing 350,000 case population bandhari 280,000 country nikitovic published cost managing single patient ontario femoral neck fracture 39,479 dollar first year 10,347 dollar second year mortality rate femoral neck fracture around 1st year following fracture timing fracture surgery appears key point reducing mortality simunovic reported significantly lower mortality morbidity rate study surgery performed early recent study evaluating question hip attack lancet described comparable mortality rate surgery performed first trauma twenty strong evidence literature support use total hip arthroplasty tha provide better patient reported outcome measure prom compared hemiarthroplasty ongoing debate regarding influence choice implant mortality rate wang found lower mortality rate tha group compared group patient displaced neck femur fracture lewis performed meta-analysis including patient difference mortality rate two implant option lower mortality rate found study utilizing tha may explained lower pre-operative co-morbidities level finally literature doe provide strong evidence use cemented versus uncemented stem femoral neck fracture surgery kumar find difference meta-analysis included study patient whereas richardson described higher mortality rate uncemented stem

femoral neck fracture uncemented femoral stem within admission look protective attitude reduce mortality rate concerning timing fracture surgery simunovic published meta-analysis obvious reduction mortality risk timing fracture surgery reduced lewis waddel performed review literature found delay surgery asa patient adversely affect patient outcome large randomized controlled trial published hip

living reduced mortality study hazard ratio 0.762 mean patient protected death every thousand surgery surgeon chooses total hip arthroplasty even though population tha difficult compare group older present comorbidities tha group multivariate analysis allows get rid bias concerning difference population consensus literature concerning use cement femoral stem fixation nantha kumar performed meta-analysis study including patient comparing cemented versus cementless stem fixation found reduced risk intra- post-operative peri-prosthetic fracture cemented arthroplasty group difference term mortality comparison richardson described increased risk mortality linked use cementless femoral stem study found increased incidence revision surgery cementless stem group associated higher rate mortality literature review published chen explains choice using cement must based bone quality comorbidity profile age based finding increased risk mortality cemented stem fixation every thousand surgery performed patient would potentially saved cementless fixation two reason could explain higher mortality rate associated cement first physiological reaction induced cement including hypersensitivity lung reaction could cause death second surgeon could choose use cement due poor bone quality low bone quality could associated decrease overall condition could create selection bias
