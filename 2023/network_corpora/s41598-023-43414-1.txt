homocysteine hcy affected genetics age vitamin folic acid vitamin factor mainly used clinical risk prediction cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease recent research linked elevated hcy level decreased bone density relative risk fracture increase increased serum hcy concentration according study high hcy may affect bone matrix diminish bone quality inhibiting cross-linking collagen fiber hindering
