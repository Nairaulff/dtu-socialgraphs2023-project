introduction livestock production robustness defined animal ability maintain production resilient perturbation allowing high production many different environment robustness critical issue poultry breeding implication profitability health wellbeing intense selection production trait well-established relationship reduced robustness trade-off robustness production described resource allocation theory state resource individual limited allocation resource optimize individual fitness environment breeding increased production e.g. breast yield believed compromise robustness increase behavioural physiological immunological disorder traditionally change housing management used try reduce problem strategy improve poultry robustness breeding also suggested common strategy include reaction norm analysis direct selection robustness-related trait like disease resistance leg health another strategy incorporate robustness animal breeding investigate genetics hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal hpa axis hpa axis connected robustness pivotal role regulating energy balance influencing e.g. behaviour appetite adaptation inflammatory response neuroendocrine stress response poultry higher hpa axis activity demonstrated genetic line resistant disease/parasites resilient environmental challenge .domestication intense selection production trait livestock tends result reduced hpa axis activity meaning lower level glucocorticoid produced past year shift interpret glucocorticoid level animal specifically challenging assumption low glucocorticoid level indicate animal healthy well low hpa axis

metabolism modern productive poultry line tend lower hpa axis activity compared traditional line wild relative suggests traditional line robust resilient genetically selected line meaning production potential not/minimally compromised perturbation e.g. environmental change disease challenge faster growing line turkey observed sensitive perturbation compared smaller slower-growing line response e.g. transport stress coli challenge indicated greater body weight loss mortality trade-off productivity robustness explained resource allocation theory brief energetic resource individual limited selection increased production allocates resource production trait e.g. muscle growth leaf fewer resource functional trait related robustness resilience moreover primary role glucocorticoid like corticosterone mobilize energy protein catabolism since high level protein catabolism would detrimental muscle growth meat yield selection production favor protein anabolism therefore logical higher meat yield would unfavorably correlated fcort relationship also found several experimental study elevated corticosterone level result decreased meat yield poultry theunfavourable phenotypic correlation observed fcort breast yield trait −0.23 −0.17 present study finally significant positive partial phenotypic correlation fcort drum weight walking indicates bird higher fcort better walking ability leg conformation perhaps due proportioned/heavier drum compared bird low fcort may relate selection rapid growth heavier breast weight resulting structural problem leg poor posture suited walking standing however finding replicated genetic correlation need research larger sample size test hypothesis also positive genetic correlation fcort ultimate ultimate influenced amount muscle glycogen broken lactic acid post-mortem decrease muscle glucocorticoid like corticosterone mobilize energy glycogenolysis i.e. breaking muscle glycogen glucose high glucocorticoid level thus glycogenolysis would lower level glycogen available muscle slaughter broken lactic acid consequently meat would decrease much explaining positive correlation fcort ultimate relationship could desirable consequence selection higher fcort may help reduce prevalence quality defect pale soft exudative pse meat associated low meat correlation fcort ultimate may also influenced negative

understanding fault bar development different trait definition would result different outcome finally above-mentioned issue resolved uptake trait industrial breeding program relies clear communication cost–benefit analysis ensuring balanced breeding goal considering relationship existing trait need clear communication cost potential benefit throughout lifecycle bird especially important unfavourable correlation fcort/fault bar highly economically important trait like breast meat yield necessary demonstrate selection i.e. fcort reduce gain breast trait benefit selecting fcort i.e.
