introduction covid-19 pandemic started caused severe crisis society economy fight dissemination virus many state implemented policy measure social-distancing rule access restriction lockdown compliance measure important prerequisite healthy society functioning educational system labor market however compliance well behavior related pandemic situation reflect social dilemma negative externality affect whole society citizen cooperate example relate break-down health-care system loss human capital labor market many people become seriously ill due unlimited spread virus short-run missing worker lower output causing gap supply chain high economic cost industry society potential long-term effect covid-19 infection increase cost society battle covid-19 vaccine promising candidate become game changer protect vaccinated person infection serious course disease hospitalization also provide positive externality society high vaccination rate may curb spread virus however many country face problem vaccination rate low august usa germany according world data important reason insufficient vaccination rate country low degree acceptance covid-19 vaccine among citizen summer winter 2021/2022 many german federal government introduced policy offering access public area e.g. bar restaurant fitness center vaccinated eimpft recovered previous covid-19 infection enesen case alternatively tested negative etestet case furthermore boostered people offered shorter quarantine time exemption need negative covid-19 test access location 2g+ rule behavioral economics perspective policy may interpreted vaccination incentive experimental evidence show financial incentive may increase vaccination rate real hypothetical scenario however little known success restriction policy determinant people vaccination motivation therefore better understanding needed help design policy increase vaccination motivation paper fill research gap survey study göttingen lower saxony germany analyzes determinant vaccination motivation people want get vaccinated precisely surveyed people approached two mobile vaccination center göttingen offered first-come-first-serve basis without

subject motivation conducted study shortly introduction 2g+ rule december around introduction exemption boostered people need negative test 2g+ rule december lower saxony growing literature applies survey study vaccine acceptance find curbed increased distrust politics science citizen belief conspiracy theory lack information covid vaccine moreover observed woman lower vaccine acceptance afraid side effect men people show lower acceptance vaccine hypothetically assessing scenario compulsory vaccination although literature add important insight determinant vaccination shortcoming study rely hypothetical answer whether people intend get vaccinated unknown whether really vaccinated strength study surveying people waiting line vaccination center shortly receive vaccine know likely received vaccine otherwise asked people vaccination intention answer might subject desirability bias get rid bias study face selection bias sample excludes vaccination refusers participation bias common problem however may also occur many large survey study covid-19 uptake following two study showing economic preference predict people behavior pandemic elicit subject risk tolerance trust patience

personal freedom result altruistic risk tolerant people want get vaccinated want vaccine reason getting access restricted area people contact people risk people strong personal experience covid-19 motivated reason model highlight significantly positive coefficient pc4 risk tolerant effect becomes pronounced though adding control thus peer-pressure motif matter risk-tolerant people model find

subject whereas important current former student discussion time pandemic key goal avoidance high infection rate order prevent congestion hospital lack human capital labor market report based data suggests one-per-thousand increase infection caused two-to-three-percent drop local employment korea thus vaccine fighting spread virus central mean guarantee economic growth covid-19 pandemic paper studied individual motif get vaccinated determinant applying economic preference individual compliance voting behavior advantage approach interviewed people waiting line mobile vaccination center ultimately decided get vaccinated attenuates problem social desirability bias find economic preference compliance predictor citizen confidence vaccine motivation receive identify risk-averse compliant people showing high confidence vaccine moreover risk attitude explains motivation receive covid-19 vaccine protect others virus newer variant omicron true female participant particularly motivated protection issue contrast risk-tolerant altruistic people attracted policy granting access restricted area receive vaccine status effect finally result reveal trusting people participate voter turnout affected fear vaccine side effect limitation study focus rather small sample people approaching vaccination center receive vaccine mainly encompasses current former student therefore sample excludes vaccination refusers complicates generalization result consequence policy implication hold people principle ready become vaccinated derive tailored policy implication data needed nevertheless result pca add interesting first insight correlation preference people definitely want vaccine motivation increase generalizability evidence particular data vaccination refusers needed although student might representative whole population represent important age cohort documented least compliant corona regulation thus focus age cohort importance vaccination campaign behavior student important firm represent age group pretty close enter labor market student subject pool advantage homogeneous therefore prone measurement error shown large study behavior correlate representative population another limitation result correlational result draw causal relation however finding used policymakers decision-makers firm address prediction problem people ready receive vaccine respect decision-makers identify characteristic people certain region firm target tailored policy suppose knowledge significantly positive correlation risk tolerance motivation people ready receive vaccine reason getting access case decision-makers firm may use insight together data represents risk attitude branch department predicting attract employee offering vaccination incentive grant access certain payment scheme since problem one predicting right target policy policymaker doe need know cause-and-effect relation risk tolerance vaccination motive getting access instance increase motivation people principle ready become vaccinated regularly refresh vaccine firm may offer access bonus payment conditional potential recipient recently vaccinated moreover positive correlation compliance information vaccine motive become vaccinated protective reason add insight firm federal state suggests information campaign may help convince compliant people mostly vaccine refusers become regularly vaccinated however care taken design information campaign promoting information vaccine effectiveness safety since may lead adverse effect regarding people willingness comply public-health guideline information campaign may meaningful region characterized lower incidence level labor market information may help increase motivation becoming regularly vaccinated employee vaccination refusers work non-financial branch e.g. care facility employee typically characterized lower appetite risk moreover gender effect add interesting insight suggesting information campaign may particularly successful branch department high share female worker vaccination refusers finding mark promising first step better understanding determinant vaccination motif people principle ready receive vaccine believe insight may stimulate research predictive power economic preference individual behavior allow policymakers target tailored policy public economics labor market improved public policy based non-monetary incentive increase vaccination rate may work gentle rule enforcement gentle rule enforcement may interesting alternative considered recent debate introduction compulsory covid-19 vaccination germany start debate triggered emotional discussion seems potential divide society possible path future research elaboration motif vaccine hesitancy underlying determinant
