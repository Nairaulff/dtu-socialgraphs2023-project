etiology pathogenesis acute mbd remain unclear nutritional metabolic disorder caused long-term alcohol consumption considered pathogenesis patient study chronic alcoholic recent drunkenness might predisposing factor acute onset direct neurotoxicity alcohol damage callosal myelin mbd one cytotoxic lesion corpus callosum cloccs kind secondary cytokinopathy alcoholism produce glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity sodium–potassium pump aquaporins cell-cytokine interaction pathologically present intramyelinic cytotoxic edema myelin swelling demyelination dwi optimal sequence detect cytotoxic

global neural interaction long time extensive cytotoxic damage mbd considered irreversible necrotic cavitation subtypes achieved complete clinico-radiologic recovery study although type lower moca score admission indicated acute mbd potential reversibility regardless extent cytotoxic involvement rapid reversibility lesion suggested transient intramyelinic edema rather demyelination rapid remyelination possible addition relatively young patient mean age 46.2 6.3 year might good resilience type dwi hyperintensity extra-callosum anterior corpus callosum disappeared sooner splenium may associated different degree damage splenium contains glutamate excitatory receptor susceptible excitotoxicity furthermore explained reversible splenial lesion syndrome resles proposed carcia-monco clinical-imaging syndrome cytotoxic edema possible pathological basis resles also divided two subtypes resles common focally involving splenium resles rarer extensively involving callosal extracallosal structure resles resles may explain longitudinal imaging change acute mbd effective treatment imaging pattern type first changed resles resles eventually lesion undetectable however investigation resles yet reached consensus type especially extracallosal involvement indicates severe symptom slow recovery poor prognosis however found extent restricted diffusion moca score admission affect prognosis acute mbd clinico-radiologic typing heinrich mainly based earlier literature review 1985–2003 possible selection bias relying t2wi evaluate callosal edema acute mbd could bring misjudgment non-standardized outcome early diagnosis timely treatment significantly improve prognosis acute mbd dwi reveal earlier lesion wider distribution acute mbd combination vitamin corticosteroid effective b-vitamin deficiency reduce neurotrophic neurometabolic level early supplement high-dose thiamine neuroreparative treatment continuous compound vitamin oral administration beneficial nourishing nerve inhibiting recurrence preventing complication direct neurotoxicity alcohol corticosteroid pulse therapy alleviate brain edema inhibit demyelination reduce inflammatory reaction given combination corticosteroid vitamin difficult determine one play major role treatment however negative effect combined treatment reported indeed drunkenness might affect initial moca score however elevation follow-up confirmed continuous recovery patient retrospective study dwi acquired different scanner directly compare adc value radc could reduce measurement bias extent invasive biopsy feasible acute mbd therefore multimodal imaging larger sample size best way explore pathogenesis although patient group clear history alcohol consumption recent drunkenness could rule possibility cytotoxic lesion corpus callosum drunkenness also affect moca score confuse clinical evaluation admission advanced imaging method available retrospective analysis dwi sufficient meet qualitative quantitative need due low incidence acute mbd small sample size limited statistical reliability multi-modal imaging research larger sample necessary conclusion acute mbd always fatal complete recovery possible early diagnosis reasonable treatment key point clinico-radiologic typing heinrich absolute evaluation prognosis extent callosal involvement related severity early symptom
