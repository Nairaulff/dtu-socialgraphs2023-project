introduction malnutrition child expressly detrimental damage physical cognitive development early childhood largely irretrievable wide range cognitive deficit reported malnourished child malnutrition linked suboptimal brain development negative impact cognitive development educational achievement economic productivity later life childhood maturation specific brain area associated development specific cognitive function language reading memory synaptic density reach high level brain growth childhood age brain myelination regulates higher cognitive function persists well adolescence genetic program determines person brain develops modified environment including nutrition study demonstrated link good nutrition optimal brain function healthy nutrition supplementation play critical role cell proliferation dna replication neurotransmitter hormone metabolism essential component enzyme system throughout brain early childhood brain grows quickly rest body could make susceptible nutritional deficit one factor affecting cognitive development nutrition early childhood may especially vulnerable nutritional deficiency due rapid brain growth throughout period child malnourished higher mortality morbidity rate preschooler impaired cognitive development predictive later school achievement education increase one human capital knowledge resource skill eventually determine health well-being poor motor cognitive development lower educational attainment economic output higher chance developing metabolic illness impact productivity adulthood public health concern study reported poor motor skill adaptive behavior language social skill development among malnourished child malnutrition also linked deficit memory visuomotor coordination social skill also decreased score associated severity malnutrition despite effort national international obligation knowledge gap caregiver remain cause nutritional status child affect physical growth cognitive development considering

performed poorly task requiring attention working memory learning memory visuospatial ability study found cognitive skill working memory visual construction learning memory malnourished child developed per age compared adequately nourished child support current study finding another study child malnutrition obtained lower social quotient score normal child effect noticeable stunted wasted child poor communication socialisation skill additionally malnutrition significant relationship immediate delayed memory higher absenteeism falling sick poor school performance found among filipino child significant improvement cognitive development preschool child observed implementing community-based nutrition intervention intervention developed delivered context-specific affordable rural population mother exhibited enthusiasm preparing variety nutritious food readily available affordable family also observed improvement nutritional status among child community-based study indonesia reported improvement growth development child systematic review effectiveness early childhood intervention promoting cognitive development revealed implementation comprehensive program cognitive development effective intervention child-focused education stimulation parent-focused support income supplementation nutrition health intervention effective improving cognitive development child food prepared mother promote weight gain cognitive development mother find food source based local availability child prefer local food prepared mother nutrition education intervention improve child growth parameter overall development including cognitive development intervention implemented within integrated child development scheme icds framework mother provide nutritious diet child within socioeconomic capability strength study outcome assessor blinded study group performed outcome assessment cognitive development outcome measurement cognitive development assessed long duration i.e. end six month month intervention group limitation study study included preschool child mother registered anganwadi centre selected village udupi taluk intervention control group differed term parent educational level researcher could control study adopted cluster randomization conclusion malnutrition among child impact cognitive development thus caregiver must made aware effect malnutrition cognitive development able identify deficit early take corrective measure parenting related feeding practice first five year life closely related stimulating child overall growth development
