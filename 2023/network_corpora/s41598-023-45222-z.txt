pathophysiological pathway including multi-organ injury vascular wall injury activation inflammatory coagulation pathway may explain multiple clinical manifestation prominent difference seen term incidence increase risk thrombotic event covid-19 well described data show covid-19 particularly increased risk woman comparison covid-negative counterpart result may suggest covid-19 initiate sex-specific pathway cause greater thrombotic activation woman men noteworthy finding contradictory prior study suggested higher incidence thrombotic event men noted patient covid-19 positive frequently symptom heart failure stem various factor firstly covid-19 heart failure partially overlapping symptomatology e.g occurrence dyspnea therefore patient suffering either covid-19 prone present exacerbated respiratory symptom furthermore aforementioned covid-19 driven thrombotic activation may lead massive resulting greater coronary artery occlusion thus—more symptomatic manifestation disease trend toward exacerbated myocardial infarction covid-19 could seen based data since higher proportion stemi covid-19 patient compared patient infected covid-19 although finding statistically significant trend observed among patient suffering nstemi finally neurohormonal activation reduced oxygen saturation accompanying covid-19 may deepen cardiovascular decompensation caused change cardiovascular disease pattern sex-specific change pattern cardiovascular event period different seek medical care acknowledged possibly managed digital health solution and/for information medical personell patient better stratify disease avoid disease severity limitation several limitation study mentioned first collect longer-term follow-up mortality information data focused specific department centre report mortality rate recurrent myocardial infarction event could provide detailed insight long-term covid-19 complication among cardiac patient moreover studied population although large prospective characterized limited data collection example include data regarding disease severity history chronic disease affecting organ system consequence comprehensive multi-organ disease characteristic participant considered finally data gathered first phase covid-19 pandemic contemporary sars-cov-2 strain impact vaccination treatment steroid anticoagulant antiviral could impact
