introduction bambara groundnut vigna subterranea verdc annual legume belonging family fabaceae subfamily faboidea genus vigna seed quality pod color texture leaf shape plant vigor nutritional anti-nutritional quality crop differ one variety another said originated west africa chad central african republic nigeria cameroon crop also found tropical part like america australia asia level cultivation low bambara groundnut rank third common essential crop behind peanut arachis hypogea cowpea vigna unguiculata africa classified globally world trading scheme underutilized researcher paid little attention crop rank production percentage low crop said underutilized often regarded poor man crop and/or woman crop simply pre-field field post-field activity often performed woman also grown subsistence level meet family immediate need however recently noticed declared crop new millennium due characteristic richness nutrient resilient climate change used different way processed diverse food product different people culture across different location grown recorded setback use bambara seed hard-to-cook hard-to-mill challenge often lead extended cooking time adequate softening texture consumption achieved also contributing low adoption bambara many farmer lack practicing modern production technique fact breeder still use local variety natural breed crop green freshly harvested groundnut cooked spice salt often consumed west african although mazahib reported method shorten length cooking crop source major concern researcher farmer result survey revealed seed could roasted soaked pretreatment mean milling flour combat hard-to-cook problem also previous survey soaking roasting seed employed bypass hard-to-mill challenge bambara groundnut reportedly found highly nutritious compared legume preferred food crop many local people people afford buy valuable animal protein product bambara groundnut processed many end product harvesting using different method used adult baby food supplement higher rate acceptance soybean cowpea milk many part bambara plant used animal feed tropic rich protein contributing world protein congo oil extracted bambara seed aside nutritional benefit bambara also diverse health benefit range used cure diarrhea prevent high blood pressure treat wound heal epilepsy control vomiting pregnancy chewed swallowed bambara nut leguminous crop highly rich nutrient referred complete balanced diet due high carbohydrate content 49–64.5 protein 15–25.5 fat 4.5–7.4 fiber 5.2–6.4 ash 3.2–4.4 mineral also contains micronutrient 11.45–19.35 mg/100 5.1–9.2 mg/100 2.9–12.0 mg/100 95.8–99 mg/100 present seed biochemical investigation also carried revealed bambara groundnut contains nonessential amino acid 66.69 essential amino acid 33.31 like leguminous crop help fix atmospheric nitrogen soil bambara groundnut drought-resistant thrive well area nutrient-poor soil even crop fail safeguard future food dietary need face climate change due crop intrinsic resistance stress small-scale subsistence farmer situation low agricultural input like fertilizer pesticide production bambara groundnut still thrive well root bambara groundnut help fix nitrogen soil thereby replenishing repairing nutrient soil attribute make highly suitable rotated intercropped rice maize millet yam cassava mention leaf crop rich nitrogen potassium also render suitable animal feed annual world bambara groundnut production estimated approximately 0.3 million ton 0.2 million ton produced africa largest producer bambara groundnut africa burkina faso niger cameroon nigeria nigeria lead gross bambara groundnut production 100,000 metric ton per annum burkina faso lead highest production yield noted existing natural breed produced low
