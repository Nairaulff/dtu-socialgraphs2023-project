nasogastric tube decompression administration intravenous fluid electrolyte replacement clinical observation moment based bologna guideline non-operative management considered without clinical improvement resolution nevertheless consensus term surgical approach open laparoscopic surgery generated controversy since surgery risk factor appearance new adhesion however clearly described surgical management chosen case peritonitis strangulation ischemia present considering short range option open laparoscopic approach surgeon must decide based patient current status experience laparoscopic approach become main surgical approach choice however surgeon argue prefer open surgery since laparoscopy reduces working space heightens risk iatrogenic lesion view utmost importance
