6.3 2.8 people clinician monitor patient weight loss program comparing progress data analysis highlight three important point first freely available model reliably predict individualized weight time function patient age sex height weight caloric intake similar previous study found nih-bwp significantly accurate predicting weight time patient although difference two model small study statistically significant could likely increase size time therefore data suggest clinician needing model forecast patient weight time use nih-bwp second notable variation observed expected body weight individual patient existed addition accurate energy intake expenditure measurement wonder variation might resolved considering patient level covariates predicting weight possible accounting genetic endocrinological pharmaceutical behavioral factor influence weight loss might improve weight change prediction finally data give clinician tool better monitor patient weight loss program prospectively collected weight data time large cohort adherent patient consuming defined daily caloric intake let describe distribution observed weight loss relative predicted weight prediction model fig comparing patient weight distribution clinician could determine responsive weight loss whether adherence might issue several factor kept mind reviewing result first although large cohort real-world patient single-center study would ideal analysis could replicated using data second primary advantage analysis precise measure caloric intake adherent individual week 1–7 however meal replacement program lasted short time observation period notably shorter validation study done table result difference observed model-expected weight seen analysis small fig course difference would increase follow-up time would increase addition calculation assumed patient consumed exclusively recommended diet provided supplement caloric intake—or rarely incomplete ingestion meal plan supplements—would introduce error predicted weight lastly nih-bwp incorporates exertion calculation experience patient sedentary defaulted patient physical exertion level nih-bwp calculation sedentary possible nih-bwp accuracy would increased study precise estimate patient exertion time summary clinician researcher confidently use commonly available weight prediction model forecast weight individual patient nih-bwp accurate however notable variation seen observed expected body weight time research required determine whether notable variability observed expected weight explained covariates
