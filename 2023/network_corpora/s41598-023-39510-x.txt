introduction conservation assessment first step preserving biodiversity however many reptile elusive understanding ecology challenging notably population status data deficiency accounted reason able make global conservation assessment reptile thus approximately reptile assessed international union conservation nature iucn status unevaluated reptile specie remains poorly understood considering 21.1 specie classified threatened among 10,196 assessed reptile specie many reptile could threatened extinction unassessed specie without sufficient ecological data much higher risk extinction assessed specie receive adequate attention conservation effort result disappearing accelerated example ignoring general ecology southern hognose snake heterodon simus resulted serious population decline local extinction many area across distribution without apparent reason identified habitat destruction degradation major reason reptile decline globally reptile sedentary lifestyle relatively low mobility understanding spatial ecology reptile identifying current distribution provide key guideline preserve although field survey effectively evaluate specie habitat distribution status temporal spatial limitation digital land cover map diverse coverage type useful effectively manage specie habitat large area using location data map commonly utilized study habitat composition change time enabling effective assessment management habitat specie furthermore spatial ecological information obtained field survey land cover map used develop ecological niche model enms reflect habitat

using enms may highly informative conservation planning slender racer orientocoluber spinalis rare yet widely distributed colubrid snake occurring across korean peninsula china russia mongolia

distribution data deficiency specie republic korea hamper proper assessment although observation frequency spinalis low decreasing rare specie designated potentially endangered protected korean
