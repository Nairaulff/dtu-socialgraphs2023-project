introduction cardiovascular disease cvd leading cause death worldwide acute myocardial infarction ami defined myocardial necrosis induced acute persistent ischemia hypoxia coronary artery although prevalence ami decreased recently owing change demographic risk factor appropriate management patient acute post-acute phase index event ami remains one important disease threatening human life health exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation considered effective intervention improving heart function enhancing physical fitness optimizing mental health research shown reduce rate cardiovascular mortality secondary event hospitalization however center-based cbcr requires daily travel hospital center rehabilitation activity accompaniment round trip costly time-consuming previous survey also found transportation problem number one problem influencing traditional participation issue transportation time expense contribute low participation rate approximately –30 researcher recommend home-based hbcr alternative cbcr research shown hbcr program feasible effective risk major adverse cardiovascular event mace hbcr seems low however urgent need improvement hbcr due lack monitoring equipment objective indicator timely transmission data doctor obtain personalized rehabilitation scheme development communication technology internet thing iot technology patient use portable monitoring device perform rehabilitation exercise home rehabilitation mode called cardiac telerehabilitation ctr extent decrease time required travel patient residence rehabilitation facility also reduces monetary cost however use transmission information technology involves severe audio video lag delay seriously affect patient experience satisfaction result although participation ctr improved still ideal coronavirus disease pandemic initiated renewed thought importance non-face-to-face intensely infectious disease epidemic present study used latest information transmission technology low latency enables synchronous transmission audio video furthermore using iot technology possible synchronously transmit vital sign data obtained rehabilitation session control center permit observation effect remotely guided duan jin exercise rehabilitation physiological psychological indicator hypothesized compared cbcr ctr using information transmission technology iot technology would better improve patient cardiopulmonary ability improve patient cardiovascular risk factor reduce level psychological anxiety depression significantly improve ctr participation rate reduce incidence mace method study
