introduction use ultra-widefield pseudocolor fundus imaging increasing retinal clinic traditional fundus camera able capture approximately 30–50° retina ultra-widefield fundus imaging able capture wider field 200° retina approximately red green laser obtain high-resolution pseudocolor image sensory retina choroid increased field view allows rapid non-invasive imaging peripheral retina affected variety retinal choroidal pathology currently relatively little known relationship peripheral change identified ultra-widefield imaging retinal disease previous study using ultra-widefield retinal imaging normal sample population noted association known retinal disease diabetic retinopathy often associated peripheral abnormality including blot hemorrhage dot hemorrhage laser mark hard exudate additionally previous study age-related macular degeneration amd patient noted increased peripheral retinal drusen like deposit study also shown posterior vitreous detachment pvd associated peripheral retinal degeneration despite study however presence peripheral retinal abnormality overall prevalence still relatively underexplored literature warrant study focusing relationship retinal disease

finding help validate grading system study also found significant association amd peripheral drusen peripheral degeneration similar finding previous study indicate peripheral drusen commonly appears amd peripheral abnormality highly prevalent patient amd significance finding implication vision completely understood finding imply amd pan-retinal disease data support claim patient amd present study observed significant presence variety peripheral retinal abnormality blot dot hemorrhage laser mark relationship amd retinal abnormality novel could warrant investigation future study addition previously reported relationship relationship identified study appear reported previously chorioretinal atrophy peripheral drusen associated unclear relationship found could suggest well inner retinal perfusion commonly associated diabetic retinopathy may outer retinal perfusion change periphery choroid study observed patient significant change thickness choroid choroidal vascular abnormality commonly noted severe examine study could investigated peripheral optical coherence tomography angiography oct-a important note however ultra-widefield pseudocolor fundus imaging important diagnostic tool condition doe diagnostic limitation retinal condition example past study shown ultra-widefield pseudocolor show moderate specificity sensitivity used identify peripheral retinal abnormality retinal tear hole limitation overcome use various diagnostic technique continued practice 360-degree scleral depressed exam routine oct-a scan multimodal approach clinical setting improve understanding retinal systemic disease previous study shown utilizing multimodal retinal imaging ultra-widefield pseudocolor fundus imaging oct-a scan improve ability understand retinal condition like diabetic retinopathy retinal non-perfusion understanding outcome shed light systemic effect diabetes mellitus patient support need continued exploration many ultra-widefield pseudocolor fundus imaging systemic condition lastly continuing gather detailed data peripheral retinal abnormality visualized ultra-widefield pseudocolor image enable develop novel method evaluate retinal problem beginning stage understanding many way deep learning artificial intelligence utilized evaluate retinal abnormality non-perfusion study add literature exploring novel way ultra-widefield pseudocolor imaging utilized generate data training artificial intelligence evaluate clinical image greater sensitivity specificity finding study limited retrospective nature data collection expected large number image excluded analysis due obscured retinal periphery confident prevalence finding association retinal disease true order reduce chance misdiagnosis prospective study full clinical grading would useful prevent association incorrect retinal diagnosis present study would also benefit replication study retinal center examine quantify retinal abnormality utilizing method study would also strengthened inclusion cohort retinal patient finding apply broader base eye patient however reassuringly present study doe validate numerous way confirming previously known association peripheral retinal finding retinal disease future study would interesting focus cohort patient diagnosis novel relationship instance studying larger cohort patient confirm peripheral drusen chorioretinal atrophy pigmentary degeneration associated understand strength association stage disease summary study describes validated peripheral grading system ultra-widefield pseudocolor retinal imaging report prevalence retinal abnormality identified using retinal ultra-widefield imaging cohort retinal clinic patient study also identifies potential association disease peripheral retinal finding would interest study information useful retinal specialist using ultra-widefield imaging gain understanding prevalence peripheral abnormality may interest researcher studying biomarkers disease overall paper add literature peripheral finding associated retinal disease aim improve method standardization use ultra-widefield pseudocolor fundus imaging clinical setting
