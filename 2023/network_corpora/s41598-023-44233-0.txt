introduction excess mortality covid-19 pandemic reported global national level world health organization defines excess mortality mortality would expected based non-crisis mortality rate population interest expected mortality based past trend represents hypothetical scenario covid-19 pandemic would occurred netherlands cumulative excess death estimated total 30,000 total number death netherlands

mortality second half remain determined however impact covid-19 pandemic healthcare public health either direct indirect may important contributing factor regarding direct impact i.e sars-cov-2 infection high incidence venous thromboembolism vte reported covid-19 patient requiring hospitalization general ward intensive care unit icu setting moreover biobank study showed risk myocardial infarction stroke heart failure atrial fibrillation vte pericarditis increased individual hospitalized covid-19 compared matched uninfected control increased risk seemed limited hospitalized covid-19 case sars-cov-2 infection also associated increased risk various cerebrovascular cardiovascular condition among asymptomatic non-hospitalized individual however others reported among non-hospitalized infected individual increased risk limited incident vte indirect impact pandemic healthcare public health might substantial could positive negative example delay cancellation routine care e.g. non-urgent procedure cancer screening delay seeking medical care change lifestyle including physical inactivity road traffic decreased incidence influenza common seasonal respiratory virus potentially changed compliance chronic medication covid-19 pandemic indirect effect pandemic patient without covid-19 also demonstrated decrease hospitalization accompanied increase in-hospital mortality broad

covid-19 pandemic could patient avoided delayed seeking care healthcare avoidance patient associated decline consultation rate primary specialist care covid-19 pandemic study performed within general population netherlands demonstrated participant indicated avoided seeking care first wave covid-19 pandemic despite experiencing symptom otherwise would contacted general practitioner medical specialist experienced potentially urgent symptom including chest pain palpitation limb weakness important determinant healthcare avoidance female sex low self-appreciated health high level anxiety depression study also reported reason healthcare avoidance including fear contracting sars-cov-2 wanting burden health care system furthermore general practitioner elderly care physician also possibly hesitant refer patient emergency department constrained healthcare resource pandemic perceived increased risk infection cardiac-related attendance emergency department england decreased first wave covid-19 pandemic reduction rate cardiovascular- cerebrovascular-related referral diagnosis treatment described england italy china consequently clinical state patient admission severe covid-19 pandemic compared pre-pandemic period finding limited cardiovascular disease single-center retrospective study reported decrease number trauma-related injury present emergency department netherlands moreover welsh study reported decline incidence rate several chronic condition mental health condition respiratory disease compared expected rate potentially missed diagnosis cardiovascular disease cause increased health complication excess mortality acute treatment provided appropriate secondary preventive care initiated therefore finding may important understanding excess mortality observed covid-19 pandemic netherlands similar netherlands excess mortality also observed england july october reduction routine diabetes care delivery following onset pandemic associated increase non-covid-19 related mortality another possible contributing factor lower incidence cardiovascular disease could competing risk dying covid-19 may prevented risk patient developing studied cardiovascular disease additional study needed determine whether delayed avoided care indeed led increased incidence complication excess mortality increased incidence vte hospital diagnosis first second wave covid-19 pandemic may attributed higher risk vte hospitalized covid-19 patient previous study demonstrated risk vte among hospitalized covid-19 patient higher hospitalized patient influenza covid-19 vaccine availability increased vte incidence study predominantly driven rise hospital diagnosis without concurrent increase dvt addition difference result primary sensitivity analysis suggest stronger positive association covid-19 wave non-primary hospital diagnosis may provide evidence increase incidence may due complication covid-19 hospitalized patient finding may support hypothesis covid-19 patient apart conventional thromboembolism pulmonary in-situ thrombosis might also occur another contributing factor increased incidence vte particular observed study may increased awareness use diagnostic imaging already early pandemic several study reported high incidence thrombotic complication hospitalized covid-19 patient especially critically ill icu patient therefore physician may inclined send covid-19 patient diagnostic imaging course pandemic threshold vte suspicion subsequent diagnostic testing patient covid-19 lowered increased use diagnostic imaging second wave compared first wave covid-19 pandemic also reported addition number diagnosed limited subsegmental artery higher second wave compared first wave absolute increase hence suggested previously part increased incidence second wave may represent overdiagnosis increased incidence vte predominantly driven covid-19 pandemic may important long-term consequence large proportion survivor develop post-pulmonary embolism syndrome month acute chronic complication negatively affect quality life however long-term complication covid-19 associated seem similar non-covid-19 associated finding consistent previous study impact covid-19 pandemic hospitalization cardiovascular disease study global impact covid-19 pandemic stroke care reported 11.5 decline stroke hospitalization pandemic compared pre-pandemic period addition hospitalization acute coronary syndrome england february may declined comparison limitation study include absence data non-hospitalized setting patient tia atrial fibrillation dvt example necessarily admitted hospital therefore severe case possibly missed especially case covid-19 pandemic constrained healthcare resource decline incidence tia atrial fibrillation hospital diagnosis may therefore overestimate actual decline incidence diagnosis first covid-19 wave however decline number first diagnosis tia atrial fibrillation stroke first covid-19 wave also reported primary care setting decline incidence cardiovascular disease may also least partially attributed underregistration diagnosis hospital admission furthermore data collected nationwide data set prone misclassification especially registration primary hospital admission diagnosis therefore difficult distinguish diagnosis present admission diagnosis developed hospitalization possible misclassification may influenced result sensitivity analysis restricted primary hospital admission diagnosis observed lower incidence vte first wave pandemic strength study include large study population included data complete dutch population assessed impact covid-19 pandemic hospitalization broad range cardiovascular disease including venous arterial thromboembolic disease study therefore contributes quantifying collateral health damage covid-19 pandemic highlight future pandemic effort made prevent healthcare avoidance conclusion population-based study describes relevant change hospitalization cardiovascular disease netherlands covid-19 pandemic compared previous year disease incidence hospitalization decreased especially first wave covid-19 pandemic however incidence hospital diagnosis increased covid-19 pandemic compared previous year additional study needed determine long-term impact covid-19 pandemic delayed avoided care covid-19 associated health condition
