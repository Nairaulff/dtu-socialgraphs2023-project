pd-mci mean 26.7 range 18.9–38.2 known risk factor dementia yet pd-mci rather heterogeneous condition encompassing several subtypes cognitive decline thought confer different risk progression dementia heterogeneity reflects diverse neuropathological process pd-mci consistently associated progressive accumulation α-synuclein amyloid-β pathologic tau specie particularly frontal temporal cingulate
