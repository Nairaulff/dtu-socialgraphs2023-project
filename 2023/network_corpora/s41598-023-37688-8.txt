introduction chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd patient often complain chronic insomnia patient reporting difficulty falling asleep staying asleep unrefreshing sleep .this prevalence double general population may attributable several factor including nocturnal dyspnea reduced physical activity time spent outside reduced exposure bright light expansion sleep opportunity mean coping disease-related fatigue nocturnal dyspnea copd-related medication deteriorate sleep depression anxiety also contributor poor sleep prevalent copd rate respectively recently relationship low activity level sleep disturbance copd demonstrated using actigraphic measurement currently known whether poor sleep induces low activity level opposite copd however shown insomniac increasing physical activity improves sleep quality pulmonary rehabilitation recommended comprehensive intervention copd based thorough patient assessment followed patient-tailored therapy include exercise training education behavioral change designed improve physical psychological condition promote long-term adherence health-enhancing behavior shown decrease anxiety depression improve quality life reduce healthcare cost
