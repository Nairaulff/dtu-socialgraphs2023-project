introduction fewer case pituitary surgery performed japan year among endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal pituitary/skull base surgery etss common number case increasing every year case surgeon make incision pituitary dura remove tumor arachnoid damage cerebrospinal fluid csf leakage empirically sufficient apply fibrin glue packing fat excised cavity however situation intraoperative csf leakage observed method alone sufficient typical reconstruction method include dural closure using various patch graft including fascia patch graft covering defect vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap former includes gasket-seal method used unless bone margin around dural defect remains anastoclip reported simple method dura mater suturing etss several limitation device expensive clipped properly without sufficient suture allowance therefore classical suture technique using needle thread often necessary difficult due need deep manipulation require practice master technique training kit practicing laparoscopy deep suturing endoscope constructed low cost purchased commercially meanwhile similar etss practice kit available market creation low cost training kit suturing etss reported drawback unrealistic pituitary surgery simulator exist purpose dural suturing training large expensive barrier skill acquisition therefore study aimed create dedicated dural suturing training kit etss close

typical practice scene shown fig figure actual training upper panel image practicing lower panel surgical field envisioned suture pituitary dura mater incised single horizontal letter suture large incision pituitary dura mater using free graft full size image figure show situation suture pituitary dura mater incised single horizontal letter practicing example useful dural suturing fenestration surgery rathke cleft cyst easy slip-knot technique used suture passed dura mater ligated outside body sent deep surgical field figure show extended transsphenoidal surgery field wide incision pituitary dura dura frequently shrunk condition suturing dura mater together usually impossible therefore free graft fascia lata placed underlay sutured time nitrile glove cut square used substitute free graft hence sensation slightly different actual fascia lata graft technique useful suturing graft dura mater discussion study low cost simple easy-to-use training kit dural suturing endoscopic transnasal pituitary surgery created total cost practice including cost stick-type camera despite minor difference nasal cavity extending similar live patient situation created almost identical real surgery parafilm used material dura mater easily removable feel penetrating needle close real dura mater however tugged strongly forceps disadvantage stretching deforming hence good material would better solution kit useful practicing dural suture since dural suture sella turcica often made completely watertight auxiliary material fat graft fibrin glue needed prevent spinal fluid leakage real surgery pituitary dura sutured endoscopic camera 30° field view placed lower end nasal cavity pituitary surgeon use endoscope instead 30° endoscope case trainee remove paper straw insert stick-type camera syringe imitated nasal cavity word training kit used 30° field view although training kit low cost simple easy-to-use angle carefully calculated like actual surgery endoarm mainly used camera 30° field view etss moreover camera 70° field view occasionally used observation toward anterior skull base shown fig training kit also simulate vision endoarm camera 70° field view therefore ability observe angle actual surgical endoscope suggests simple easy-to-use training kit used suturing exercise also developing good surgical instrument suturing word although report development surgical equipment using expensive model possibility development done without using high-class model figure observation anterior skull base training kit also simulate vision endoarm camera 70° field view illustration created biorender.com full size image needle holder dura mater suturing etss expensive used practice inexpensive forceps substituted firm grip forceps tip although low cost needle holder would sufficient training feel would different indicating preferable use one practice real surgery possible similarly better use suture training actual surgery suturing easy slip-knot method every time training suture becomes shorter shorter problem large number suture available would preferable however although difficult obtain training still achieved one needle practice divided process needle penetration process ligation using easy slip-knot method ligation process alone inexpensive thread kite string used practice training kit study created neurosurgeon already proficient pituitary surgery therefore limitation could evaluate practice effect inexperienced young surgeon measuring time required suturing training may preferred however may appropriate suture time real surgery influenced anatomical factor size patient nasal corridor important accurate suture reliable fast procedure however expected practicing kit enable inexperienced young surgeon become familiar deep suture operation despite inherent subjectivity experienced reduced stress performing suturing real surgery suturing time shortened practicing training kit data shown conclusion simple easy-to-use training kit dural suturing etss successfully made little expense hope kit widely used future many pituitary surgeon practice suturing help raise level pituitary surgery additionally expected kit used developing surgical instrument without using high-class model
