introduction snakebite envenoming medical emergency important health problem worldwide million snakebite occur year leading 100,000 death annualy despite recent attention challenge snakebite little known distribution venomous snake therefore spatial variation snakebite risk accessibility vulnerable human population healthcare system potential shift high risk area snakebite due climate change remains unknown consequence management snakebite hampered lack information around globe ensure successful snakebite management necessary identify high snakebite risk area identifying area high risk snakebite help locate target area awareness raising program effectively provide antivenoms vulnerable group knowledge current snakebite risk pattern remains limited venomous snake responding climate change shifting habitat cope global warming thus complexity snakebite management increase therefore call effort identify high snakebite risk area climate change habitat suitability model hsms

famous snake world named spider tailed viper pseudocerastes urarachnoides specie medically important four specie echis carinatus macrovipera lebetina naja oxiana persicus widespread iran therefore responsible snakebite incident country although previous study investigated challenge snakebite iran reporting snakebite incident still little known medically important venomous snake distribution potential change distribution climate change previous study shown climate change change distribution pattern biodiversity including snake iran suitable habitat specie expand climate change others lose
