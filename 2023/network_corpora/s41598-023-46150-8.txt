commonly known vitamin vitamin recognized several hormonal function thought occur interaction vitamin receptor vdrs receptor widely expressed various cell type play key role mediating effect vitamin target tissue one function interaction vitamin vdrs present pancreatic beta islet cell study animal model shown mouse lacking functional vitamin receptor vdrs exhibit impaired insulin secretion moreover study shown vitamin supplementation stimulate insulin biosynthesis pancreatic islet rat human certain variant vdr gene linked impaired insulin secretion increased risk developing type diabetes mellitus t2dm furthermore study suggest vitamin may play role enhancing peripheral insulin sensitivity possibly interaction vdrs expressed human skeletal muscle adipose tissue cell specifically skeletal muscle adipose tissue cell play crucial role determining peripheral insulin sensitivity responsible glucose uptake response insulin secretion vitamin enhances promotes insulin secretion pancreatic β-cells insulin one underlying molecular mechanism involves regulation intracellular concentration non-genomic action 25-hydroxyvitamin 1,25 2d3 identified responsible increasing cytoplasmic level leading activation insulin exocytosis pancreatic β-cells subsequent increased insulin secretion vitamin deficiency contribute insulin resistance several potential mechanism example activation peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta ppar-δ 1,25 2d3 enhances insulin sensitivity additionally vitamin improves glucose metabolism upregulating sirtuin sirt1 insulin receptor substrate1 irs1 glucose transporter type glut-4 signaling cascade enhancing glucose uptake especially evident high glucose-treated c2c12 mouse myoblast cell c2c12 myotubes vitamin also modulates low-grade chronic inflammation often associated insulin resistance notably pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf-α interfere peripheral insulin sensitivity inhibiting insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation irs-1 disrupts appropriate activation downstream insulin signaling molecule including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pi3k translocation glut-4 cell surface vitamin counteracts release pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α interleukin il-6 c-reactive protein furthermore bioactive form vitamin strongly suppresses activation nuclear factor kappa-b nf-κb mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk signaling pathway effectively preventing transcription pro-inflammatory gene consequently vitamin significantly alleviates inflammation within adipose tissue
