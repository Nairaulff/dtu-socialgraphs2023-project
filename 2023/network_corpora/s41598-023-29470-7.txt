introduction angiosarcoma rare aggressive vascular sarcoma complex completely unraveled biology comprise primary novo secondary arise due dna damaging factor like radiotherapy ultraviolet exposure case limited local disease treatment consists resection often combined radiotherapy progressed locally advanced metastatic disease patient treated palliative systemic chemotherapy mainly paclitaxel doxorubicin approved targeted drug used advanced metastatic disease tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib despite therapeutic effort prognosis patient still poor recently reported median overall survival month confidence interval 10–16 month five-year survival rate novel therapeutic approach therefore desperately needed patient progress hindered diversity rarity lack model perform preclinical
