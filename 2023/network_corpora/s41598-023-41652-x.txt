introduction low back pain lbp common musculoskeletal problem affecting nearly population throughout life occur age adolescent elderly cause individual social problem individual suffers lbp high recurrence rate occurs throughout lifetime approximately yearly left untreated might turn chronic stage complex mechanism difficult treated addition intervention doe address underlying mechanism could responsible high recurrence rate therefore intervention designed focus specific underlying mechanism movement control impairment mci proposed mechanism underlying chronic low back pain clbp mci defined poor control coordination lumbar pelvic segment movement one recent study demonstrated greater positive movement control battery test patient clbp suggesting clbp could caused mci several study also indicate aberrant movement pattern clinical movement test used identify mci patient clbp lumbar multifidus muscle responsible static dynamic stability lumbar spine alteration cause inability control lumbar spine resulting mci electromyography study reveal decreased bilateral activity functional task one study investigated activation using ultrasound imaging patient clbp suspected underlying mci researcher found lower activation patient clbp remission compared individual without lbp although reduced activation resulted several factor including muscle atrophy fatty infiltration slow-to-fast muscle transition recent study demonstrated activation deficit may caused reduced neural drive primary motor cortex change cortical excitability motor evoked potential cortical topography etc patient clbp supported several study change also associated altered movement pattern based existing evidence could speculated insufficient activation causing mci result change cortical excitability reduced neural drive accordingly restoration cortical excitability increase neural drive thereby increasing activation anodal transcranial direct current stimulation a-tdcs non-invasive neuromodulation technique used enhance cortical excitability application a-tdcs area showed favorable result cortical excitability pain a-tdcs induces glutamatergic synapsis turn enhances calcium ion influx via n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda receptor calcium ion influx ability induce long term potentiation ltp necessary neural plasticity addition gamma-aminobutyric acid gaba activity cause neuron likely fire action potential applying a-tdcs glutamatergic synapsis would activated causing reduced gaba activity thereby increasing cortical excitability enhanced cortical excitability using

discussion study designed investigate immediate effect a-tdcs cortical excitability activation explore relationship cortical excitability activation participant clbp remission first compared whether participant clbp actually change cortical excitability activation p2p finding support participant clbp decreased mep amplitude although found trend participant clbp shorter csp lower activation finding yield statistical significance several study reported change cortical excitability patient clbp researcher suggest change caused reflex inhibition response pain/injury reflex inhibition reflected muscle activation movement pattern alteration may aim minimize load injured structure addition repetition adapted muscle activation movement time result neuroplastic change represented altered cortical excitability within motor cortex non-significant increase mep amplitude a-tdcs intervention support hypothesis expected tdcs modulate cortical excitability finding inconsistent study reporting immediate effect a-tdcs cortical excitability however study applied a-tdcs healthy individual could cause different response compared patient clbp another potential explanation reversed effect a-tdcs theoretically a-tdcs induce increased mep amplitude depolarization resting membrane potential causing long-term potentiation ltp -like plasticity effect however a-tdcs might induce long-term depression ltd -like plasticity resulting inhibiting excitability another mechanism a-tdcs induce increase cortical excitability opening influx however overwhelming occurs voltage channel counter regulation mechanism take place process turn block n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda receptor could eventually result decreased cortical excitability although between-participant variability different

participant characteristic time day investigation control neurophysiological condition might affected response a-tdcs significant difference mep amplitude healthy individual participant clbp indicated participant clbp actually experienced change cortical excitability would suggest one session a-tdcs min might sufficient increase cortical excitability therefore study needed determine appropriate dos explore possible outcome considering controlling possible neurophysiological mechanism using true experimental study design significant change csp post-intervention also support hypothesis could due cortical inhibition caused gaba activity a-tdcs activate nmda receptor induce calcium-dependent plasticity however excessive might trigger gaba activity counter regulate blocking nmda receptor resulting unchanged csp another explanation might participant experience csp change compared nolbp counterpart addition several study found high variability csp suggested csp might unreliable measurement investigate neurophysiological response participant clbp finding show increase activation a-tdcs intervention expected study investigated effect a-tdcs activation therefore unable compare contrast study however study commonly used a-tdcs reduce pain presence pain cause reflex inhibition leading inability perform maximum contraction one proposed effect a-tdcs reduce pain could prevent reflex inhibition thereby indirectly increasing activation study recruited participant clbp remission non-significant difference activation group suggests activation deficit participant clbp therefore mechanism might taken place study correlation p2p activation participant clbp partially support hypothesis decreased mep amplitude would result activation deficit study demonstrated change cortical excitability others found activation deficit patient clbp researcher assumed relationship existed cortical excitability activation moderate pre-intervention strong post-intervention positive correlation support existence relationship correlation suggest cortical excitability may play critical role activation therefore intervention include neuromodulator enhance cortical excitability one study reported relationship change cortical excitability activation patient clbp discrepancy study could study included participant clbp underlying mci homogeneous group study might included clbp different underlying mechanism although study show improved cortical excitability activation a-tdcs intervention found moderate strong positive correlation mep amplitude activation finding least
