discussion main objective research evaluate varroa treatment strategy term efficacy impact honey bee colony health strategy involved exposing colony cold storage fall short period longer day followed miticide application rationale cold storage would induce colony stop brood production remaining sealed brood emerged varroa colony either open frame cell attached adult bee thus susceptible miticide strategy combine honey bee colony management method already common use many commercial beekeeper combined treatment strategy case effective reducing varroa infestation change varroa infestation level

colony better nutrition even stress level higher summer rainfall may september tucson area whereas difference rainfall resulted marked difference forage availability term quantity duration increased rainfall resulting forage level resulted much larger colony support conclusion better nutritional status among adult bee year large difference change adult population level cold storage period likely due colony activity activity cold storage largely limited bee movement around cluster colony outside would warm daily temperature would lost many bee foraging effort support large population although even high rainfall year little available time room guarded optimism concerning exploration approach limited cold storage would likely small negligible impact colony- individual measure health strategy
