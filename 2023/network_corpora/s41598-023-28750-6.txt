live low- middle-income country thailand among middle-income country thailand witnessing aging society since proportion elderly people account 10.3 country population expected proportion elderly population continue increase population projection thailand show thailand become fully aged society enter super-aged society world health organization proposed concept active aging focus promoting quality life elderly term ability value benefit potential definition active aging appropriate process lead good health social participation security enhance quality life elderly study researcher used term active aging context broadened perspective health view health everyone responsibility healthcare worker given everyone potential take care individual health concept support process stepping aging society every country several country including thailand developed tool ass active aging older adult past decade development tool based active aging index accordance framework focus three area health participation security increase indicator according context area previous study abroad mostly presented national benchmarking index example european center vienna developed active aging index ass active aging older adult among european country thailand developed active aging index using big data collected national statistical office survey limitation indicator may covered oral health

0.91 whereas stability life 0.44 financial stability 0.50 scored lowest classification score age group showed elderly tended decline score particularly evident health condition except stability life elderly rural thailand increased age finding unique rural community thailand evidence support difference urban rural community country highlight need consider variation active aging different region thailand area different cultural characteristic conclusion summary health potential first condition independent self-reliant living key characteristic older adult elderly continued participation activity give sense self-esteem also perception dignity psychological dependency family factor help improve mental health elderly affect physical health addition various factor security life also help elderly experience physical security safe living economic security give confidence lead quality life result study indicate elderly people rural area lower northern thailand moderate active aging index although problem financial stability government support term pension health insurance implication s-aai tool used quantitative measure older adult rural community self-assess active aging potentially used questionnaire interview research practice local administrator related official apply indicator main component s-aai rural elderly guideline planning improve quality life elderly finally tool developed make widely available new tool used monitor active ageing outcome country level investigate potential older people regarding actively participate health social activity promote active role older people strength limitation present study limitation first although sample large nationally representative area thailand may different indicator active aging therefore study needed externally validate assessment tool developed various cultural context second study focus rural thai culture generalized country may different cultural context regarding certain s-aai indicator housing social activity health service etc third due different environment urban rural area diversity economic structure social participation demographic local community accordingly developed measuring tool may older people urban area therefore study limited development measurement instrument rural community fourth research assistant collect data may affect data especially interview older person read write however researcher already controlled quality data training research assistant prior fieldwork data collection regarding overview objective research research technique achieved research skill data collection lastly study examined psychometric property s-aai used reliability next study including confirmation factor analysis strength study indicator active aging individual level used comprehensively many dimension foundation development novelty indicator important elderly yet compiled thailand namely oral health nutritional status included study finally development scale active aging assessment quantitative structure allows participant self-assess
