2015–16 2019–21 full size table discussion using nationally representative sample study aimed identify factor affecting discrimination towards plhiv high hiv prevalence state india examine change time despite government ban discriminatory attitude towards plhiv change discriminatory attitude changed marginally half-decade men woman shortage hiv/aids awareness program recent year might led non-so-significant change discriminatory attitude moreover india concentrated effort sub-groups population identified high-risk group left engagement every individual thus accounting low insignificant change might substantial impact emotional well-being healthcare-seeking behavior disclosure hiv status among infected hiv thus fueling spread hiv result clearly showed discriminatory attitude towards plhiv significantly associated individual-level characteristic age educational status marital status mass medium exposure wealth quintile religion caste residence comprehensive knowledge consistent previous study observed nfhs-4 younger men woman likely discriminatory attitude however recent round survey younger men woman likely discriminatory attitude previous study reported higher stigma among younger individual view young individual erroneous belief mode transmission prevention practice leading stigma discrimination towards plhiv past study highlighted importance hiv-related information prevention control service reducing discriminatory attitude india similar finding study conducted tajikistan found woman reproductive age experienced considerable decline capacity correctly identify transmission belief prevention strategy period 2000–05 finding education significant predictor reducing discriminatory attitude i.e risk discriminatory attitude decreased higher educational attainment line previous study illiteracy might result misconception correct mode transmission consequently resulting discriminatory attitude towards plhiv result indicate despite increase comprehensive knowledge hiv/aids two survey round discriminatory attitude among men remained constant although numerous study reported exposure mass medium reduces risk discriminatory attitude towards plhiv result obtained line result recent round survey contrast one probable reason behind higher discriminatory attitude among younger individual higher discriminatory attitude despite increased mass medium recent round might reduced government focus awareness regarding hiv/aids massive counseling test treatment policy past might helped individual gain hiv-related information reduced negative attitude hiv-infected people result individual higher economic status lower likelihood discrimination consistent study conducted china kenya predicted probability discriminatory attitude reduced poorest richest wealth quintiles consistent previous literature found rural place residence associated increased likelihood discriminatory attitude access mass medium various health promotion message particularly urban area might contribute rural–urban divide discriminatory attitude additionally comprehensive knowledge reduced risk discriminatory attitude men woman respectively 0.51 0.46–0.56 nfhs-4 0.84 0.76–0.91 nfhs-5 result fairlie decomposition indicated mass medium exposure comprehensive knowledge significantly largest contribution discriminatory attitude sex term comprehensive knowledge correct information may crucial promoting acceptance plhiv reducing discriminatory attitude towards plhiv study highlighted role mass medium campaign increasing hiv knowledge decreasing gap related stigmatization discriminatory behavior surprisingly knowledge regarding mother-to-child transmission associated increased risk discriminatory attitude risk high woman using condom last sex significantly associated increased risk discriminatory practice woman study contrast study reporting negative association condom use perceived stigmatization result obtained fairlie decomposition also indicated correct knowledge mother-to-child transmission using condom last sex contributed mostly difference men woman meghalaya 2.68 time 2.56 time respectively likely discriminatory attitude respective counterpart nagaland although meghalaya lower hiv prevalence nagaland india hiv estimation lower level comprehensive knowledge way hiv transmission might contributed higher discriminatory attitude nagaland well established type epidemic experienced particular setting influence individual attitude far coverage concerned important make effort improve coverage high-priority state overall predicted probability revealed probability discriminatory attitude towards plhiv increased marginally accepting attitude often affected individual-level community-level experience largest increment probability discriminatory attitude observed among men comprehensive knowledge poorest wealth index mass medium exposure may attributed striking improvement medium exposure irrespective educational attainment previous cohort cross-sectional study found actual perceived prejudice lead emotion worthlessness self-blame variety source including healthcare professional community member intimate relationship eventually undermine adherence art regimen moreover intersectional stigma directly linked decreased art adherence racial discrimination associated detectable viral load thus discrimination affect individual mental health also hinders access healthcare service resulting plhiv remaining underground conclusion recommendation despite recent aid education campaign increased public awareness hiv/aids marginal increase discriminatory attitude towards plhiv high hiv prevalence state india matter concern therefore empirical evidence magnitude discriminatory attitude practice towards plhiv country along key driver high hiv prevalence state may work vital input designing suitable intervention enhance accepting attitude plhiv may help enhance service uptake plhiv change health-related quality life finding advocate strengthening expanding hiv testing treatment service conjointly imparting accurate information hiv transmission mode finding portray need reinforce existing programme policy promote information campaign policy aimed reducing discrimination plhiv also critical increase access hiv counseling testing service well develop educational initiative addressing misconception mode transmission combat discrimination programme efficiency effectiveness ensured linking community-level programme activity organized self help group shgs resulted paradigm shift empowering woman india since discrimination plhiv negative impact mental health access healthcare service important address discrimination part overall hiv prevention control strategy limitation one major limitation study face self-reported information discriminatory attitude might include error bias moreover question used assessing discriminatory attitude towards hiv/aids hypothetical thus people reported might clear thus direct relationship attitude behavior could established cross-sectional nature prevents establishing cause-and-effect relationship result interpretation association
