introduction cardiovascular disease cvd significant global health challenge affect individual family community society whole world health organization report cvd leading cause death worldwide staggering 17.9 million death recorded despite advancement medical research technology cvd continues leading cause mortality many low- middle-income country often attributed insufficient implementation existing preventive treatment strategy notably country former union soviet socialist republic ussr severely affected burden cvd ischemic heart disease ihd ranking leading cause death non-communicable disease ncd stroke rank second highlight urgent need effective sustainable measure prevent control cvd furthermore crucial acknowledge impact cvd extends beyond mortality significantly affect quality life individual disease thus prioritizing prevention control cvd imperative mitigate adverse effect individual family community society whole necessitates comprehensive strategy encompass prevention early detection diagnosis treatment management cvd achieving goal requires collaboration among various stakeholder including government healthcare provider researcher individual reduce burden cvd promote better health outcome prevention cvd categorized three level primary secondary tertiary prevention primary prevention involves lifestyle modification adopting healthy diet engaging physical activity quitting smoking secondary prevention crucial reducing burden cvd involves identifying individual already disease providing appropriate medical care prevent
