introduction anaplastic thyroid carcinoma atc rare aggressive malignancy account total thyroid carcinoma contributes mortality median life expectancy patient atc month disease-specific mortality rate reach despite dire figure favorable prognostic factor associated atc specifically prior study revealed younger age smaller tumor size non-invasion microinvasion smaller component atc associated longer survival however whether asymptomatic atc differs symptomatic atc term clinical characteristic overall prognosis sufficiently investigated asymptomatic atc rare form atc distinctive characteristic rapidly exacerbating symptom unlike well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma usually present asymptomatic thyroid nodule atc patient present history fast-growing neck mass dyspnea dysphagia voice change within month hence asymptomatic atc could potentially considered different disease entity term prognosis similar study performed papillary thyroid carcinoma ptc treatment outcome survival rate compared asymptomatic symptomatic ptcs study found asymptomatic ptc associated lower recurrence-free survival higher overall survival rate symptomatic ptc finding highlight importance elucidating whether individual asymptomatic atc might expect better disease course therefore study aimed retrospectively examine clinicopathological characteristic cohort patient atc compare patient asymptomatic

discussion well known early detection malignant tumor various organ lead better prognosis best knowledge study literature discussing whether early detection asymptomatic status associated survival patient aggressive tumor atc result revealed survival rate asymptomatic atc patient without metastasis better symptomatic atc owing popularization screening program easier access various imaging modality diagnostic technique chance detecting small early stage atc increased also interpreted increasing detection atc incidentaloma considering asymptomatic atc smaller tumor size consequently increasing chance detecting asymptomatic atc relatively longer survival seems necessary different approach asymptomatic atc classical atc treated result also showed asymptomatic atc patient younger smaller tumor longer survival period symptomatic atc patient atc arise novo malignant transformation pre-existing well-differentiated tumor appears likely asymptomatic atc likely arise novo considering smaller size patient generally younger age according result asymptomatic atc requires active surgical treatment patient need concerned condition patient symptomatic atc however study
