symptomatic woman although study shown support treatment asymptomatic review recommend screening treatment condition therefore advocate treatment symptomatic woman numerous epidemiological microbiological data shown sexually transmitted infection unclear whether asymptomatic milder symptomatic whether pathogenesis response antibiotic treatment complication rate differ paucity data controversy exists whether asymptomatic woman treated thus despite high prevalence national guideline currently recommend screening treatment asymptomatic woman possibly due lack rigorous clinical
