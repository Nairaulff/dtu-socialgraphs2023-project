introduction coronavirus disease covid-19 caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 significant concern regarding global impact healthcare setting viral replication phase enormous immunological inflammatory challenge since innate adaptive immunity may disorderly activated sars-cov-2 infection magnitude inflammatory response may result local systemic organ damage furthermore immunological imbalance may associated worse outcome greater vulnerability causing example secondary infection bacterial fungal infection propolis natural resin produced bee various part plant several property antioxidant anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory activity besides property experimental clinical trial show propolis capable targeting virus green propolis-derived compound may generate negative feedback expression transmembrane serine protease tmprss2 engages activation spike protein virus also interferes angiotensin-converting enzyme ace2 anchoring therefore limiting entry virus cell also evidence propolis compound capable reducing activation p21-activated kinase-1 pak1 overexpressed lung important target used virus shield adaptive immunological response locally stimulate exaggerated inflammatory response recent open-label randomized clinical trial adult hospitalized due covid-19 demonstrated safety efficacy brazilian green propolis epp-af decrease length

hospital cost arising covid-19 infection great concern around world ability reduce hospital stay one day addition significant reduction rate secondary infection significant economic impact economic analysis subject present study result certainly positive effect public health point view first randomized study use epp-af moderate severe covid-19 non-vaccinated patient showed significant decrease length hospital stay however trial conducted first wave disease hospital stay longer patient vaccinated also patient using orotracheal intubation randomization excluded previous study present study almost one quarter patient vaccinated furthermore first third covid-19 wave progress made regarding drug therapy scientist gained knowledge disease also virulence sars-cov-2 substantially changed new scenario justifies difference length hospital stay study suggesting benefit propolis adjunct therapy greater case poorer prognosis first study albeit statistical significance difference length hospital stay present study may show trend combined finding first trial sars-cov-2 infection associated secondary infection compared non-infected patient coronavirus infection cause unprecedented immunological imbalance make body system vulnerable additionally combination viral infection use immunosuppression-inducing drug increase risk secondary infection bacterial fungi one according recently published systematic review critically ill covid-19 patient may secondary infection contributes higher mortality another recent observational study demonstrated secondary pulmonary infection common issue followed bloodstream infection uncertain origin infection related central venous catheter one interesting finding study reduction secondary infection bacteria fungi threefold decrease compared placebo group defined positive culture specimen blood urine tracheal aspirate know occurrence secondary infection among covid-19 patient frequent may negatively impact evolution patient well substantially increase hospitalization cost mortality rate propolis promotes immunomodulation associated immunodepression also antimicrobial activity virus fungi bacteria despite inherent characteristic possible ensure finding relationship mechanism study needed confirm finding beecovid2 demonstrated use standardized brazilian green propolis extract dose used safe even among critically ill patient without single case hospitalization readmission hospital due epp-af side effect safety analysis performed throughout entire study period previous randomized study used epp-af already shown

limitation due lack supply pandemic glomerular filtration assessed using creatinine level calculated dry chemistry method suffers interference dipyrone metamizole drug widely administered fever pain control limitation study included study conducted single center phone monitoring patient discharged hospital end epp-af treatment period day data concerning potential benefit long covid syndrome

performance safety test drug among critically ill patient covid-19 new phase pandemic new drug involved experimental data show potential action propolis viral target tmprss2 ace2 receptor pak1 justifies experimental use epp-af result new perspective treat disease lead immuno-inflammatory dysregulation therefore conclude coronavirus infection negative impact people worldwide immunological challenge open window opportunity use propolis natural immunomodulator important propolis may considered tested treat disease cause immunological dysregulations present study provides clinical evidence explored researcher study epp-af dose tested safe use adult patient mild moderate covid-19 use medication significantly associated decrease length hospital stay study needed
