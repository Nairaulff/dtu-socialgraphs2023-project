shortcoming absence analysis racial difference study possible explanation observed allele variation demonstrated ias1 genotype distribution varies race however would like point brazilian highly genetically admixed population determination race evaluation skin color inaccurate context interest note allele frequently detected african population absent european origin identified high percentage individual study thus self-reported racial identification study population would likely inaccurate pursued conclusion result implicate genetics variable influence outcome following sars-cov-2 infection prior investigation implicated additional gene polymorphism potential modulators consequence sars-cov-2 infection would like stress redundancy regulatory mechanism almost always limit consequence single genetic variation therefore need still exists identify additional gene interaction involved regulation cytokine response sars-cov-2 infection comprehensive analysis obtained genetic factor associated development severe covid would beneficial include genetic screening initial analysis sars-cov-2-infected individual
