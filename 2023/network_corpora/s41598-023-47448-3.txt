addition understanding problem obesity underlying cause mena prevention strategy generally line high-income country however country mena region face several different obstacle compared high-income country include severely limited number health professional inconsistency training approach obesity prevention lack formal sponsored guideline poor public transport system insufficient funding obesity research framework developed guide obesity prevention strategy mena region encompassing individual societal level change change include limiting energy intake total fat increasing consumption fruit vegetable legume whole grain nut restricting sugar intake promoting regular physical activity public health prevention national regional level also considered including use mandatory food labeling marketing restriction taxation certain food beverage responsible marketing practice especially targeting child prevention excess body weight requires multi-factorial strategy individual behavior change also required strength limitation study several strength including use advanced analysis study burden disease linked ebw well focus mena region 30-year period however also several limitation one limitation pertains absence high-quality data several low- middle-income country mena region circumstance may introduce potential either underestimating over-estimating burden associated ebw moreover gbd study employed different modeling system estimate burden country data available meaning finding based estimation rather real data secondly certain disease attributable ebw reproductive disorder e.g infertility dental disorder e.g periodontitis psychiatric disorder e.g depression reported present study thirdly study definition overweight obesity solely relied bmi practical imprecise
