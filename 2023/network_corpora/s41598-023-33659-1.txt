globally growing public interest laboratory test used evaluation immune status individual respect sars-cov-2 infection global demand various kit igra-format test nab assay introduced market evaluation humoral t-cell-mediated response although many study conducted confirm usefulness test result still insufficient evidence test result clinically useful therefore aimed determine change test result covid-19 booster vaccination respect type covid-19 vaccination confirm whether test result used predict risk sars-cov-2 infection long-term follow-up period overall enrolled total hcw participant

52.8 28/53 whereas nab remained high 53/53 similar trend observed kaplan–meier analysis linear decreasing trend positive rate qfn-sars respect number day last vaccination nab assay month last vaccination result indicate antibody response caused sars-cov-2 vaccination last relatively long although response t-cells disappears quickly recently murugesan investigated long-term accuracy sars-cov-2 igra assay anti-sars-cov-2 igg antibody assay 0.5 month post infection 87.5 participant tested positive igra-sars igg assay however positive rate assay decreased 79.5 71.8 month covid-19 infection respectively assay decline positive rate seemed slower result study finding would indicate duration actual infection-induced immunity longer vaccine-mediated immunity 1st test result qfn-sars ichroma nab attempted analyze relationship vitro test result sars-cov-2 infection significant difference sars-cov-2 infection positive negative group ichroma nab assay however paradoxical result observed—the proportion covid-19-confirmed case among qfn-sars-positive participant higher among qfn-sars-negative participant study period epidemic caused omicron variant broke republic korea although could consider various factor related sars-cov-2 infection result study showed vitro igra nab test sars-cov-2 could used indicator predict risk covid-19 infection especially omicron variant considering test result according type vaccination booster group showed significant difference positive rate qfn-sars ichroma nab assumed distribution number day last vaccination relatively wide booster group could affected positive rate qfn-sars ichroma nab booster group positive rate qfn-sars ichroma nab differ according type vaccination result would indicate t-cell-mediated immunity humoral immunity measured vitro test would affected type vaccination elapsed time since last vaccination proportion covid-19-confirmed participant influenced type vaccination booster booster group indicates type vaccination associated protection omicron variant infection therefore would recommend factor close contact infected patient high viral load exposure comorbidity host immune status considered assessing risk covid-19 infection rather type vaccination vitro test result despite significant result study several limitation study first although death due sars-cov-2 infection retrospectively collected history covid-19 infection questionnaire symptom therefore correlation test result symptomatic characteristic covid-19 could analyzed addition may hidden infection diagnosed due asymptomatic infection second study participant limited hcws enrolled relatively young healthy person age thus result study would representative entire population addition two-thirds participant voluntarily dropped second test possibly resulting selection bias therefore large-scale study conducted overcome present limitation provide informative result regarding igra-sars nab assay study provides comprehensive qfn-sars ichroma nab test result reflect t-cell mediated humoral immunity sars-cov-2 respect number day last vaccination type vaccination positive rate qfn-sars ichroma nab rapidly increased booster vaccination positivity nab assay remained high month last vaccination however positivity qfn-sars showed rapid decline half participant negative month last vaccination finding also suggest vitro test result type vaccination may useful predict risk covid-19 infection result study indicate although vitro test measuring immunity sars-cov-2 may reflect sars-cov-2 vaccination well clinical usefulness still unclear large-scale study performed address point material method study participant total hcws working chung-ang university hospital enrolled study enrolled
