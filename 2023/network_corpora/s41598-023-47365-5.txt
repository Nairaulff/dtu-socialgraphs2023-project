introduction life expectancy birth integrates mortality pattern across age group therefore defined many year newborn expect live average current mortality rate different developmental stage change epidemiology study commonly considered statistical measure overall population health limited available data published world bank data show worldwide 72.75 year year improvement 52.58 year rapid increase attributable epidemiological transition remarkably improved human health example morbidity rate decrease across human life span.﻿ nurse physician two major practitioner group healthcare workforce contributed significantly reducing mortality morbidity rate improve overall population health leading extension nursing female dominated profession historically nurse considered handmaiden subordinate male-dominated medical profession doctrine established principle required nurse work supervision direction medical staff commonly accepted modern nursing started mid-1900 outcome nightingale environmental theory published time modern nursing continued strive autonomy recognition discipline equally important medicine provide complimentary element healthcare recognition however

recognition physician receive healthcare service delivery comparing physician nurse contribution overall population health measured nursing healthcare contributes significantly physician healthcare significant disparity remains although ruled competing effect common confounding factor associated economic affluence urbanization obesity physician healthcare service may contribute independent nursing healthcare service however nursing healthcare appears play minor role maintaining improving physician contribution controlled suggests nursing industry influence overall population healthcare dependent physician workforce physician role may statistically explain nurse responsibility contributing physician healthcare nursing healthcare economic affluence urbanization obesity incorporated analysing relationship contrast however nursing healthcare show negligible explanation physician healthcare maintaining improving suggests nursing role contribution population health hidden within measure used identify physician contribution overall population healthcare fundamentally statistical role nursing healthcare promoting overall population health dependent physician contribution may suggest nursing industry lack autonomy defined nurse ability apply professional knowledge experience healthcare make independent clinical decision regarding patient care autonomy nurse rightfully expect equity decision-making process reciprocal exchange physician developing implementing patient healthcare plan refined set metric used measure discrete nursing impact determining non-medical related aspect patient care nurse opportunity establish autonomous principle care although nursing striving autonomy since study result highlight nursing industry still recognised independent contributor overall population health study examining variation physician- nurse game continue describe medical team largely direct nursing workforce delivery physician measure healthcare service illustrated statistical relationship variable lack autonomy nursing industry evidenced phenomenon commonly appear healthcare system noting medicine education physician typically longer health profession nurse educational level status usually affords authority healthcare context education disparity physician nurse led imbalanced power nurse physician encourages physician take role authoritative nurse worldwide physician tend hold privileged position control remuneration often legal determinant decision patient healthcare overt dominance may reflected statistically significant difference role function physician nurse identified promoting overall population health study clinical setting role function nurse promoting overall population health may viewed documented equally important physician healthcare providing facility public inference supported several study concluded last decade although nurse physician collaborating different way overall physician remain dominant healthcare service nursing healthcare significant moderate correlation relationship became weak insignificant physician incorporated partial correlation multiple linear correlation analysis may suggest nursing industry lack autonomy drive nurse make nursing clinical healthcare decision based physician diagnosis treatment plan contribution nurse nurse-physician collaboration model may allow role nursing significantly noticeable nurse follow physician healthcare decision instead exercising autonomy nursing specific healthcare plan nursing come long way since nightingale nurse nowadays may different expectation collaboration medical colleague however medical profession still consider nurse subservient may lead nurse-physician conflict turn lead job dissatisfaction therefore contribute reducing nursing workforce addition potential nurse-physician conflict nursing work physically mentally demanding nurse frontline delivering increasing complex care patient family fast paced health care service pressure nurse added nurse-physician conflict increase risk burnout job dissatisfaction eventually exit nursing career professional impact premature exit due physician-nurse conflict job dissatisfaction nursing industry may benefit deep level experience compared physician may contribute significant disparity healthcare provided physician nurse also reduce opportunity collect influence measure healthcare effect life expectancy risk experienced workforce vicious cycle nurse confidence skill knowledge fail assert contribution patient care issue also diminishes opportunity development advanced nursing practice nurse practitioner role study showed nurse physician might similar positive patient outcome primary healthcare service setting however significantly different study design compared role responsibility nurse physician promoting overall population health across primary secondary tertiary healthcare setting implication nursing practice health policy study finding may stimulate health authority nursing industry consider identifying metric track impact health authority make nursing autonomy explicit supported recognised also provide continuous support nursing industry improving autonomy re-defining notion autonomy developing educational content especially clearly defining expanding scope nursing practice without continuous improvement nursing autonomy risk nurse-physician conflict remains may contribute nurse burnout job dissatisfaction nurse leaving profession place demand healthcare system loss experienced nurse contributes instability also important nurse play complementary role physician contribution need visible considering patient healthcare plan patient satisfaction resolved implementing clear metric nursing intervention limitation strength firstly ecological study result dependent nature ecological fallacy population level correlational relationship revealed data analysis might hold true individual level however considering number distribution people involved study may achievable individual based study secondly relationship revealed data analysis-based study causal correlational thirdly data included study may fairly crude may random error population level data collected aggregated united nation agency however data collected integrated objective manner different data collect individual study also noted total number nurse physician represents healthcare employment valuable contribution allied healthcare professional acknowledged lack specific discipline data prevents inclusion data analysis considering health authority prioritize employment nurse physician due limited finance budget impact healthcare professional data analysis result could alleviated controlling gdp ppp data analysis model finally high validity variable involved study physician nurse gdp ppp urbanization obesity explain majority overall population health square incremented 70.6 table source data concerning health care variable physical exercise blood pressure cholesterol difficult extract population based study however data available might able demonstrate compare thoroughly role nurse physician determining life expectancy conclusion study suggests presently contribution nursing workforce overall population health significantly visible physician phenomenon reflects inequity power due visible measure nursing influence different level education perceived value care job historical hierarchy continue impact workplace structure nursing autonomy need explicit supported recognised without correction health service continue transmit invisibility nursing healthcare one generation nurse another
