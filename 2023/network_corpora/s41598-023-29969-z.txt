still challenging due difficulty conducting direct observation numerous scattered large time frame making classical survey method little use resulting major lack data particularly evident mediterranean sea widely recognized important hotspot marine biodiversity yet whose critical habitat endangered specie still need identified conservation purpose one elusive marine mammal
