introduction protecting health population essential policy task nation european union worldwide due high sensitivity impact environment special attention must paid protecting health school child one key public health problem currently exposure high concentration particulate matter ambient air urban rural population low-cost system monitoring concentration airborne particulate matter made government institution also developed university currently almost every major city e.g. posse least one air quality monitoring station provided government state local government unfortunately highly accurate system expensive purchased available fund need small community use low-cost measurement network make possible monitor air quality smaller town village thereby reducing technological exclusion mainly rural part population e.g. rural population comprised 40.1 poland total population negative effect particulate matter human health widely documented particular focus harmful effect fine
