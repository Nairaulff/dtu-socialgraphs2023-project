introduction biological fluid blood semen body tissue found crime scene source dna sample however case corps noticeable biological stain could found crime scene source found site like insect commonly consume human biological fluid considered case using dna typing human dna retrieved insect used identify individual insect feeding therefore source could serve invaluable evidence criminal investigation well helpful identifying missing corps removed crime scene providing useful information particularly whether insect feeding multiple food source obligate hematophagous insect commonly feed human blood bed bug potential used forensic study unlike blood-feeding insect mosquito female feed blood life stage bed bug including stage nymph adult fed blood grow survive reproduce also tend aggregate harborage blood-feeding moreover bed bug relatively long lifespan survive longer without blood meal compared mosquito flea louse thus greater chance finding recently fed bed bug site addition bed bug wingless insect likely remain close feeding location possibility bed bug appearing particular crime scene could high recent resurgence infestation bed bug nowadays short tandem repeat
