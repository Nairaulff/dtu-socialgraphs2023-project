introduction global burden report indicated typhoid caused salmonella typhi paratyphoid fever caused salmonella paratyphi 11th–14th top leading cause morbidity mortality worldwide since patient aged 0–9 year shown vulnerable aged 10–24 year developing country contributed nearly 12.5 milion global case could due higher hiv infection lack salmonella typhi vaccination lack sanitation exposure unhygienic polluted environment inaccessibility safe drinking water developing nation age patient history enteric fever infection rural residency use well spring water drinking consumption raw milk level education consumption raw meat identified predictor typhoid fever ethiopian investigating symptomatic case sanitary condition environment live accessibility safe drinking water source hygienic practice imperative devising contextual solution majority population symptomatic case drawn population-based epidemiologic data typhoid fever ethiopia however health facility-based cross-sectional
