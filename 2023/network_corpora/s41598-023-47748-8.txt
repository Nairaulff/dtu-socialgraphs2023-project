introduction discovery symbiosis started lichens—complex symbiotic assemblage symbiotic partner tightly integrated single body thallus often three dimensional separated tissue-like layer classic definition lichen involved two rarely three partner one fungus mycobiont plus one microscopic green alga photobiont and/or one cyanobacterium collectively constitute lichen definition however proven simplistic since many lichen contain microbial organism addition main partner typically bacteria yeast study algae lichen also shown surprising diversity instead one algal strain assumed lichen contain two coexisting within thallus reviewed muggia often co-occurring algae closely related specie trebouxia another typical photobiont genus example see although direct evidence still lacking algae believed reside within algal layer together occupy niche symbiotic relationship word algal cell previously assumed belong one uniform photobiont turned two different albeit closely related photobionts however instance algal diversity within lichen compared lichen photobionts much known algae present lichen coming diverse group present miniscule amount additional green algae recently termed phycobiome mostly detected two way first culturing lichen thallus e.g. sometimes happens accident researcher attempt culture lichen photobionts second metabarcoding survey reported non-photobiont algae represent small fraction produced data e.g. algae sometimes assumed grow epiphytically lichen e.g. supported study comparing algal sequence washed unwashed lichen thallus however
