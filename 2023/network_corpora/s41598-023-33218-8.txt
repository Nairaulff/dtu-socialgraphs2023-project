introduction chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd major cause chronic morbidity mortality worldwide characterized severe irreversible airflow limitation reduced functional capacity recent study show copd highest proportion mortality among respiratory disease account third leading cause death europe fourth united state prevalence copd reported 5.57 systematic review meta-analysis iran severity copd influenced various internal external factor furthermore copd associated extrapulmonary effect marker systemic inflammation extrapulmonary manifestation co-morbidities either secondary inflammatory burden copd occurring association copd due sharing risk factor cigarette smoking main contributor copd dyspnea rest appears copd worsens daily activity becomes difficult opium beneficial treating dyspnea according evidence multiple study however effect opium lung volume examined anemia well-known manifestation chronic illness could present among patient copd multiple various factor may contribute occurrence anemia copd including iron vitamin deficiency anemia chronic disease related inflammation hypogonadism comorbidities treatment related several study reported prevalence anemia ranging 7.5 copd population varying severity clinical impact anemia significant associated increased dyspnea reduced exercise capacity higher cost care increased morbidity copd patient nevertheless often symptom anemia apparent copd patient although exact origin anemia copd patient uncertain seems correlation several pro-inflammatory indicator indicating least portion anemia—i.e. anemia chronic inflammation—is caused inflammation spite association anemia copd role erythropoietin epo content still unclear epo promotes production red blood cell applies hematopoietic property stimulating proliferation early erythroid precursor differentiation later precursor erythroid lineage major stimulus epo production increase diminished arterial oxygen content associated anemia

hypoxia traditionally expected copd patient study frequently report normal lower level epo comparison healthy counterpart despite many study controversy continues regarding issue possible pathophysiology perusal addition measuring serum level epo copd patient assessing relation factor level tried review previous study get comprehensive view issue various aspect well possible reason cumulative evidence study indicates epo level increase copd patient even severe stage also significant correlation mentioned level disease severity contrary result many researcher reported higher-than-normal level epo copd patient also explained result respect hypoxia caused chronic airway obstruction along anemia chronic disease regard sharma conducted study copd patient reported significant rise epo level increasing severity disease hand study provided evidence favor lower production epo attributed dull endogenous epo response hypoxia cytokine inflammatory factor commonly increase copd patient word normal increase level epo presence hypoxia achieved copd condition also measured epo level severe critically ill respiratory non-respiratory related patient concluded epo response hypoxia decrease presence inflammation sala gazzar assessed almost copd patient total reported lower level serum epo acute inflammatory phase copd exacerbation continuation discussion study evaluated epo serum level different stage copd unanimously came conclusion although average level epo level lower copd patient differed various stage disease highest level measured stage disease mentioned serum level low first last stage lower level epo first stage came back near-normal saturation level lack enough hypoxia stimulate epo production last stage may related excess inflammatory factor prevent expected epo production presence considerable hypoxia point production origin epo view kidney mostly study reported chronic renal failure copd patient even normal kidney-related functional serum marker e.g. blood urea nitrogen creatinine following impairment epo production incalzi pointed kidney-related adverse effect drug commonly used copd management e.g. hydrosoluble drug antibiotic used copd exacerbation drug frequently used treat comorbid condition e.ge digoxin atrial fibrillation thiazide hypertension taken consideration several common simultaneous disorder diabetes mellitus hypertension due adverse reaction related drug also pathophysiology impact impair function kidney main production source epo however focused study regard justified notwithstanding foregoing epo level expected logically lower copd patient particularly exacerbation period end stage disease without doubt prospective cohort study large sample copd patient various stage ass associated factor blunted epo response hypoxia decision management furthermore molecular tissue study related epo production help significantly find exact pathophysiology mentioned contradictory response epo hypoxia copd patient based result current study statically significant association found epo serum level level copd patient regard markoulaki found substantial positive correlation however study limited evaluating patient iron profile-related data exclude anemia low level followed iron deficiency almost similar bias found study conducted attaran reported significant correction level epo level anemic copd patient study measure level vitamin b12 folate exclude combined anemia result attributed total anemic patient low level copd condition contrary several study reported significant inverse correlation level epo level word higher epo level lower level explained normal bone marrow response epo rising well iron transportation impaired copd patient therefore elevated serum epo result increasing level occurred due chronic disease overall seems epo compensate completely anemia low level copd patient study several limitation sample size small mild moderate copd n't find sample n't evaluate epo level according different stage disease another limitation n't consider past drug history patient corticosteroid antibiotic drug potential renal toxicity effect influence inflammatory response furthermore n't evaluate recent oxygen therapy management affect epo level study also conducted among hospitalized patient patient lower severity copd require hospitalization included study considering factor along control group including non-copd patient necessary increase understanding epo among copd patient conclusion epo level traditional expectation n't increase copd patient epo production also n't compensate anemia chronic disease considers common comorbid disorder patient
