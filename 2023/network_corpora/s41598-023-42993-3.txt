lifetime medication side effect pert forgetfulness financial burden accessibility issue table table theme unit meaning full size table theme lack knowledge patient reported unaware disease condition treatment option nature drug taking believed need take medication need adhere long period time n't know take medicine time doctor n't tell stopped taking eating medicine prescribed doctor every time. n15 taken medicine doctor said medicine needed taken rest life worried long-term use would cause damage liver kidney stopped taking later. n24 theme self-adjustment pert patient exert subjective initiative taking medication changed dosage according severity symptom type diet usually take medicine felt fine felt stomach rising little uncomfortable would take pill own. ate porridge morning would take medicine went restaurant ate greasy went socialize drank would add pill myself. n22 theme lifetime medication since patient show obvious symptom stable phase benefit taking medication clearly perceived short term coupled fact pancreatic enzyme need taken patient long period time long-term use medication may reduce patient doctor told take drug life dosage could little young increased older took n't seem much effect stopped taking wanted wait get older. theme side effect pert patient reported side effect taking medication severe case affected daily life chose take medication originally symptom diarrhea bowel movement 3–4 time day however took medicine would become constipated may bowel movement several day stomach felt bloated stopped taking it. n10 theme forgetfulness patient said would forget bring medicine forget take drug busy work needed addition small number patient said relied reminder others improve working salesman nature work different others sitting office medicine desk sometimes forgot take medicine sometimes would forget take medicine busy irregular meals. n14 medicine taken mealtime easily forget take without reminded sometimes remembered meal. n23 theme financial burden patient reported taking medicine would cause certain financial burden chose take medicine switch drug take four pill time three time day pill bottle medicine finished within day wife part-time worker n't afford eat much switched domestic pancreatic enzyme tablet later. theme accessibility issue considering rare disease hospital provide medication patient need patient reported lacked access medication drug bought county two hospital provincial capital sale also buy lot buy week drug time medical insurance reimbursement addition inconvenient travel due covid-19 epidemic troublesome buy medicine. n20 discussion although pert recommended first choice treatment pei caused significant center related variance management pert clinical practice many patient treated standardized way available study data adherence pert among patient limited may important identifying level factor influencing may help better implement pert management improve prognosis pei knowledge study first explore adherence pert among patient china mixed study design also strength paper allowing comprehensive perspective factor influencing overall pert currently poor chinese patient qualitative interview found factor affecting included lack knowledge self-adjustment pert lifetime medication side effect pert forgetfulness financial burden accessibility issue study rate non-adherence pert reached 48.0 12.8 good result close adherence pert year follow-up study khandelwal believed result true consistent current status long-term adherence pert patient however figure significantly lower study barkin crosby study rate adherence pert respectively reached patient pancreatic cancer undergoing total pancreatectomy islet autotransplantation one possible explanation high study patient included study chose receive interventional treatment pancreatic duct stone serious condition pancreatic cancer painful traumatic surgical treatment experience patient study may contribute higher medication consciousness adherence pert adherence pert patient study also lower common chronic disease meta-analysis khunti involving 300,000 patient type diabetes mean rate poor 37.8 another meta-analysis durand patient refractory hypertension reported pooled rate non-adherence 31.2 cancer cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic respiratory disease listed world health organization top four non-infectious disease worldwide compared common chronic disease widely publicized well-known individual given rarity clear lack knowledge among patient evidenced interview study patient reported well informed condition medication taking n15 n24 therefore believed lack disease knowledge may one potential reason poor adherence pert among patient addition inadequate inconsistent medication guidance health care provider may another reason poor existing study concluded lack uniform consensus among gastroenterologist diagnosis treatment pei small number pancreatic specialist surveil treat pei adequately compared primary care provider therefore recommend first standardized guideline additional education necessary healthcare provider national advanced pancreatic disease institution develop promote pei treatment guideline applicable patient country conduct educational course guideline interpretation non-pancreatologist pei pert help prescribe uniform standardized plan pert second positive patient informed disease medication taking example providing patient information prescribed medication shown improve patient addition given usually decrease time given long-term nature pert lack short-term effect follow-up monitoring management medication behavior also integral improving example electronic pill box electronic reminder smartphone application closer communication doctor patient thought help improve patient study result multivariate analysis showed lower level education income contributing factor non-adherence pert addition forgetfulness side effect cost medication potential factor affecting patient finding fall within framework consistent previous research finding economic factor considered one important influence patient quantitative analysis patient poor likely lower monthly household income cny excessive medical cost financial burden may cause poor therefore patient may financial difficulty health care provider offer alternative cheaper drug choice time prescribing term medication guidance doctor nurse personalize medication strategy according patient lifestyle guide adjust dosage reasonably according diet reduce medication expenditure medical administration medical institution improving non-local medical insurance settlement service reducing patient expense effective mean improve patient addition interview also found even patient stable job similarly reported difficulty n14 type work work environment working hour patient may influence willingness behavior taking medication however factor explored depth previous article level education another important factor influencing patient adherence pert easy understand patient received better education usually better comprehension acceptance knowledge related disease medication richer knowledge reserve resulting better meanwhile existing view suggested patient cognition disease etiology disease harm outcome controllability directly influence however also found interesting phenomenon generally younger patient usually higher level education compared older patient adherence pert better however fact found appeared worse younger patient possible explanation first younger patient relatively new diagnosis shorter course disease relapse disease experience frequent second young patient tended better level education one hand good education made easier understand accept disease knowledge hand patient also relatively rebellious likely exert subjective initiative process taking drug comply drug prescription considering youthfulness good acceptance medication non-adherent patient rapid development new medium technology instant music video platform based existing e-reminders smartphone application social platform video pushing medication instruction instant music video platform tiktok bilibili may new way improve patient study also limitation first small sample study based single center although changhai hospital largest diagnosis treatment center china even asia patient center representative east china small sample may also lead bias result study addition patient visited center tended severely ill better adherence primary medical institution therefore finding study may fully representative pert patient institution second used c-mmas-8 measure patient use scale data medication possession ratio proportion day covered validation may lead bias result real situation third although study provided first-hand information adherence pert chinese patient limited number factor influencing patient included analysis may led result study novel expected future study based research cooperate center different scale china carry extensive large-sample research adopt multiple measurement method incorporate indicator patient disease knowledge health literacy self-efficacy indicator patient exocrine pancreatic function explore various subjective objective disease-related factor adherence pert chinese patient validate result study providing reference management pert conclusion study revealed status adherence pert among patient east china mixed study design overall east chinese patient poor low education income level contributing factor poor qualitative analysis result showed seven theme associated non-adherence included lack knowledge self-adjustment pert lifetime medication side effect pert forgetfulness financial burden accessibility issue healthcare provider personalize medication strategy improve patient
