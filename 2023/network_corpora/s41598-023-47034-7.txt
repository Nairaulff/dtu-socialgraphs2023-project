qol fatigue among patient diagnosed long covid infected covid-19 develop symptom compatible diagnosis long covid result shown positive highly significant correlation group diagnosed long covid develop symptom compatible regarding functional status physical activity level qol fatigue observed participant diagnosed long covid demonstrated severe functional limitation much higher percentage group develop symptom compatible new condition likewise level physical activity low experienced worsening compared previous state regarding qol result revealed greater deterioration patient diagnosed long covid compared group develop symptom following infection maintenance observed among people diagnosed long covid persistent symptom cause various disruption including dyspnea fatigue functional impairment cognitive repercussion understandable complication significant clinical practical relevance health well-being fact also raise important question functional presentation consequence long covid especially woman majority group also seen sample since tend greater age-related disability men similarly despite requiring hospitalization people covid-19 infection may also risk deterioration physical cognitive mental health furthermore study support result finding debilitating symptom profile patient reflects far-reaching consequence health well-being prolonged period morbidity decreased engagement daily activity sedentary behavior consequent qol decline observed long covid also found impact energy reserve suffer one study found association duration covid infection level physical activity independence however observed individual longer duration disease unable regain previous level physical activity study also demonstrated low level physical activity due sedentary behavior according result study reported half patient developed long covid worse qol patient reported pain discomfort health problem mobility impairment problem related daily activity self-care study also reported long covid result poor qol possibly caused post-traumatic stress syndrome however likely consequence covid-19 alone combination reduce qol contrast narayan poudel concluded acute covid-19 infection greater impact qol long covid hand taking account severity fatigue result shown significant worsening patient long covid meeting criterion 92.4 case another study also found half sample significant burden fatigue median follow-up week especially concerning given recommended returning work viral infection occur week avoid deconditioning post-covid fatigue according literature found individual one year initial infection meet diagnostic criterion time fatigue moreover extremely common case long covid severity persistence disrupt life although currently unclear treat chronic fatigue people long covid pulmonary rehabilitation may key treatment individual second objective study aimed determine whether functionality level physical activity severity fatigue related patient qol result also show highly significant correlation analyzed variable patient qol implies patient sample severe functional limitation lower level physical activity greater fatigue severity experienced marked decrease qol however despite significant relationship patient functional status proven predictor qol observed far one main characteristic long covid disability generated symptom alter functionality extent incapacitates patient performance everyday task spain found patient diagnosed long covid limitation disabled performance adls disability significant impact qol various exploratory analysis consistent result regarding relationship fatigue reduction function increase disability reduction qol highlight need recover qol shown exercise provides significant improvement pain tolerance movement optimization physical function recovery autonomy adls addition psychological improvement resulting exercise could provide patient coping strategy help overcome health challenge directly influencing qol sense physical inactivity sedentary behaviour independent risk factor multiple harmful health effect reduction qol therefore establishing rehabilitation program prevent secondary consequence physical inactivity priority range symptom associated long covid well severity frequency duration posing significant challenge publication precise recommendation physical activity individual one study found week physical rehabilitation physical function exercise capacity could improved functional status remained expected value patient age another study found week pulmonary rehabilitation exercise capacity patient long covid significantly improved limitation found study research needed establish causality consequence long covid impact daily life cross-sectional study study conducted single spanish autonomous community could considered limitation extrapolating result general population therefore would necessary expand sample broaden geographic area including different urban rural area need research area study conducted topic also worth noting type survey used introduce information bias self-administered survey conclusion result shown highly significant correlation group developed long covid experienced symptom regarding functional status level physical activity qol fatigue found severe functional limitation impairment low level physical activity considerable worsening qol fatigue patient diagnosed long covid.likewise functionality level physical activity severity fatigue also directly related qol therefore worse functional status level physical activity fatigue worse qol although one variable found predictor qol person functional status current finding highlight urgent need creation specific strategy addressing long covid support pathway patient enable recovery pre-covid-19 qol according result also need address profound physical qol impact recommendation adapted clinical state individual multidisciplinary approach different healthcare professional physical cognitive rehabilitation highlighted case address deficit caused consequence covid-19 infection importance continuing conduct study outline correct path towards recovery long covid patient emphasized outlining extent chronic effect long covid affect health well-being qol population growing burden rehabilitation highlight need develop effective intervention multidisciplinary support pathway
