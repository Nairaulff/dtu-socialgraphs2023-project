treated promptly child may develop coronary aneurysm form thromboses stenosis japan 17,000 child affected annually nearly 400,000 japanese child suffered potentially lethal illness increasing number case reported country region developed 1980s–1990s intravenous immunoglobulin ivig mainstay treatment however even ivig treatment 20–40 patient relapse require additional immunomodulatory therapy multiple scoring system developed predict ivig resistance score developed sano kobayashi egami frequently used japan although sensitive used non-japanese population patient predicted high risk ivig
