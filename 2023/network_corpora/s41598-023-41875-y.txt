typically occur patient gut dysbiosis lead severe clinical complication pseudomembranous colitis toxic megacolon infection difficile cause disease induces inflammation producing two large exotoxins—tcda tcdb—which damage intestinal lining glucosylation rho-family gtpases host epithelial cell according recent cdc report cdis responsible approximately 223,900 hospitalized patient case 12,800 death moreover cdis contributed approximately billion u.s. healthcare cost standard-of-care antibiotic treating cdi fidaxomicin vancomycin neither drug available metronidazole recommended
