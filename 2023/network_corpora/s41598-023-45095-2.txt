introduction cardiovascular disease cvds major cause morbidity mortality worldwide cvds accounted 17.9 million death representing death across globe despite availability established prevention treatment approach cvds remained leading cause disease burden decade besides pharmacotherapy lifestyle change additional modality gaining popularity treatment approach mindfulness-based intervention cold water immersion breathing exercise discussed possible approach reduce cardiovascular risk may used complementary therapy cardiovascular prevention mindfulness-based intervention aim reduce blood pressure employing stress-reduction technique including meditation designed foster state inner awareness calmness recent meta-analysis shi colleague reveals decrease systolic mmhg diastolic mmhg

therapy chamber temperature ranging discrepancy may attributed difference study design form exposure cryotherapy whole-body cold-water immersion cold shower exposure duration body area exposed cold temperature session frequency additionally participant characteristic may also influence result seems especially risk patient benefit cold water immersion reported study michalsen jacob healthy individual included present study worth noting form cold exposure included physical activity like swimming water treading therefore possible covariance physical activity study ruled cardiovascular reactivity previous research demonstrated cold water immersion stimulates positive adaptive change human body resulting increased readiness handle stress factor change may attributed reduction sympathetic nervous system reactivity well increased antioxidative protection according jacob repeated vasomotor stimulation repeated cold-water exposure lead down-regulation adrenergic receptor thus reduced sensitivity resistance vessel catecholamine based hypothesized regular cold exposure whm could reduce cardiovascular reactivity cold pressor test reduction perceived pain cold pressor test consists pain cold component activates sympathetic nervous system leading significant α-adrenergic vasoconstriction increased total peripheral resistance subsequent elevation postulated regular cold exposure could mitigate vasoconstrictive effect acute cold exposure thereby reducing cardiovascular response cold pressor test would relevance magnitude individual hemodynamic response stressor marker cardiovascular risk previous research shown repeated exposure cold environment decrease sympathetic response acute cold exposure evidenced reduced change hrv plasma norepinephrine however present study significant change pwv perceived pain could reported whm mentioned earlier study mäkinen employed significantly longer cold exposure duration could triggered robust acute reaction ultimately leading pronounced adaptive process long term result line louis found hrv index change alter session whole-body cryotherapy furthermore leppäluoto found cold-induced stimulation plasma norepinephrine

however literature effect meditation cardiovascular risk factor healthy individual consistent cochrane review unable draw conclusion effectiveness meditation due considerable variation study present study whm includes meditation component could induce change hrv pwv worth noting intervention period present study relatively short compared study many duration exceeding month however study nidich also failed show change month meditation intervention cohort individual similar age normal breathing slow deep breathing commonly practiced meditation yoga several relaxation technique shown

study huttunen winter swimmer claimed energetic active brisk control author also found winter swimming increased mood decreased fatigue tension may linked enhanced secretion catecholamine however study utilized questionnaire profile mood state compared study another study lubkowska winter swimmer believe cold stimulation improves ability cope daily stress meditation also demonstrated promising result reducing psychological distress across different population setting effective enhancing vitality however according recent meta-analysis positive effect meditation intervention evident at-risk
