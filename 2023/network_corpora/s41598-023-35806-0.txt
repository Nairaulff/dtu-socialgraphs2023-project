already received booster dose prior commencement study exclusionary factor limited elderly cohort constituting study participant subset participant especially comorbidities might exhibit immunosenescence thereby adding complexity observation study ass ba.2 ba.3 ba.4 delta-variants evaluated one booster dose whereas country second third booster also introduced particularly older adult immunocompromised individual india one booster dose recommended study designed ass efficacy booster however mentioned higher level immune marker known correlate reduced risk symptomatic infection though efficacy sii-nvx-cov2373 reported higher chadox1 ncov-19 bbv152 present study designed superiority trial necessary regulatory approval heterologous booster dose study ass homologous booster dose sii-nvx-cov2373 sii-nvx-cov2373 used primary immunization india however nvx-cov2373 already evaluated homologous booster dose showed prototype strain variant evaluated immune response following booster similar higher associated high level efficacy phase study vaccine study reported heterologous booster induced greater systemic reactogenicity homologous counterpart however study heterologous booster induced numerically higher systemic reaction homologous booster chadox1 ncov-19 prime cohort homologous booster induced numerically higher local reaction heterologous booster bbv152 prime cohort though study powered detect difference conclusion heterologous booster sii-nvx-cov2373 chadox1 ncov-19 bbv152-primed adult demonstrated non-inferior booster response numerically higher achieved homologous booster chadox1 ncov-19 bbv152 vaccine also exhibited acceptable safety profile
