metastasis treated pipac-ox patient colorectal cancer treated primary tumor surgery four week postoperative patient treated pipac-ox experienced significantly abdominal pain patient treated counterintuitive finding since visceral resection performed pipac-ox whereas visceral resection regularly performed one major proclaimed benefit pipac-ox limited effect treatment quality life would favorable palliative setting however current study suggests patient undergoing pipac-ox experience significantly abdominal pain patient undergoing patient undergoing pipac-ox advanced cancer stage patient therefore pipac-ox patient risk oncological pain especially since resection performed patient group however previously published crc-pipac study showed increase abdominal pain one week procedure followed relative decrease abdominal pain three week later suggesting increase abdominal pain least part due pipac-ox given repetitive intent treatment pipac-ox palliative patient repetitively exposed abdominal pain considered treating physician patient starting treatment stress need adequate analgesic protocol study investigating pipac palliative setting also suggested treatment pipac-ox well-tolerated initially thought may result chemical peritonitis even peritoneal sclerosis leading abdominal pain effect pipac abdominal pain may drug dependent two study reported greater inflammatory response greater morphine demand pipac-ox pipac cisplatin/doxorubicin furthermore although dose-dependent effect pipac-ox abdominal pain reported two dose-escalating study palliative setting third study investigating pipac-ox adjuvant setting i.e high-risk colorectal cancer patient observed severe abdominal pain majority patient treated pipac-ox required either dose-reduction intraperitoneal oxaliplatin discontinuation adjuvant pipac-ox however different setting third study adjuvant instead palliative may explain observed dose-dependent effect abdominal pain since patient palliative setting might willing accept severe adverse event last-resort treatment seven study also presented pro pipac various drug various primary tumor among pipac-ox cpm three provide pro result abdominal pain four one reported transitory increase pain whereas three reported pain remained stable treatment pipac however study provide separate pro result pipac-ox patient cpm pipac-ox monotherapy impedes interpretation finding addition recent study reported increased pain level repetitive pipac treatment measured patient reported outcome study report increased pain level provide context increased pain level result present study show severity abdominal pain pipac higher conventional surgery thereby providing important insight pain burden caused pipac-ox although first study compare abdominal pain patient cpm treated pipac-ox patient colorectal cancer underwent limitation study first procore study population resembles population-based study since patient colorectal cancer allowed participate contrast pipac-ox study population consists highly selected group palliative patient required adequate clinical condition participate clinical trial might affected baseline quality life second timing two pro measurement matched two study i.e baseline four week surgery timing pro measurement matched could provided insight short-term e.g one week surgery longer-term e.g several month surgery difference pro two group given poor prognosis patient pipac-ox group long-term pro measurement available group limitation may hinder generalizability result extent provide important information patient reported pain pipac-ox treatment even concern short-term non-repetitive treatment situation third limitation concern operation-technique due registration procore study information could obtained regarding operation technique e.g open vs. laparoscopic expected open technique would result post-operative pain surgical trauma larger might increased reported abdominal pain score group might attenuated differential effect found study comparative study laparoscopic pipac might thus result even bigger difference abdominal pain netherlands approximately patient crc underwent open surgery underwent laparoscopic surgery however present finding simultaneously signifies difference abdominal pain greater pipac despite group frequently undergoing open surgery conclusion patient colorectal peritoneal metastasis treated pipac-ox reported significantly abdominal pain four week postoperative patient colorectal cancer underwent although effect might part caused advanced tumor stage nevertheless indicates physician underestimate longevity severity abdominal pain pipac-ox physician counsel patient accordingly consider analgesic measure reduce symptom especially since pipac-ox mainly applied palliative setting often repeated several time future study focus development analgesic protocol aiming reduce abdominal pain treatment pipac-ox
