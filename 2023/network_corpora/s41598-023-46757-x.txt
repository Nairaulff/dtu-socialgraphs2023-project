introduction diabetic retinopathy primary cause preventable vision loss among working-aged adult developing country however patient diabetes reach advanced stage usually remain asymptomatic therefore avoid visual loss regular screening early detection vision-threatening patient diabetes necessary ensure timely treatment present early treatment diabetic retinopathy study etdrs fundus photography protocol remains gold standard determining severity requires pharmacological mydriasis acquire seven individual field stereoscopic manner thereby generating retinal image etdrs seven-field imaging cover approximately 75° retina represents approximately entire retinal area however requires additional time obtain trained personnel imaging grading good cooperation patient photographer etdrs severity scale also regarded gold standard grading severity clinical trial however photographic grading system level required clinical care specific definition level detailed require comparison standard photograph thus difficult remember apply clinical practice previous study fundus imaging covering 45°–60° retina substantial almost perfect agreement standard etdrs seven-field imaging

five-field image three different threshold reason could clarus image formed combining red green blue image thereby generating realistic color image additionally red scanning laser ophthalmoscopy penetrates deep choroid clarus image easily affected cataract furthermore clarus image 7-µm resolution allowed detection microaneurysms small retinal hemorrhage therefore clarus fundus imaging method detect subtle lesion factor mentioned may also explain fair agreement covered clarus covered optos image comparison five-field optos image revealed discrepancy one severity level eye 8.6 optos image

showed moderate agreement discrepancy one severity level observed clarus image greater proportion eye higher severity level clarus optos image five-field image especially clarus image data suggest uwf fundus imaging technology detect peripheral lesion lead increased severity level previous study shown eye peripheral lesion threefold increased risk progression step almost fivefold increased risk progression proliferative although role additional lesion risk determination clinical significance identified lacked large number patient pdr data suggest peripheral lesion uwf image might useful identifying severe providing clearer clinical assessment severity showed fair agreement optos clarus 133°/200° image although optos image captured greater retinal area clarus 133° image retinal area clarus 200° image discrepancy one severity level mostly observed clarus image addition reason mentioned clarus imaging system partially confocal optic feature may limit presence eyelash eyelid artifact retinal image thus clarus imaging system captured larger visible retinal area notable strength study first prospective study evaluate early severity using conventional five-field optos clarus image large cohort patient diabetes however limitation first study performed single institution rather multiple institution second study used five-field image standard comparison rather gold standard etdrs method third might bias related grader camera could masked besides study evaluated early severity using international clinical diabetic retinopathy severity scale widely used ass severity clinical practice rather etdrs severity scale designed primarily clinical trial thus result applicable assessment clinical practice rather clinical trial limitation addressed future study conclusion compared five-field optos clarus fundus imaging method high resolution high-quality wide field fundus exhibited excellent performance assessing early severity thus clarus fundus imaging method superior early detection
