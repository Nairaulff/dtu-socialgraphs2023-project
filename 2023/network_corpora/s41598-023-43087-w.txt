introduction fungus non autotrophic organism grows type soil forest field mountain hill desert deadwood log similar decomposted organic residue concept diet fundamental human health led increased consumer demand nutritional supplement functional food mushroom-based nutritional supplement functional food become attractive recently although mushroom currently constitute large part human diet consumption continues increase due high nutritional value apart mineral fiber fatty acid essential amino acid present contain broad range vital compound nutritional medical property phenolic compound polyketides terpene steroid beta-carotene vitamin mushroom distinguished range vital activity anti-microbial activity antiviral activity several study consider mushroom easy source obtaining phenol vitamin natural antioxidant perhaps synergy component main reason beneficial effect described clinical trial several specie edible wild mushroom high level protein vitamin mineral magnesium calcium sodium iron zinc selenium etc. low calorie value also contains dietary fiber especially chitin beta glycan responsible functional property recent scientific study confirm bioactive compound many specie edible mushroom involved lowering blood cholesterol level protect various disorder including tumor property directly indirectly associated high antioxidant activity traditionally mushroom agaricus spp genus used treat many common condition including atherosclerosis hepatitis increased blood grease diabetes dermatitis cancer also contains immune antibacterial antitumor property
