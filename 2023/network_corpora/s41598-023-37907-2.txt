introduction past year omicron variant circulating dominating infection landscape within covid-19 pandemic omicron variant subvariants ba.1 ba.2 ba.5 recently bq.1.1 ba.2.75.1 xbb/xbb.1 characterized enormous escape potential due destruction/deletion variety epitope recognized neutralizing antibody therapeutic monoclonal antibody hardly effective especially recent omicron variant moreover number breakthrough infection vaccinated individual significantly increased since emergence omicron variant due numerous mutation omicron spike protein mediates entry cell binding human ace2 receptor many antibody elicited vaccination and/or infection fail bind mutated spike thereby exert neutralizing potential condition efficient neutralization omicron variant remaining neutralizing antibody requires high affinity titer booster vaccination given several reason antibody titer rise rapidly within first week booster vaccination providing best protection virus drop back baseline level within first month baseline antibody level built immunologic memory immunological memory also triggered booster vaccination increase memory long-lived plasma cell furthermore booster vaccination stimulates broader immune response formed somatic hypermutation antibody affinity maturation case mrna vaccination paul naaber study described decrease neutralizing titer booster vaccination occurs slowly compared titer
