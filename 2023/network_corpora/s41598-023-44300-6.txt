anorexia nervosa investigate person risk e.g. restraint eater normal thus anorexic bmi similarly investigated bmi low although diagnosis may never made apart disease onset risk bmi usually within normal range tends low none burkinabe male adolescent showed syndrome meeting pope diagnostic criterion increased bmi participant underweight found risk factor cardinal symptom dfm current study sample circumstance lower bmi higher poverty rate high-income country mean resource-limited setting like burkina faso risk factor increase different phenomenological way specific characteristic study

child meaning life child raised follow traditional patriarchal role ideal man ideal woman men masculinity authority figure woman femininity mother respectful helper husband often father spend time

literature associated severe psychiatric comorbidity finding emphasize prevalent risk factor low-income study sample psychological suffering depicted expected 1.2 respondent possibly depressed quality life normally distributed nevertheless finding unattainable muscular body ideal possibly associated dfm indicate burkinabè male adolescent internalized negative body image e.g. sufficiently big enough prevent future psychological suffering psycho-educational intervention body image likley need developed limitation finding need considered first due cross-sectional study design unable determine
