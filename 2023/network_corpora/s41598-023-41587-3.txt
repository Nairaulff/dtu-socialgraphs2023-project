introduction comprehending speech people around chatting challenging task school-age child face daily primary school student spend almost school day listening speech presence unwanted task-irrelevant sound despite recommended maximum unoccupied level noise background noise primary class high child engaged individual work peaking 70–77 group work different type sound stimulus concur creating classroom background noise come outside school building e.g. traffic noise outside classroom e.g. student voice corridor generated directly within classroom e.g. heating ventilation sound child voice effect type noise directly compared classroom noise generated child found detrimental speech perception listening comprehension performance verbal math task reason traced back mechanism auditory distraction depending closely spectro-temporal characteristic informational content background noise consisting one two several competing speaker may evoke domain-specific interference competing semantic process required complete verbal task attentional capture shifting listener attention task hand mixture mechanism student level education report sound inside classroom i.e. speaking classmate occur often sound coming outside primary school child particular report type noise interferes ability hear teacher perceive unpleasant notably primary school child due limited attentional span semi-structured teaching method talkative exuberant older student thus generating highest level chatter noise worth recalling effect noise younger child particularly significant compared older student adult given still-developing cognitive skill linguistic resource disambiguation speech noise therefore loop child first grade instruction language learning development social skill central concern population potentially benefitting reduction internal classroom noise level also one generating highest level high attentional-capture noise especially detrimental verbal learning task although research primary school classroom traditionally devoted speech perception extra load basic auditory function imposed background noise jeopardizes also higher level spoken language processing increasing consensus ensuring optimal speech perception classroom necessary condition listening comprehension alone enough indeed comprehending spoken message encompasses simply identifying single word comprehension process converting spoken language meaning within mind listening comprehension includes recall reasoning making inference heard message crucial ability student achieve academic success study focusing effect multi-talker noise listening comprehension suggest signal-to-noise ratio snrs i.e difference level speech level background noise child significantly able follow oral instruction comprehend sentence answer question short narrative passage presence noise compared quiet consequence learning challenging acoustic environment limited drop task accuracy also include increased listening effort indeed whereas ideal condition speech understanding effortless largely automatic challenging listening situation e.g. high background noise non-native listener need explicit engagement listener cognitive resource understand speech thus yielding increased effort listening effort defined deliberate allocation mental resource overcome obstacle goal pursuit carrying task involves listening relationship cognitive demand task effort straightforward modulated listener motivation listening task motivation governs well perceptual cognitive ability used understand said motivation interacts cognitive demand stronger listener motivation willing she/he put effort task even task demand high e.g. high background noise recent meta-analysis indicates motivational factor small-to-medium effect listening effort effect size might vary depending specific combination motivational factor e.g. financial reward individual trait listening effort measure worth noticing vast

difference conceptual model reinten indicates effect sound human performance moderated personal factor e.g. noise sensitivity emotional state theoretical model effort fuel elu suggest part inter-individual variability could accounted difference individual cognitive ability knowledge language notably still unclear whether effect individual characteristic constant i.e. independent listening condition thus subtending listener performance whatever sound environment moderated sound environment e.g. stronger effect individual factor specific listening condition concerning linguistic skill individual language ability lexical grammatical semantic knowledge receptive vocabulary found support child performance speech perception spatial listening noisy condition effect
