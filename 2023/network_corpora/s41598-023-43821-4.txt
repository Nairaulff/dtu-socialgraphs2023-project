introduction brucellosis zoonotic disease many name century malta fever mediterranean fever causative agent discovered british microbiologist david bruce later named brucella disease called brucellosis primary host pathogen animal preference various brucella spp specific animal specie however close contact infected animal lead infection non-primary host specie like human especially endemic region like mediterranean basin risk contracting brucellosis quite high contact animal abortion material handling carcass consumption contaminated raw animal product unpasteurized milk well laboratory work main source infection thus veterinarian hunter cook laboratory worker occupational group increased risk brucella infection identification disease brucellosis often difficult due unspecific symptom e.g usually fever sweat headache arthralgia weight loss may occur episodically month even year infection therapeutically diagnosis followed long antibiotic treatment relapse frequent especially endemic rural area medical care often sufficiently ensured global number human infection per year hardly estimated reliably brucellosis often underreported literature 500,000 case per year cited number however pointed number reliable product incorrect citation throughout brucellosis literature based statistical modelling using international healthcare data conservative estimate give annual incidence 2.1 million since decline confirmed human brucellosis case observed european union 0.09 confirmed case per 100,000 population 0.03 e.g human brucellosis infection reported
