reported week 9–15 january last day december 2022–15 january nearly million case almost 53,000 new death reported globally calculating average daily characteristic obtain approximately 400,000–464,000 new daily case 1857–1893 daily death figure ​​are consistent given theoretical estimate sars-cov-2 endemic characteristic discussion necessary emphasize presented estimate refer laboratory confirmed case due high number asymptomatic patient insufficient testing level real number sars-cov-2 case much higher estimate global visibility coefficient let take number case per million 72,524 registered worldwide august day average value 460,834 european country high enough testing level test per caput mean real number case approximately time higher registered figure future reducing testing level lead lower number detected case death restriction accuracy given estimate may related situation mainland china zero-covid policy began lifted november high number new daily case december reported medium look reliable nevertheless better use presented estimation excluding chinese datasets according presented estimation annual mortality caused sars-cov-2 range thousand 1.2 million unfortunately figure higher case seasonal influenza thousand annual death period conclusion thus proposed modified sir model re-infections allowed make adequate estimation equilibrium endemic global daily number sars-cov-2 case related death different country region characteristic different need special investigation take account influence factor e.g. vaccination and/or testing rate complicated mathematical
