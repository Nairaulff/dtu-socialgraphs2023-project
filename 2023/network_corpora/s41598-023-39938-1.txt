introduction european stroke organization published treatment guideline sah thus mainly concentrating aneurysmal sah also treatment nasah integrated differentiating sah perimesencephalic non-perimesencephalic distribution determines therapeutic approach since perimesencephalic nasah associated minor complication rate regarding rebleeding delayed cerebral ischemia dci european stroke organization doe recommend repeated digital subtraction angiography dsa case balancing periprocedural risk chance pathological finding repeated dsa however recommendation guideline limited due lack prospective data therefore survey includes three case vignette encompassing minor moderate severe perimesencephalic nasah represent real-world data neurosurgical department nationwide aim study provide information current management nasah germany indicate suggestion improvement patient care material method study setting paper-based questionnaire sent neurosurgical department germany including question outline case load estimated complication rate mainly focusing information see supplementary file additionally three case vignette presented evaluate treatment follow regime minor

neurosurgical department treating patient per year center 76.3 estimate rate associated complication need treatment ranging survey confirms treatment regime differs center center individually adapted according initial severity nasah clinical presentation every patient center state low complication rate nasah however complication rate literature widely different author reporting complication rate 48.3 including 1.2–4 setting focus associated complication need treatment—the estimated rate complication varying comparable data given literature nevertheless single center study comparing perimesencephalic non perimesencephalic sah detected 8.5 dci 2.8 perimesencephalic sah patient may indicate associated complication underestimated neurosurgical department throughout germany procedural risk 0.3 intra-arterial dsa current guideline doe recommend repeated dsa nasah finding also confirmed huttner co-worker examined patient perimesencephalic sah concluded one dsa performed prior discharge exclude vascular bleeding source well including mostly hunt hess grade patient stated repeated dsa likely become obsolete patient bashir coworkers concluded repeated dsa may obsolete perimesencephalic bleeding pattern hematoma absent first dsa confirmed retrospective evaluation nützel al. published however neurosurgeon answering survey opted minor moderate nasah second dsa confirms clinical practice detection underlying vascular malformation take precedence procedural risk dsa replicated single center study qatar solely including patient two negative dsa study one providing information in-hospital treatment confirming every patient received prophylaxis calcium channel blocker day admission second dsa 7–10 day symptom onset however neither blood pressure management observational regime evaluated european guideline prophylactic application nimodipine recommended due scarce data delayed cerebral ischemia dci nasah thus survey confirms severe nasah statistically significant number center implementing prophylaxis repeated tcd comparing result survey current literature highlight need separate guideline treatment follow-up patient nasah strength limitation survey performed nation-wide conclusion management nasah country may eligible even though response rate high center answered survey therefore conclusion may biased addition number nasah patient per year complication rate objectively reviewed survey mainly focused related complication well dsa complication diagnostics untended conclusion study confirms neurosurgical department throughout germany treat nasah differently initial blood distribution detected scan doe influence clinical treatment therefore suggest conceive new treatment guideline including finding
