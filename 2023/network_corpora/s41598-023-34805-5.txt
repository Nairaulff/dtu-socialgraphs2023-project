scenario may proposed interpret jackie atypical morphology according first hypothetical scenario morphological anomaly observed jackie recorded morphologically atypical jackal might consequence anthropogenic hybridisation previously described jackal-dog admixture case showing unusual phenotypic trait croatia indeed high number wild jackal widespread presence herding dog moving freely within jackal territory repeatedly documented golan height thus potentially increasing probability interspecific admixture however preliminary genetic morphometric analysis carried jackie dna skull showed apparent evidence hybridisation event least last five generation finding suggest particular morphology jackie might due ancient introgressions domestic dog allele almost completely eroded backcrossing generation leaving trace dog ancestry particular genomic region linkage multiple particular coat colour morphologically associated gene thus detectable uniparental autosomal locus analysed future genome-wide study based ancestral chromosomal block reconstruction method could help identify possible dog-derived region along jackie genome potentially reason observed morphological anomaly previously conducted north american grey wolf detect functional 3-bp melanistic deletion along chromosome presumably introgressed via historical admixture dog north american bison bison bison population identify cattle haplotype introgressed genome last year according second hypothetical scenario uncommon feature observed golden height jackal might expression natural variation produced de-novo causal mutation gene related coat colour determination morphological trait i.e. due past admixture dog note shameer colleague suggested coat colour variation either due cross-breeding dog acquired mutation help camouflage jackal free-ranging dog thus possibly helping escape anthropogenic threat implying adaptive trait indeed none analysed sample showed trace dog ancestry morphology-linked gene investigated cbd103 tested part str panel applied individual genotyping however currently known multiple gene simultaneously involved canine morphology coat colour pattern combined effect expressed phenotype colouration also determine direct indirect adaptive advantage different ecological context fact number selection study highlighted latitudinal camouflage advantage densely forested area functional resistance pathogen infection north american european black canid carrying 3-bp deletion β-defensin gene well positive selection increased fitness rate arctic habitat lighter coloured greenland tibetan wolf de-novo mutation potentially responsible lighter white spotted coat colour observed jackie four golan height jackal might randomly originated single individual transmitted subsequent generation circulating among related animal potentially conferring onto adaptive advantage mediterranean semi-desert sparse arboreal vegetation finding might support second scenario multiple de-novo mutation occurrence random independent inheritance course mating carrier individual would confer single anomalous phenotypic trait rather pleiotropic effect multiple feature observed atypical animal study area however preliminary molecular analysis conducted study allow confirm reject hypothesis since despite 3-bp melanistic deletion cbd103 gene gene likely related coat colouration morphology exhaustively typed therefore future genome-wide study could conducted analyse golan height canid using specific targeted dna capture array hoc designed candidate morphology coat colour gene potentially positive selection thus identifying possible island adaptive variation environmentally driven functional variant related local adaptation moreover future research project planned monitor dynamic golan height canid population based genotyping atypical wild individual legally culled found dead study area could surely contribute clarifying existing kinship relationship among therefore shed light spatio-temporal origin spread anomaly however morphological anomaly observed study area i.e. white patch thick long fur upturned tail fig together rarity recorded events—only five wild individual displaying different uncommon feature approximately 12,000 independent sightings—suggest third hypothesis doe contradict previous scenario according hypothesis wild jackal may undergo incipient partial self-domestication process since observed uncommon feature seem coherent characteristic phenotypic change including coat colour variation emerging preliminary stage domestication directional selection demographic explosion jackal population israel also favouring spread anthropic settlement well opportunistic nature specie drive exploit human waste condition could facilitate anthropogenic hybridisation also initiate possible process self-domestication golan height similar hypothesized african wolf neolithic agricultural revolution north africa latter scenario constitutes unique evolutionary cultural phenomenon wild animal modelled domesticated form mutual benefit animal human several theory scheme proposed describe intriguing process domestication although could much complex hitherto hypothesised multiple independent event involving different population taxon different ecological condition indeed jury still whether wild mammal slowly transformed domesticated form around developing human surroundings whether ancestor actively captured tamed first individual later developed domesticated animal case golden jackal result suggest former anthropogenic niche seems driving force whether coat colour variation result genetic mutation favoured human initial selection tameness whether voluntary involuntary selection specific behavioural gene could mediate loss fear towards human still hotly debated anomalous morphological feature convergent domestic dog phenotype observed golan height golden jackal might confer onto bolder behaviour thus better access human food source might provide indirect advantage semi-anthropogenic landscape making suspected proto-domesticated animal accepted feared human scenario proposed interpreting observed morphological anomaly jackie four jackal golan height appear equally possible since preliminary result obtained allow draw definitive conclusion furthermore series limitation associated present study must taken consideration one observed individual showing uncommon feature genetically morphologically analysed since ecological survey study area usually based photo-trapping technique genetic analysis non-invasively collected sample rarely directly associated image captured morphometric analysis could include dog due vast variability among breed absence reliable molecular marker directly associated domestication genetic analysis performed using marker although highly differentiating dog wolf jackal represent moderately resolved snapshot non-coding variability
