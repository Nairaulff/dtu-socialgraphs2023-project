introduction covid-19 pandemic report potentially lethal pandemic new viral infection surfaced wuhan province china late clear early report new disease later known covid-19 severe respiratory complication could alarming lethality rate addition high transmission rate despite several measure virus spread world experienced widespread pandemic covid-19 infection require physical mechanism transmission infected susceptible individual doe physical contact arise individual close enough together long enough pathogen pas one individual another therefore connection individual group individual allow infectious disease covid-19 propagate described network node individual edge infectious attempt transmission event simply individual contact starting several infected node epidemic proceeds transmission edge interaction population define network network generated provide insight epidemiological dynamic part disease control example contact network analysis improve prediction likely distribution infection also identify probable transmission network connection hence treat contain contact thereby reducing spread infection using idea several researcher used network science understand covid-19 transmission dynamic effect control strategy network application epidemiology susceptible-infected-recovered sir model proposed kermack one first epidemiological model considered standard model epidemic spread sir model society divided three state susceptible contains individual vulnerable yet infected infected formed susceptible individual become infected state spread disease recovered consists previously infected individual overcome disease acquired level immunity recovery doe result long-term immunity susceptible-infected-susceptible model may appropriate experience sir model motivated many variation many model incorporate additional state account exposed individual infected yet infectious vaccinated quarantined applying sir model variation existing virus epidemic state contact network selected based characteristic specific disease purpose model contact network changing drastically due expansion air-sea-land transportation range travel speed volume passenger good transported taking pathogen vector according tatem three important consequence expansion global transport network infectious disease pandemic vector invasion event import vector-borne pathogen
