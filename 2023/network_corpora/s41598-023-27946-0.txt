behavioral change trait linked specie currently thrive urban setting shift diet increased boldness reduced neophobia among broadly studied approach understanding type plasticity behavioral ecology

assessing population variation fids house sparrow fids found shorter urban environment compared individual non-urban area european study assessing several bird specie study also reported individual
