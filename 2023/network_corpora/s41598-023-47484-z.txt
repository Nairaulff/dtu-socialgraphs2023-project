cost result study encouraged team continue using cue-based feeding protocol though encouraging result observed first year post-implementation sustained third year concerning several factor including lack awareness experience level new caregiver may contributed increasing awareness cue-based feeding effectiveness implementing structured continued education program regarding use implementing ongoing audit inclusion parent may help sustain improvement timely identification readiness important cue-based feeding protocol shown helpful along skilled caregiver assist infant creating pleasurable feeding experience minimizing stress maximizing intake study add understanding effectiveness cue-based feeding protocol particularly vlbw infant study along existing evidence help make cue-based feeding standard practice nicu cue-based approach help process optimization minimize variability eventually help preterm infant attain feeding milestone appropriately timely fashion study limited single-center retrospective study unable control level training/experience caregiver using protocol change unit policy process may occurred two cohort might impacted feeding readiness length

earlier thus decreasing financial burden patient family health care system sustaining positive result requires time education ownership interdisciplinary approach
