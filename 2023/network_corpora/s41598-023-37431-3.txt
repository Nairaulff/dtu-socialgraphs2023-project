infection human reticulatus removal skin main limitation study low number collected tick however adult reticulatus feed mainly wild ungulate whereas immature forms—on rodent therefore sporadically removed human skin nevertheless last two decade increasing number study reported significant habitat expansion reticulatus tick several european country including poland geographical range expansion reticulatus tick concerning light vector potential high prevalence tick-borne pathogen i.e rickettsia present previous study reticulatus tick showed bimodal activity pattern highest density may–june first half september–november whereas single tick collected summer end august typical tick specie since insectivore small rodent mostly vole mainly host larva nymph adult ticks—medium-sized mammal carnivore sheep goat deer cattle european bison risk bitten reticulatus significantly higher suburban rural area however pattern likely characteristic also ricinus tick specie study woman removed greater proportion reticulatus tick compared men might reflect morphological behavioral physiological difference men woman wilhelmsson co-authors suggested men woman differ capacity rapidly detect
