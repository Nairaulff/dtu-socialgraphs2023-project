introduction since identification severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 december country implemented measure school closure involved nationwide regional closure total partial closure school school either closed grade level working restricted capacity march united nation educational scientific cultural organization estimated country implemented national school closure april student worldwide remote learning rationale school closure followed evidence influenza outbreak reduction social contact student led reduction transmissibility index assumed hold sars-cov-2 however school closure accompanied increased social mixing child adult among child different school might undermine expected effect addition school closures—particularly prolonged—widen inequality disproportionately affecting socially disadvantaged child adolescent group likely access digital technology required remote learning healthy nutritious food choice likely exposed social e.g violence environmental hazard e.g overcrowding residential environment given possible deleterious effect school closure must understand extent transmission school environment fact case sars-cov-2 infection role school spreading infection remains controversial study indicating substantial increase case rate associated school opening others document small impact additionally nationwide population-based seroepidemiological study conducted february march portugal showed seroprevalence child adolescent similar person aged year suggesting similar risk infection addition several tracing study within education setting identified outbreak currently available data quantify magnitude effect children-to-children transmission within classroom school so-called cluster effect detection clustering school classroom would indicate school setting important understanding individual difference infection therefore knowledge may help public health authority direct effort toward specific classroom school

montreal canada circa indiana usa circa however study conducted different time period limit capacity establish direct comparison additionally sars-cov-2 epidemic wave occurred different time country therefore seropositivity population could differ even study conducted time result suggest circumstance careful control contact hygiene measure school setting play small role sars-cov-2 transmission evidenced absence clustering effect school-level school study implemented specific control measure sars-cov-2 mixing student different class approach could potentially explain observe significant school-level effect supporting idea study conducted found sars-cov-2 infection outbreak uncommon educational setting covid-19 school incidence mirrored incidence observed regional community-level also fact seroprevalence time higher student school staff respectively high-risk contact occurred outside school versus 1.1 time higher contact occurred inside school support idea educational setting play small role sars-cov-2 dissemination even individual type contact odds ratio like observed amongst high-risk contact outside school result similar one found milan difference found seroconversion rate

previous study three portuguese public higher education school first national serological survey isncovid-19 ratio approximately 5–6 time higher possible explanation increase availability diagnostic test improved screening compared initial phase pandemic could account lower ratio seroprevalence diagnosed case able evaluate class inclusion school could limited capacity detection school clustering effect nevertheless criterion select municipalities—having high incidence belonging porto metropolitan area—increased power study detect clustering effect besides high participation rate study higher fact sample assembled vaccination school staff student increase relevance result strength finally explore factors—e.g. class size socioeconomic characteristic participant room condition ventilation mask use sun exposure physical distancing hygiene—behind clustering effect observed class level could give important insight additional measure need implemented prevent outbreak within particular classroom another potential limitation presence bias reporting symptom high-risk contact case young child may recall whether experienced symptom study assessment period however effort made mitigate bias collecting information legal guardian predominantly parent additionally possible student school staff aware high-risk situation outside school primarily home could explain stronger association found high-risk contact occurred outside school nevertheless considering clustering effect mor class school level bias likely risk appears significantly smaller confirming school provided safer environment observation school may play small role sars-cov-2 transmission relevant information accurately ponder pro con school opening determine effective measure mitigate transmission school classroom however clustering effect found class level pose additional challenge reduce risk infection among student staff particularly community although directly infer study measure improved ventilation stricter hygiene protocol vaccination promotion screening testing among others might help reduce within-class sars-cov-2 transmission conclusion clustering effect within class within school setting seroprevalence much higher among individual high-risk contact outside school among individual high-risk contact inside school setting finding indicate possible prevent spread outbreak within class rest school community
