introduction new coronavirus covid-19 outbreak began wuhan china towards end december declared global pandemic march following year past two year virus become global problem harming healthcare system economy various country europe first discovered north italy spain quickly spread across continent july estimated 206,490,180 case coronavirus infection 1,858,450 fatality reported europe result high incidence disease europe become second deadliest continent followed north america detection covid-19 outbreak sometimes postponed many week making early decision required intervention challenge great
