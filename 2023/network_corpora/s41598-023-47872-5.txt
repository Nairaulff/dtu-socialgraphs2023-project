introduction covid-19 pandemic brought significant change daily life including quarantine distancing measure resulted increased risk social isolation loneliness people residing covid-19 epicenter prevalence sars-cov-2 highest may higher risk experiencing loneliness result stringent lockdown measure restriction social gathering mandated authority compared residing outside epicenter literature several study reported higher risk mental health problem people living within epicenter compared outside depressive symptom insomnia symptom low level affective cognitive wellbeing however still lack empirical data increased risk loneliness individual residing covid-19 epicenter risk spreading sars-cov-2 individual live visited covid-19 epicenter recently traveled location generally required quarantine may also separated family member currently lockdown epicenter addition people living non-epicenters likely keep distance individual covid-19 epicenter due concern contracting sars-cov-2 despite limited empirical evidence regarding heightened risk loneliness person recently left covid-19 epicenter best knowledge one prior study conducted colleague assessed risk loneliness among individual based location covid-19 outbreak china study observed statistically higher prevalence rate loneliness two group resident living within covid-19 epicenter 25.3 individual recently relocated epicenter currently reside part china 27.2 compared resident region china 23.0 however study primarily focus difference risk loneliness among subpopulation significant subpopulation difference risk loneliness also disappeared subsequent multiple regression analysis worth noting prior study measure loneliness potentially problematic employed single-item measure criticized tendency underreport true feeling loneliness population-based survey january april order prevent spread sars-cov-2 part china wuhan shut inbound outbound transportation implemented stay-at-home policy nine million resident remained city due spring festival holiday panic caused outbreak approximately five million people left wuhan week lockdown order improve planning mental health service covid-19 pandemic crucial identify subpopulation higher risk experiencing loneliness therefore study compared risk loneliness individual residing wuhan covid-19 epicenter china recently left initial outbreak period living non-epicenter region loneliness typically defined negative subjective feeling resulting lack satisfactory quality and/or quantity person social connection important indicator well-being associated increased risk various physical mental morbidity well mortality context pandemic choi colleague argued covid-19 pandemic associated restriction limited opportunity social interaction reduced necessary social support disrupted quality relationship resulted discrepancy individual actual social connection his/her desired connection pandemic directly restricted people social interaction however negative impact varies among different subpopulation pronounced among individual quarantined epicenter recently relocated therefore hypothesized individual residing wuhan china recently left initial outbreak period would face higher risk loneliness compared living non-epicenter region result analysis included epicenter resident left resident non-epicenter resident epicenter resident found statistically older 36.9 11.1 vs. 34.7 9.9 year 0.001 non-epicenter resident left resident statistically younger 29.5 9.2 vs. 34.7 9.9 year 0.001 additionally epicenter left resident

epicenter resident left resident compared non-epicenter resident adjusting covariates using multiple logistic regression analysis full size table discussion best knowledge first study compare likelihood experiencing loneliness among resident underwent lockdown epicenter recently departed epicenter situated non-epicenter region primary finding study indicate prevalence loneliness 53.5 55.2 epicenter recently departed resident respectively higher 43.9 found non-epicenter resident moreover independent relative risk loneliness epicenter recently departed resident significantly greater non-epicenter resident 1.35 1.20 respectively study addressed gap current literature demonstrating significant increase risk loneliness among epicenter recently left resident greater likelihood respectively compared non-epicenter resident finding identify specific subpopulation would benefit targeted psychosocial service reduce risk loneliness among affected outbreak covid-19 infectious disease future relative risk experiencing loneliness three subpopulation comparable relative risk developing mental health problem subpopulation impacted differently covid-19 outbreak specifically depressive symptom among individual residing epicenter well among migrant epicenter comparison living area 1.61 1.56 respectively result strict mass quarantine imposed wuhan expected resident epicenter face greatest risk loneliness even recently left wuhan required undergo medical observation isolation destination site unable reunite family spring festival also possible individual may experience high level social stigma discrimination given label potential sars-cov-2 carrier factor may contribute elevated risk loneliness experienced left resident heightened risk loneliness among epicenter resident left resident comparison non-epicenter resident could attributed increased level social isolation experienced two group result pandemic stringent containment measure implemented despite nationwide containment measure place primary limitation study limited representativeness sample convenience sample individual residing covid-19 epicenter recently left individual living non-epicenter region fact majority participant social medium user potential significant limitation snowball sampling via social medium platform participant may invite others similar value personality join study case ass homophily among participant unable account potential bias determining risk loneliness among subpopulation moreover experience loneliness among chinese individual outbreak may differ country due difference socio-economic cultural context well varying covid-19 containment strategy limited sample may entirely representative broader population could impact generalizability study finding second thoroughly evaluate specific characteristic relocated resident duration migration epicenter geographical distance epicenter destination location additionally plausible quarantine unfamiliar environment could heighten feeling loneliness however gather corresponding data made challenging provide comprehensive explanation increased risk loneliness among relocated resident third account potential factor major medical condition depression anxiety multiple logistic regression analysis ass risk loneliness across three subpopulation reason omission negative emotion absence evidence regarding chronological order depression anxiety loneliness considering significant impact pandemic associated restriction measure inclined believe depression anxiety loneliness outcome pandemic occurred concurrently outbreak therefore argue loneliness likely consequence depression anxiety study fourth qualitative data useful uncovering underlying cause elevated risk loneliness developing comprehensive psychosocial intervention study include qualitative research investigate matter notwithstanding limitation elevated risk loneliness observed individual residing covid-19 epicenter well recently left highlight importance prioritizing mental health service subpopulation outbreak improve psychological wellbeing affected adult period mental health social worker consider implementing periodic screening loneliness mental health problem subpopulation providing timely psychosocial support service need method participant comparative study secondary analysis data large-scale online cross-sectional survey conducted january february survey duration coincided early stage rapid spread covid-19 epidemic lockdown wuhan china due logistical challenge emergency period
