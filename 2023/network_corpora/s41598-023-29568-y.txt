isotope data skin sample taken early 1990s 2010s revealed northward shift foraging location apparent diversification targeted prey time period suggestive change previously preferred foraging habitat and/or prey considering baleen whale body condition directly linked prey abundance data clearly indicative drastic reduction foraging success and/or reduced prey availability prey availability oceanic top predator strongly linked climatic oceanographic process impact change process trophic ecology oceanic predator well documented based whaling data antarctic krill constitutes key food source southern right whale feeding south 50°s however multiple study shown strong inverse relation krill abundance rising sea surface temperature hereafter ssts sea-ice loss due climate change decrease prey

population possible shift diet combined reduction nutritional value southern right whale prey may played role reduction south african southern right whale body condition recent year hypothesis also indirectly eluded previous study investigating southern right whale calf mortality argentina warrant investigation body condition thus foraging success influence reproduction mammal crucial part reproduction including ovulation gestation lactation also case marine mammal various study shown direct relationship exist example reduced prey abundance correlated reduced fecundity killer whale orcinus orca decreased rate pregnancy north atlantic fin whale balaenoptera physalus related prey limitation mediated body condition furthermore calving rate north atlantic right whale eubalaena glacialis correlated various lag abundance copepod calanus finmarchicus poor body condition indicated cause observed long calving interval specie direct relationship also found southern right whale southwest atlantic reproductive success shown dependent prey availability thus foraging success reliance stored energy furthermore illustrated fact southern right whale mother lose body condition first month lactation therefore clear adequate nutrition thus foraging success critical reproductive success southern right whale ultimately ensure continued recovery post-whaling perhaps unsurprising reduced body condition south african southern right whale fall within period increased calving interval observed population indeed although 3-year calving cycle usually predominant specie including one year gestation one year lactation one year rest allow female recover accumulate enough energy reserve support following pregnancy ceased case south african population past decade drastic increase 5-year calving interval became apparent 5-year calving interval may imply either additional resting year build fat reserve successive calving event loss fetus combined available evidence strongly indicative reduced body condition female southern right whale extent affect calving rate furthermore maternal body condition doe affect calving rate also calf juvenile growth rate well age first parturition ultimately affecting population growth although reduced calf condition visible data present finding raise serious concern continued reproductive success population recovery post-whaling
