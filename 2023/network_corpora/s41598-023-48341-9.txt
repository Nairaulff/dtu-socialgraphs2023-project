introduction resource allocation science highly skewed acceptance rate high-prestige journal often ten percent hold true prestigious research grant consequently small fraction researcher publish high-prestige journal receive research grant obtain tenured position peer evaluation key determining receives resource scholar review work determine belongs top doe peer evaluation dominant method divide scarce resource uncontested large literature investigated gender inequality peer evaluation across multitude setting many study find evidence inequality journal peer review score lower woman men receive higher score grant proposal teaching evaluation favorable woman men likely evaluated positively academic hiring literature uniform finding recent study example finding gender inequality journal peer review academic hiring however gender inequality evaluation argued part explanation gender difference academic career female scholar receive lower evaluation male counterpart quality could first argument several study show difference remain even quality kept constant another important argument lie subjective nature evaluation evaluation never objective dissociated evaluator evaluator conception academic excellence neutral gendered likely perceive men top achiever recent study also find evidence gender bias group work woman receive credit contribution homophily evaluator evaluated also argued one key reason gender inequality evaluation particularly context neutral universal criterion distinguish top rest evaluator favorable similar since likelihood evaluate colleague e.g hiring committee grant panel increase seniority strong overrepresentation men amongst senior scholar could reproduce existing gender inequality male evaluator likely evaluate male academic positively article study gender inequality evaluation start academic career looking association gender cum laude distinction phd student netherlands defending dissertation phd student either obtain

empirical case cum laude distinction phd student provides interesting context study gender inequality evaluation three reason first clear criterion define cum laude distinction—this depends evaluator

committee member make assessment accurate prominently current data unable fully rule observed gender inequality cum laude distinction explained something else gender bias might example male phd

gender cum laude distinction future study try triangulate finding controlled design big career advantage obtain cum laude distinction word important difficult quantify graduating cum laude official
