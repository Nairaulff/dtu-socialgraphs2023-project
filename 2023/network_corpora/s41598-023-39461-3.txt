track alveolar presence blood product might serve natural self-sealing agent effectively preventing reducing air-leak pleural cavity induction clotting hemorrhage along needle path could initiate clotting resulting patch-like formation may limit airflow airspace pleural space altered ventilation presence blood product within alveolar space could lead reduction ventilation subsequently decreasing flow air airspace pleural space reduce risk pneumothorax promotion pleural adhesion blood accumulation pleural surface might stimulate adhesion visceral parietal pleura thus preventing formation air pocket could lead pneumothorax increased airway pressure blood alveolar space could increase airway pressure increased pressure might counteract force causing air leak lung thereby reducing occurrence pneumothorax altering lung compliance pulmonary hemorrhage may change lung compliance reduced lung compliance mean lung likely overexpand cause air leak thus reducing risk
