introduction lack feed raw material cost always important factor restricting development animal husbandry industry recent year development utilization new feed resource become urgent problem solved china major producer edible fungi ranking first world annual output pleurotus eryngii commonly called king oyster mushroom valuable edible mushroom among consumer owing unique flavor high nutritional value large-scale intensive production pleurotus eryngii thus caused large quantity spent mushroom substrate pleurotus eryngii smpe utilized effectively smpe remaining medium residue harvesting wide range source low price smpe shown great potential animal feed protein content amino acid composition close corn crude fiber content close roughage excellent neutral feed study shown spent mushroom substrate rich crude fiber crude protein polysaccharide crude fat calcium phosphorus active nutrient new type high-quality feed raw material livestock poultry however spent mushroom substrate fully utilized actual production process present small part developed animal feed directly incinerated discarded waste waste biological resource also cause serious environmental pollution problem therefore rational development utilization technology spent mushroom substrate feed turn waste treasure protect environment also alleviate problem shortage feed resource improve economic benefit animal husbandry industry important ecological significance broad market prospect main component smpe agricultural byproduct high fibre raw material bagasse wheat bran corn flour etc resulting low
