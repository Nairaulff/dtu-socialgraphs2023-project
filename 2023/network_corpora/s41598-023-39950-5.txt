introduction past decade managed grassland worldwide become subject substantial change modified land use including intensification current farming abandonment afforestation conversion arable land driving force behind development abandonment afforestation induce gradual suppression typical grassland specie tall herb shrub tree intensification usually favor plant adapted high nutrient availability frequent cutting land-use change result overall change specie composition reduced biodiversity including loss specialist nutrient-poor soil spread undesired even poisonous specie global warming altered rainfall pattern significantly reinforce accelerate negative development wet grassland particularly affected change since intensive grazing mowing often supported drainage thus specialist specie wet grassland faced two problem i.e. reduced soil moisture increased competition agricultural usage change grassland problematic increasing specie poor nutritional value example native invader poisonous meadow saffron colchicum ragwort specie senecio jacobaea contain cytotoxic colchicine hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid respectively toxic substance cause severe health

endemic central western europe distribution range germany extends coastal lowland montane grassland covering large gradient precipitation temperature southern germany aquatica occurs many region

addition trampling livestock rut caused tractor machinery lead gap vegetation provide beneficial microsites establishment wind-dispersed short-lived specie consequence various study focused development method effectively control poisonous plant e.g recommended avoiding vegetation gap caused heavy machinery livestock trampling water-saturated soil since dense vegetation prevents seedling establishment control aquatica also achieved cutting ripening flower head increased shading denser canopy due reduced mowing manually removing ragwort plant root application herbicide population

pa-n-oxides thus abundant infestation aquatica reported reason farmer lost livestock orkney island contrasting trend observed large part central europe past decade whereas aquatica strongly declined northern germany increasing infestation reported northern pre-alpine grassland switzerland germany austria contradicting development specie also observed lowland alpine foreland bavaria however mechanism behind trend largely unknown since agricultural use lowland grassland grassland pre-alpine region almost similar also difference climate soil condition come question cause opposite development modifying soil moisture temperature humidity concentration climate change significantly impact specie functional diversity wet grassland thus drought-induced global warming may affect
