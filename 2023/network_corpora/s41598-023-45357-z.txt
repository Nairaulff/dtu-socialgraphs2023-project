introduction advent super-aging society japan expectation elderly employed increasing yearly population worker aged year japan increasing proportion total labor force aged year tripled 4.9 12.4 addition employment rate elderly 51.0 aged 65–69 year 33.1 aged 70–74 year 10.5 aged year predicted employment rate elderly japan increase future employment elderly proposed supplement decreasing working-age population curb increasing social security cost perspective care prevention employment elderly lead participation social activity contributes maintenance daily activity addition reduced cognitive decline risk death also associated employment elderly moreover participating paid employment provides sense fulfillment—derived contributing society—for elderly nonetheless 8-year prospective study elderly fujiwara demonstrated working would helpful maintaining basic activity daily living male study analyzed data survey health aging retirement europe reported retirement improved health index however chinese study reported mental health deteriorates employment resumed retirement consensus impact employment elderly various reason working different working style said labor force unlikely decline organization flexible working style maintain occupational safety health among working elderly rise coronavirus disease covid-19 caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 february employment situation elderly changed infectious disease declared pandemic severity illness risk mortality increase age elderly refrained going pandemic according investigation conducted covid-19 emergency physical activity elderly living study area decreased average 26.5 strong concern amount activity decrease risk poor health increase elderly refrain going maintaining high physical intellectual activity level reduces risk frailty word involved social activity employment may positive impact elderly health pandemic however remains unclear whether continuing employment pandemic beneficial effect motor cognitive function compared normal time therefore present study aimed analyze whether presence absence employment affect motor cognitive function

woman among elderly hence clear working scenario male female japan differs greatly younger elderly generation case motor function difference walking speed locomotive 2-step test frailty two group type content employment varied could speculated motor function affected work content particular employee working group 3.0 continued work full-time employee suggesting daily employment characteristic little effect motor function addition previous study reported working individual associated pre-frailty however study found difference number frail participant two group reason could average age participant year younger previous study common reason working found health 30.3 contrast survey showed majority working financial reason difference could due participant study interested getting examined motor cognitive function recruitment limited could engage min daytime weekday therefore difficult generalize examine reason employment limitation study first possible establish causal relationship paid work decline attention function cross-sectional survey hence conducting follow-up survey verify whether attention function could kept high working second investigation carried emergency scenario due pandemic third sample size small additional research needed generalize result fourth lack information underlying disease related motor cognitive function doe rule effect identified herein furthermore although age adjusted final multivariate analysis effect aging must considered limitation study age difference approximately 2.6 year two group however impact employment due emergency scenario still unclear therefore plan re-examine participant analyze detail starting conclusion study showed elderly super-aging society employed covid-19 pandemic high attention function effect employment motor function general cognitive function confirmed study help better management pandemic situation lead improvement quality life among elderly furthermore finding herein may provide basic data intervention study research maintain improve attention function elderly
