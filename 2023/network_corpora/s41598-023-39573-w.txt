introduction spinal mobilisations/manipulation commonly used management people spinal pain systematic review shown spinal mobilisation/manipulation improve pain function short term follow-up may positively affect several neurophysiological biomechanical psychological response however mechanism mediating effect spinal mobilisation/manipulation pain reduction remain poorly understood systemic inflammatory marker high sensitive c-reactive protein hscrp tumor necrosis factor tnf may elevated people persistent neck pain radicular pain immune response may associated pain intensity perceived recovery suggesting spinal pain encompasses inflammatory component systemic inflammation upregulated associated clinical outcome people non-specific neck pain interventional research warranted provide

meaningful difference effect spinal mobilisation/manipulation clinical outcome pain intensity cervical range motion identify difference neuroimmune response systemic level experimental placebo intervention good outcome versus poor outcome experimental group meaningful association pain reduction although found significant difference clinical outcome finding may related type error due multiple testing suggesting significant finding may due chance random variation rather true effect increasing volume literature regarding effect joint mobilisation/manipulation neuroimmune response musculoskeletal condition despite increased number study high quality randomised clinical trial assessing neuroimmune response patient limited result inflammatory marker add current literature showing joint mobilisation/manipulation immediate effect inflammatory marker studied systemic level conflicting result literature potential change serum/salivary cortisol following joint

circadian rhythm fasted state medication use anti-conceptive/estrogen treatment instruction given patient study controlled factor could probably explain difference result previous study ex-vivo inflammatory marker easy measure therefore attractive investigate pain research besides advantage ex-vivo inflammatory marker several disadvantage need listed first cellular source ex-vivo inflammatory marker determined second potential alteration inflammatory marker concentration dilutes systemic circulation third temporal dynamic inflammatory marker might different per patient therefore addition ex-vivo serum determination inflammatory marker whole blood in-vitro evoked release inflammatory marker used in-vitro measurement advantage supernatant collected stimulation contain

result line previous finding joint mobilisation/manipulation affect in-vitro responsivity whole blood cell lipopolysaccharide contrast previous study measured in-vitro responsivity ex-vivo inflammatory marker directly joint mobilisation/manipulation people non-specific neck pain could partly explain discrepancy found one non-randomised controlled trial found week treatment joint manipulation resulted reduction in-vitro responsivity people back pain however healthy participant single session joint mobilisation/manipulation compared placebo mobilisation/manipulation showed immediate time-dependent attenuation evoked release inflammatory cytokine il-1β tnf-α finally recent study patient low back pain showed h-mrs increased choline level thalamus insula somatosensory cortex following several session spinal manipulation compared sham intervention h-mrs choline level linked neuroinflammation result might indicate central neuroimmune response following joint manipulation result point compelling need ass whether several treatment session clinical population localised neuroimmune response longer follow-up period might needed detect change neuroimmune response following joint mobilisation/manipulation one important issue determining in-vitro responsivity whole blood cell control number cytokine producing cell number cell cultured immunophenotyping performed study able normalise in-vitro immune response number monocyte notwithstanding even normalising monocyte count meaningful difference could detected immediate in-vitro neuroimmune response contrast previous study study first study performed extensive phenotyping peripheral blood mononuclear cell cell staining activation marker hla-dr tlr-4 expression monocyte relation joint mobilisation/manipulation negative finding in-vitro whole blood stimulation strengthened find difference cell phenotyping activation marker hla-dr monocyte and/or tlr-4 expression several consideration noted interpreting finding first due non-linearity neuroimmune response ln-transformation necessary make interpretation data complicated second opted unequal sample size also wanted compare people good versus poor outcome within experimental group experimental group needed larger control group baseline however incorporated unequal group size priori sample size estimation thereby limiting type error thirdly effect single session joint mobilisation/manipulation immediate neuroimmune response examined could seem limit clinical relevance give better insight true effect mobilisation/manipulation neuroimmune outcome limiting effect contextual factor moreover aim understand biological mechanism behind pain reduction clinical efficacy mobilisation/manipulation also longer follow-up period might complicate establishing cause-effect relationship intervention systemic neuroimmune response due confounding factor may introduce bias participant control group naïve joint mobilisation/manipulations might affected credibility placebo intervention nonetheless find statistical difference intervention expectation believe minor influence finally two minor protocol deviation needed mentioned first changed label short term effect immediate effect believe post intervention better described still immediate rather short term may reflect day week secondly due omission pain intensity two day recorded conclude found joint mobilisations/manipulation affect immediate systemic neuroimmune response association found neuroimmune response pain reduction revealed joint mobilisations/manipulation effect systemic level inflammation future research may focus localised neuroimmune response e.g. level dorsal root ganglion spinal cord brain demonstrating change neuroimmune response difficult location location may show clearer change demonstrated would show complementary effect joint mobilisation manipulation aerobic exercise neuroimmune response
