age grade classification lymph node status tumor size distant metastasis surgical treatment machine learning increasingly utilized research prediction survival patient cancer relatively favorable result although coxph classical method utilized analysis survival data use method requires linear relationship variable result continuous advance achieved recent year machine learning widely applied medical field study used ensemble machine learning model accurately predict patient lpadc obtained satisfactory result consistent finding reported al. four model developed study confirmed surgery important prognostic factor patient lung adenocarcinoma similarly distant metastasis important impact prognosis patient lpadc conjunction previous analysis finding demonstrate patient developed distant metastasis poorer survival rate patient higher n-stage also play crucial role model indicating poor prognosis characteristic e.g. tumor size grade sex chemotherapy primary site etc different degree importance various model result suggest selection appropriate treatment modality e.g. surgery radiotherapy chemotherapy may important predicting patient lpadc tnm staging alone interestingly ensemble model i.e. est rsf demonstrate markedly better ability predicting lpadc validation cohort compared coxph model indicates machine learning approach may offer advantage traditional model limited therefore several possible explanation comparable predictive performance observed ensemble coxph model study firstly number predictor used construct model sufficiently large advantage machine learning analyzing large sample multivariate data fully realized secondly seer database collect variable derived clinical experience many variable linearly correlated outcome therefore data may better qualified application parametric coxph model est rsf model developed study achieved predictive efficacy coxph model broader condition web calculator constructed study based training dataset care taken applying est model may overconfident hence recommended use algorithm prediction survival study coxph model poorer long-term predictive power ensemble model therefore use rsf model recommended prediction lpadc beyond year study several limitation firstly seer database lack data regarding established predictor survival patient lpadc e.g. chemotherapy regimen biological marker secondly due retrospective nature study data processing sample missing information excluded may led considerable bias thirdly work related measurement prediction model error study yet complete finally result study externally validated although randomly split study sample development model generalizability reliability approach validated external datasets prognostic value approach improved future adding predictor increasing external validation conducting prospective study conclusion geometric model coxph model developed evaluated prediction patient lpadc overall four model showed excellent discriminative calibration capability particular rsf model model showed excellent consistency long-term forecasting integrated web-based calculator offer possibility easily calculate patient lpadc providing
