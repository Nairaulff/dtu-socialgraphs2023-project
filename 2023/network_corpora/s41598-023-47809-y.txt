seen declining test positivity study period decline incidence attributed increased art coverage scaled-up effort identify case systematic review found although incidence rate generally higher among male female male likely access care result consistent study south africa found male frequently tested compared female age several contributory factor exist social pressure ignore symptom illness stigma conversely woman likely attend health facility reproductive health service increasing chance testing since undiagnosed likely major driver transmission finding innovative way increase testing among men critical reducing south africa people aged 15–44 years—males females—had higher test positivity age group respective sex stratum indicating particular under-diagnosis age group consistent study may part due working aged people able access health service due work service open innovative active case-finding method example placing mobile diagnostic service workplace transport terminal may help increase testing among age group recent south african prevalence survey found particularly under-detected among people without hiv suggested group need testing result support conclusion demonstrate consistency across time geographic location plhiv virally suppressed higher test positivity virally suppressed plhiv reflecting known biology plhiv art high disease risk however virally suppressed plhiv similar risk developing without hiv considered tandem test positivity male without hiv particularly risk receiving testing difference apparent among female identifying opportunity active case-finding among male complex even harder among without hiv interact healthcare service may seek care symptom severe plhiv understandably prioritized testing study re-enforces need strategy active case finding among hiv uninfected population especially male systematic targeted universal testing tuberculosis tutt implemented randomized trial found increase diagnosis per month compared prior year implementing routine testing individual documented hiv infection close contact diagnosed prior two year south african prevalence survey found 57.7 people bacteriologically confirmed initially screened positive chest x-ray alone without symptom incorporating chest x-ray currently part screening algorithm often particularly targeted towards specific group could help close testing gap observed study strength use national testing hiv data consisting around million test five year allowing stratify age sex province hiv viral suppression status critical tool understanding receiving bacteriological testing across south africa limitation include absence individual identifier resulting possible false match record linkage algorithm however algorithm rigorously validated high sensitivity specificity thus error unlikely systematically biased result also data include laboratory test sought care could produce sputum sample many plhiv produce sputum sample therefore people diagnosed based clinical sign symptom alone anyone undiagnosed would included data furthermore individual positive symptom screen tested symptom screening known low sensitivity plhiv beginning art also engage care higher frequency likely receive test likely receive multiple different test increasing chance testing positive also lowering test positivity using testing period rather individual test mitigates bias plhiv still receiving test thus opportunity test positive positive testing period possible nationwide rollout xpert influenced result however result excluding appendix table a19 show similar trend result including table finally consider two possible source misclassification laboratory confirmation absence hiv infection could introduce misclassification additionally note seemingly low percentage virally suppressed plhiv study compared thembisa model estimate may due individual lacking viral load test confirm viral suppression thus classified may exacerbated occasional blip viral load measurement occur due variety reason finally acknowledge data end linkage algorithm used data currently implemented routine data flow use scale proved challenging interim data providing critical guidance policy change since tutt universal test treat call increased screening pregnancy continue focus resource towards woman plhiv exacerbating trend show data provide baseline
