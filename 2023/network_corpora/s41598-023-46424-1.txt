introduction identification bacterial co-infection hospitalised patient coronavirus disease covid-19 posed challenge since pandemic inception early-stage study meta-analyses consistently documented low bacterial co-infection rate upon patient admission although study associated bacterial co-infection adverse outcome -such heightened mortality need mechanical ventilation prolonged hospital stays- however data predisposing risk factor bacterial co-infection remain scarce recent meta-analysis data revealed antibiotic usage prevalence exceeding 70.0 among covid-19 patient first month pandemic

contrast study lower co-infection rate detection pneumoniae antigen urine performed fewer patient conversely study conducted barcelona among hospitalized covid-19 patient pandemic initial year reported co-infection rate approaching author hypothesised elevated percentage could stem diagnostic test requested solely case clinical suspicion another explanation revolves around cessation lockdown pandemic initial month potentially facilitating increased community transmission microorganism like pneumoniae although present study cover similar period aforementioned study eligible

epidemiology respiratory bacterial co-infections may differ across geographic area conclusion respiratory bacterial co-infection low large cohort hospitalised covid-19 patient although could lead worse outcome patient addition percentage patient empirical antibiotic treatment remained high even though declined initial phase pandemic furthermore empirical antibiotic treatment show exhibit
