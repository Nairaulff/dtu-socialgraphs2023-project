transmission hospital environment one crucial source airborne transmission hospital environment aerosol-generating medical procedure aerosol-generating medical procedure procedure produce airborne

aerosol-generating medical procedure surgical procedure endoscopy surgical community many controversy safety performing non-urgent surgery patient sars-cov-2 infection especially targeted potentially greater risk sars-cov-2 transmission open surgery due higher concentration smoke abdominal cavity course time several study showed procedure could provide better control elimination produce surgical smoke open surgery given special filtering mechanism implemented present study surgical smoke air sample negative sars-cov-2 infected patient open procedure many study tackling idea sars-cov-2 aerosolization open procedure none collected surgical smoke sample analyzed presence sars-cov-2 particle hand several study screened presence sars-cov-2 open peritoneal fluid could linked potential aerosolization sars-cov-2 particle sars-cov-2 positive negative peritoneal fluid sample reported led inconclusive statement sars-cov-2 transmission surgical smoke however many urgent surgical procedure standardized cholecystectomy appendectomy smoke evacuation filtration system used open procedure offer unique advantage able almost entirely contain surgical smoke abdominal cavity combination tightly fitting laparoscopic port evacuation system used minimize release potential airborne virus environment simultaneously evacuating surgical smoke contrast smoke evacuation open surgical procedure containment surgical smoke challenging impossible goal evacuate surgical smoke completely current literature three study report sars-cov-2 surgical smoke one study collected surgical smoke one patient appendectomy although surgical smoke sample negative sampling methodology could verified since author used improvised 3-way circuit stop-valve trocar site attached syringe saline solution furthermore surgical smoke collected three time procedure without mentioning long collecting phase took second study concluded sars-cov-2 present surgical smoke detecting sars-cov-2 patient undergoing trocar valve filter one two patient positive filter sample value 42.75 without concomitant positive nasopharyngeal sample author address discrepancy result test infectivity positive trocar filter sample third study haddadin reported similarly first study collection surgical smoke using improvised sampling tube fluid collector attached trocar site patient undergoing without detecting sars-cov-2 sample yokoe conducted model experiment evaluate possibility lowering transmission risk sars-cov-2 filtration surgical mask author used vacuum system obtain surgical smoke hydrosol infected hela-ace2-tmprss2 cell human coronavirus 229e hcov-229 incised electric ultrasonic scalpel found viral rna within induced surgical smoke without proven infectivity hypothesized treating cell culture surgical device damage viral particle resulting loss infectivity hand hcov-229 might similar stability sars-cov-2 phylogenetically distinct could lead poor transferability study sars-cov-2 in-vivo infected cell furthermore clinical aspect induction surgical smoke cell tissue primarily intentionally infected sars-cov-2 therefore contain potentially fewer viral particle consequently could sars-cov-2 detected surgical smoke open procedure due low number sars-cov-2 viral particle tissue present study collected air sample approximately toward end surgery sars-cov-2 infected patient undergoing open procedure air sample contain sars-cov-2 viral particle barberá-riera tested sample collected three week inside two l/min quartz filter author tested mentioned aerosol sample three laparoscopy filter sars-cov-2 genetic material despite low concentration reported 11.3 aerosol sample positive sars-cov-2 genetic material however three laparoscopy filter sars-cov-2 negative raising question source air contamination author speculated aerosol-generating medical procedure open surgery could potential source air contamination however another source could also healthcare worker asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection present study show sars-cov-2 presence air sample open procedure surgical smoke therefore likely source air contamination came aerosol-generating medical procedure open surgery instead contamination could easily appear aerosol-generating medical procedure intubation asymptomatic healthcare worker transmission study detected one sars-cov-2 positive intraperitoneal swab patient acute colon perforation underwent urgent open abdominal surgery since several study reported sars-cov-2 fecal sample could sars-cov-2 contaminated abdominal cavity colon perforation however also report two sars-cov-2 positive peritoneal fluid sample patient undergoing urgent abdominal surgery without visceral perforation hand jakimiuk tested peritoneal fluid sample sars-cov-2 patient undergoing cesarian section peritoneal fluid sample sars-cov-2 negative flemming could prove presence sars-cov-2 peritoneal fluid sars-cov-2-infected patient undergoing emergency cholecystectomy none study conducted sars-cov-2 infectivity testing mentioned positive sample four sars-cov-2 patient diarrhea one first symptom increased expression ace2 receptor detected gastrointestinal tissue patient gastrointestinal symptom sars-cov-2 infection ace2 expression surface cell gastrointestinal tract could mediate invasion amplification virus causing gastrointestinal symptom could explain presence virus patient stool sample reported study although high expression ace2 receptor gastrointestinal tract probably cause sars-cov-2 gastrointestinal symptom still uncertain affect viral spread abdominal surgery study main limitation small sample size especially within subgroup single-center nature study small sample size due indication surgical treatment sars-cov-2 infected patient difficulty including patient multi-centric setting covid-19 pandemic another important aspect observed study high value sars-cov-2 patient time surgery could potentially affect outcome sars-cov-2 group study underwent mostly emergency surgery due complication occurred rather late sars-cov-2 infection phase secondary sars-cov-2 sepsis-related coagulation disorder would interesting examine sample collected high-infectivity phase patient low value compare current outcome furthermore patient sars-cov-2 group gastrointestinal symptom diarrhea could potentially influence detection virus sample abdominal surgery fig another limiting factor study one sars-cov-2 negative nasopharyngeal pcr test sars-cov-2 group sampled surgery patient included study according sars-cov-2 positive nasopharyngeal pcr test admission day two day surgery could due low infectivity patient time surgery could affect study outcome another potential reason negative pcr test could insufficient sampling quality despite professionally trained staff study showed detectable viral particle sars-cov-2 surgical smoke sampled open surgery thus discussed risk transmission sars-cov-2 via surgical smoke could confirmed present study however given paucity data taking precaution reasonable since viral particle aerosolized intubation extubation possible offer opportunity better containment filtration surgical smoke compared laparotomy continues offer health benefit particularly current pandemic hospital resource well minimizing viral exposure risk critical moderating public health crisis
