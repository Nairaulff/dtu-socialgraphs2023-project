effective increasing public copd awareness study came limitation affect generalizability result mainly two using online method limited targeted population high educational level high rate respondent health- care related work education study indicate estimated awareness copd syrian population study probably overestimated majority young university student graduate attempted minimise effect dividing sample two group basing result mainly respondent studying/working health-related field medicine pharmacy dentistry nursery reduce effect medical background result possible another limitation regarding using convenient sampling method used method gathering sample entire community possible aimed wide possible community test knowledge copd missing data question response rate question exceeded accurate
