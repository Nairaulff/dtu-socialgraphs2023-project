introduction mussel farming provides 1/3 aquaculture product one spatially-extended sea farming production europe overall considered sustainable aquaculture industry mussel filter-feeders able feed suspended organic matter without additional food supply low-feeding requirement make ecological footprint mussel aquaculture much lower cultured specie moreover mussel enhance organic matter flow water column bottom strengthen pelagic-benthic coupling fact act efficient collector particulate organic matter promoting settling seabed organic biodeposit although may cause negative side effect impacting locally benthic community may also represent additional food source specie tolerant organic pollution interface deposit feeder hence considering wide spatial extension mussel farming
