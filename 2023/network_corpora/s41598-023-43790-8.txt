introduction fall leading cause unintentional injury older individual often causing hospitalization death approximately individual year old fall least year risk factor include lower-body weakness impaired balance rollators four-wheeled walker often prescribed patient needing gait assistance reduce lower-limb loading compensate weakness injury improve balance aim empower residual motor capacity facilitate natural locomotion rollator user shift load lower body upper body increase base support using handle additional contact point however rollators paradoxically also found risk factor fall yet clear underlies increased fall risk rollator usage affect movement coordination different task evaluation rollator usage mostly limited spatiotemporal parameter walking furthermore recent review point lack data gait aid prescription relative fall risk balance performance older individual start walking often need stand sitting position sit afterward hence standing sitting fundamental task daily life essential mobility indeed non-disabled adult stand 60–100 time day device like sit-to-stand lift rail exoskeleton available provide specific assistance standing device disadvantage expensive needing installation space battery power outlet thus many situation individual may want need use rollator stand sit however transition standing sitting complex difficulty standing correlate risk falling

sit-to-stand stand-to-sit transfer home-dwelling adult year transitioning sitting standing becomes demanding increasing age mostly due change muscle composition decline motor control knee hip

contact point foot buttock unstable dynamic movement com outside base support standing base support smaller com higher two contact point used sitting requires balanced smooth transition com foot onto chair seat however sitting assumed simply opposite standing sitting performed with—rather against—gravity transition phase begin trunk flexion standing stable position sitting thus three question arise complex movement executed rollator use improve transition sitting standing first standing individual observed use different strategy leaning sliding forward upper body flexion moving foot backward pushing arm armrest foot remain parallel unchanged throughout standing two main strategy observed forward leaning momentum transfer strategy dominant vertical rise strategy also called force control strategy forward leaning strategy individual use upper body generate forward momentum smoothly transferred mostly vertical momentum seat-off extending knee hip thereby thorax abdomen pelvis rotate direction forward lean energy transferred thorax thigh mechanical energy flow result knee torque reduced compared rise solely lower-body muscle vertical rise strategy latter trunk stay relatively vertical throughout movement com show anterior upward movement downward movement rise forward leaning strategy generally said efficient strategy healthy individual demonstrated various study especially efficient reduces knee torque compared rising without help upper body momentum enough muscle strength knee extensor one dominant factor successful transfer rollator may help individual use advantageous forward leaning strategy force required still perform movement safely secondly described earlier sitting also complex movement assumed simply opposite standing therefore even surprising sitting little described biomechanical literature let alone using rollator possibly different strategy sitting may also influenced rollator use thirdly observational study often described arm use transitioning sitting standing however arm movement rarely described biomechanical analysis since mostly restricted standardization purpose yet arm swing push might play vital role easing generation horizontal vertical momentum indeed wretenberg found reduction hip knee load respectively participant could push armrest aging muscle often weaken meaning healthy older individual stand without using arm seat knee height make armrest necessity hence arm play major role generating propulsive force standing compensate deficit lower body strength also additional contact point hand help maintain balance somatosensory input tactile proprioceptive haptic cue walking standing shown touching plate railing fingertip improves balance rather offering mechanical support allowing strong interaction force support van der kruk recently observed preference arm use likely related perception stability fear falling thus rollator handle could greatly simplify standing sitting via mechanical and/or proprioceptive support however study include arm biomechanical analysis used armrest rather rollator handle armrest low directly lateral trunk sitting contrast anterior-lateral high rollator
