introduction education nutrition key component overall wellbeing contribute significantly health human capital economic theory established role better nutritional educational outcome enhancing human capacity therefore factor together important overall growth individual inequality educational outcome profound impact health outcome population risk especially child earlier study shown child greater risk inhibited growth multiple morbidity early death due nutritional deficiency malnutrition retard physical cognitive growth child also impact productivity later life however better nutrition lower risk child morbidity mortality healthy child perform better various wellbeing outcome including educational attainment later life multiple individual socio-demographic factor impact child malnutrition include age mother birth order gender child place residence wealth status similarly socio-geographical factor like caste religion region also account significant impact child malnutrition various study identified multiple factor determining acute malnutrition among child individual contextual factor like food insecurity inadequate care unhealthy environment mother illiteracy result acute malnutrition among child factor pointedly related child malnutrition decomposition factor key variable like education particularly mother scarce emergent literature although place residence wealth index studied detail study examined nutritional deficiency five child across educational attainment mother malnutrition among five child important social public health concern developing country despite reduction poverty level increasing economic growth million child age five suffering nutritional deficiency globally malnutrition account percent death directly indirectly among five child around half death occur mainly due acute malnutrition child low weight height therefore child stunting greater likelihood death compared nutritional deficiency india percent child suffer severe acute malnutrition although prevalence decreased decade still long way term achieving target set sustainable development goal mother education attributed significantly reduction malnutrition among child study shown disparity maternal education remain key factor determining stunting among five child however intensity impact mother educational attainment child stunting indian setting hardly examined moreover study regional level extremely scarce despite evidence contribute significantly child malnutrition indian therefore informed understanding causal relationship child stunting differential mother educational attainment inevitable conversant policy intervention regional level backdrop present paper study determinant child malnutrition difference educational attainment mother jammu kashmir estimate contribution various factor stunting apart mother educational attainment differential thereof also provided data methodology method study data 5th round nationally representative national family household survey nfhs-5 state jammu kashmir extracted data five child alongside household attribute used nfhs employ multi-scale stratified sampling design household sampling unit nfhs-5 sample designed provide estimate key indicator national state level well estimate key indicator district level dependent variable estimation first employed height age z-score haz proxy measuring stunting haz minus two standard deviation mean child growth standard categorized stunted exposure variable mother education important determinant child health nfhs collect detailed information mother education purpose present study mother education divided two category mother formal education literate illiterate set individual characteristic age gender birth order birth size also used control variable impact socioeconomic factor like caste religion wealth region child stunting among five child also reported statistical analysis univariate multivariate analysis carried study result descriptive statistic generated present distribution respondent educational difference mother binary logistic regression estimated test association independent variable dependent variable

jammu kashmir nfhs-5 full size image discussion work tried study impact mother educational difference stunting among five child jammu kashmir result clearly demonstrate child whose mother formal schooling greater risk experiencing poor nutritional status using oaxaca technique study found difference educational outcome mother explains 26.48 percent variation stunting among child five stunting major public health challenge affecting million child globally educational difference among mother generate significant variation impact child health outcome socioeconomic difference also account significant change nutritional outcome child study provides empirical evidence difference likely due structural compositional factor higher prevalence stunting among child five illiterate mother highlight role educational inequality shaping stunting level jammu kashmir study first kind context jammu kashmir study across india identified maternal education significant determinant stunting particularly difference income social class work outcome socioeconomic inequality evident household level therefore child belonging poorer household living rural area demographic characteristic mother child result lower intake nutrient therefore likely influence stunting level thus adjusting difference educational outcome mother result show strong difference stunting level result corroborate earlier study mother without formal schooling associated higher stunting level among five child hence greater educational attainment mother appears mitigating impact stunting level among under-five child difference stunting explained causal link education mother nutritional wellbeing child higher level education augment ability mother afford good nutrition child also enhances awareness pro con better nutrition mother education also provides mean promote breastfeeding equitable excess nutritious food critical reducing stunting level identified earlier study socio-economic factor critical increasing nutrition among five child across population studying role predictor separately factor like child age gender birth order religion place residence critically contribute nutritional deficiency among child finding therefore well line earlier study stunting major health challenge significant impact health wellbeing five child educational inequality strong likelihood affecting nutritional outcome child apart individual contextual factor finding consistent earlier literature better socio-economic outcome associated better nutritional outcome therefore important population facing stunting challenge large gap mother education focus new set policy target individual socioeconomic characteristic individual emphasized also strong focus provided upon compositional structure effect likely key nutritional variation across child conclusion paper examines difference educational outcome mother stunting level child jammu kashmir result reveal gap stunting across different socio-economic geographical factor likely due unexplained contribution however distributional effect also implies significant gap stunting among child belonging mother educational inequality result clearly reflects upon importance mother education nutritional deficiency urge strong policy intervention direction sum study decomposed educational inequality mother examine impact nutritional outcome child particularly stunting study clearly show immediate need policy incentive emphasis factor shape determinant particularly intervention focusing socio-economic characteristic mother
