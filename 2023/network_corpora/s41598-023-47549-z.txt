introduction sub-saharan africa pneumonia leading cause infection-related death people year age responsible approximately 200,000 death annually burden hiv infection south africa high estimated million adult living hiv adult living hiv 25-fold greater risk developing pneumonia increased risk hospitalization 13–19-fold death 1.5-fold greater case-fatality ratio compared age-matched hiv-uninfected adult despite high burden pneumonia etiology many pneumonia case remains unknown due limitation test sensitivity specificity well inappropriate specimen type available establishing definite diagnosis gold standard culture method commonly used determining cause pneumonia lack sensitivity result often negative due antimicrobial usage prior sampling furthermore usefulness sampling upper respiratory tract urt limited pathogen identified common colonizer urt thus making difficult attribute causality etiology pneumonia therefore sputum lung aspirate pleural fluid gold standard

clinician-diagnosed pneumonia nanofluidic qpcr method able detect pcv13 vaccine serotypes spiked urine sample failed detect pneumococcus clinical sample whereas urine antigen test lyta qpcr method able detect pneumoniae sample respectively unclear nanofluidic qpcr method unable detect pneumococcus urine sample tested possible explanation include bacterial load pneumococcus present urine may low therefore detection limit reaction set 100–1000 cfu/ml include assay small input sample volume 2.5ul might compounded low bacterial load issue might explain lyta qpcr method higher input volume 10ul detected pneumococcus high limited number sample iii high antibiotic usage cohort may inhibited bacterial growth organism detected blood culture majority participant blood sample available culture concentration urea might high enough sample inhibit qpcr preventing primer annealing especially dehydration common side effect pneumonia result increased level urea urine urine sample tested study stored three year testing could result formation crystal calcium oxalate uric acid amorphous phosphate could degraded pneumococcal dna finding urine antigen method study similar previous study done setting reported pneumococcus adult hospitalized pneumonia albeit higher compared study italy thailand reported pneumoniae 8–11 hospitalized adult cap respectively furthermore urine antigen test study found sensitive detecting pneumoniae compared method result interpreted caution study found proportion patient positive blood sputum culture negative antigen test antigen may cross-react closely related streptococci specie urine antigen positive week onset disease nevertheless urine antigen method able identify additional pneumococcal case missed routine culture future study consider using method conjunction improve diagnosis pneumococcal pneumonia study limited chest x-ray available participant routinely used confirm physician diagnosis pneumonia thus study could potentially included non-pneumonia case furthermore subset sample included final analysis blood sample collected culture none positive pneumococcus lastly include inhibitor control qpcr setup may controlled presence urea sample conclusion nanofluidic qpcr method useful identifying pneumoniae urine sample despite able detect serotype pneumoniae nasopharyngeal swab sample using urine antigen test able report overall

urine investigation needed develop alternative method diagnose pneumococcal pneumonia adult
