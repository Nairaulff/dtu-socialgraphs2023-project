introduction covid-19 outbreak first documented december wuhan china according world health organization report sars-cov-2 virus already caused 771,549,718 confirmed case covid-19 6,974,473 death october 25th october 21th total 13,533,465,652 vaccine dos administered worldwide meanwhile iran morbidity mortality rate 7,619,981 146,480 respectively total 155,445,801 vaccine dos administered august time safe effective vaccine added emergency use list multiple vaccine received authorization emergency use national and/or international regulator meanwhile vaccine distribution developing country slow close optimal vaccination coverage result vast group unvaccinated people may play critical role covid-19 circulation lead new variant evolution potentially vaccine-resistant swift worldwide mass vaccination efficient vaccine invaluable sars-cov2 pandemic mutation spike protein potentially increased transmission virus likelihood escape antibody raised parental sequence used

higher immunity interval first second dose second dosage significant difference found among different vaccine platform concluded sars-cov-2 vaccine unable prevent infection significantly reduce mortality rate result line finding higher anti-sars-cov-2 anti rbd igg detection rate titer astrazeneca recipient obvious antibody titer post-infection vaccination cause range protective effect specifically reducing mortality rate study estimated required neutralizing antibody titer completely prevent symptomatic viral infection approximately sixfold higher compared required prevent severe outcome sars-cov-2 infection study assessed antibody participant infected infected early pandemic alfa delta variant circulation time assessment serum antibody activity first dose sars-cov-2 vaccination september showed participant previously confirmed infection vaccine group overall significantly higher amount antibody titer demonstrated rbd-based elisa assay except coviran barekat group might due low number infected person group 7.09 moreover coviran barekat recipient prior infection history produce antibody first vaccine administration considering young year old female year old male might non-responders impact two sample magnified small fraction therefore used whitney test vaccine group order investigate impact infection history led non-significant p-value coviran barekat group finding confirmed additional antigenic exposure improves antibody efficacy sars-cov-2 variant protective antibody prior infection without vaccination induced antibody spike protein interfere function antibody response crucial aspect adaptive immunity viral infection based predominant isotypes profile somatic hypermutations antibody humoral immune response divided two phase extrafollicular phase cell activated quickly differentiate plasma cell focus outside follicle within day infection produce antibody contain somatic hypermutations still reasonably high affinity neutralize virus another study revealed chance reinfection significantly lower individual tested positive antibody furthermore getting vaccinated sars-cov-2 infection enhances impact response research found neutralizing antibody present people infected sars-cov-2 believed antibody could provide strong protection infection reinfection individual without covid-19 infection history vaccinated previously many scientist concern waning neutralizing antibody titer induced prior infection vaccination besides continuous emerge new variant concern voc sars-cov-2 due broad spread frequent mutation caused several neutralizing antibody lose antiviral activity however neutralizing antibody recognize different epitope spike protein neutralize new vocs result pervious immunity induced infection vaccine might alleviate infection suggested order decrease voc chance escape vaccine induced neutralizing antibody future vaccine must consider different group epitope rbd next step develop vaccine able prevent infection completely mucosal immunity inducing vaccine might effective preventing infection restricting viral transmission however still number obstacle overcome reach full potential mucosal vaccine successful protecting disease still limitation risk associated clinical development one concern mucosal surface frequently exposed harmless foreign substance commensal lead tolerogenic immune program may result weak induction pro-inflammatory response effective adjuvant help break tolerance however limited mucosal adjuvant safe human use many require testing demonstrate safety efficacy additionally antigen dilution hinder vaccine delivery mucosal surface ciliated cell quickly clear away debris pathogen protective mucous layer study previous infection history significantly related higher anti sars-cov-2 anti rbd igg titer p-value 0.001 first dose p-value 0.002 second dose many study subscribe theory state infection history boost vaccine effectiveness lead increase antibody titer furthermore shorten interval vaccine injection rise antibody titer categorizing participant based sex age significant difference observed median antibody titer astrazeneca clinical trial phase 2/3 data shown significant difference neutralizing antibody titer among different age group second dose injection data also demonstrated neutralizing antibody detected among participant day second dose injection however another meta-analysis including approximately million participant study found vaccine effectiveness prevention severe sars-cov-2 infection significantly lower among participant older year old might due fact different vaccine type investigated study since investigated mrna-based vaccine johnson johnson vaccine moreover study aim evaluate antibody titer among university staff student leading participant year old younger may result limitation limitation study consider child elderly citizen cell-mediated immune response assessed last least participant first sampling return partake second round although emergence new vocs waning neutralizing activity vaccine faced researcher dilemma often administer sars-cov-2 vaccine importantly safe repeated injection study need address problem safety efficacy developed under-development vaccine sars-cov-2 achievable real-world survey conclusion study demonstrated astrazeneca vaccine induced higher humoral immunogenicity compared inactivated vaccine coviran barekat sinopharm since positive case antibody presence higher antibody also result study agreeing several study indicated infection-induced immunity combined vaccination result higher level protection covid-19 may prevent severe illness hospitalization mortality therefore finding suggested vaccination may crucial people infected sars-cov2 method study
