study shown significant difference iron status male female girl especially adolescent high demand iron maintain physical psychological development knowledge study evaluated relationship serum ferritin neurodevelopmental function sex-specific fashion may associated sex difference hepcidin level regulate neuronal ferroptosis cognitive dysfunction remains unclear sex difference affect outcome considering sex difference important developing preventive strategy adverse neurodevelopmental effect due iron deficiency study several limitation key limitation use database hospital information system consistent similar study data may incomplete missing participant included using non-random population-based sampling representativeness data may influenced selection bias although carefully adjusted potential confounding factor analysis database record necessary confounders iron supplementation dietary habit therefore adjust analysis conclusion study highlight association serum ferritin
