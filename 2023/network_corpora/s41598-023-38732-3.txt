introduction peripheral nerve injury lead motor dysfunction particularly case long nerve defect injured peripheral nerve regenerate spontaneously however degeneration neuromuscular junction muscle atrophy caused long-term denervation misdirection regenerating axon inhibits motor function recovery even axon reach endplate therefore approach promoting regeneration need developed macrophage play important role axonal regeneration injury macrophage recruited injury site phagocytose degenerated axon myelin debris furthermore macrophage secrete several protein axon guidance molecule neurotrophic
