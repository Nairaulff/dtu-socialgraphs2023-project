egg trichuris ascaris found overall 32/35 palaeofaecal sample investigated revealed egg intestinal helminth trichuris abundant detected sample fourteen sample also contained egg ascaris one sample contained ascaris egg importantly egg genus detected coprolite bronze iron age thus based current archaeological dating sampling site stated certainty hallstatt miner infested whipworms roundworm least period 1,158 actual parasite burden prehistoric miner even general population hallstatt difficult ass however result also previous study indicate helminth rather common time light infestation worm usually cause symptom people heavy infestation child may suffer abdominal pain diarrhoea rarely also severe symptom worm comparably large excreted die assumed miner knew preserved leaf butterbur petasites officinalis petasites paradoxus found mine still today used folk medicine treat abdominal pain worm specie soil-transmitted helminth sth without intermediate host adult female worm producing thousand egg daily shed human stool egg mature soil infective egg taken orally via contaminated hand food next human host depending external condition take around 3–6 week egg become infective occurrence roundworm whipworms indication poor sanitation hygiene hallstatt particularly iron age hygiene condition mine obviously low cooking eating defecation accomplished spot corroborated fact palaeofeces found distributed throughout salt mine far one larger pile palaeofaeces found mining area namely kernverwässerungswerk site might indicate spot used constant temperature comparably high humidity prevails inside mine prehistoric miner worked closely together working group thus condition favourable survival transmission helminth egg ascaris trichuris among common helminth found paleoparasitological sample together hookworm still common helminth human today although longer endemic part europe including austria worldwide approximately 807-1,121 million people infested ascaris approximately 604–795 million trichuris egg trichiura also detected intestinal sample famous frozen iceman mummy found ötztal alp dated 1st half 4th mil interestingly egg intestinal helminth found study particularly egg parasite associated consumption meat fish previous study coprolite salt mine structure resembling egg taenia dibothriocephalus latus diphyllobothrium latum found could reliably
