introduction blepharitis chronic inflammatory condition eyelid frequently encountered clinical practice etiology disorder complex fully understood consensus bacteria inflammation contribute pathology due chronic condition permanent cure possible case subjective symptom may persist recur even clinical condition improved blepharitis classified anterior posterior blepharitis according anatomical classification anterior blepharitis affecting base eyelash eyelash follicle posterior blepharitis affecting meibomian gland clinical classification anterior blepharitis traditionally subcategorized staphylococcal seborrheic blepharitis posterior blepharitis clinically synonymous meibomian gland dysfunction mgd although established guideline regarding therapeutic regimen american academy ophthalmology aao preferred practice pattern recommends combination staged treatment topical/systemic antibiotic topical corticosteroid lid hygiene/warm compress however guideline state treatment three form staphylococcal blepharitis seborrheic blepharitis mgd blepharitis indicates understanding blepharitis pathophysiology still infancy hand well known significant number patient undergo cataract surgery suffer postoperative discomfort irritation pain dryness burning sensation foreign body sensation various report indicated potential involvement dry eye disease mgd postoperative discomfort due improved surgical outcome extremely elevated patient expectation recent cataract surgery postoperative discomfort often major disappointment patient stated earlier mgd posterior blepharitis involvement postoperative discomfort cataract surgery well documented however little known regarding involvement anterior blepharitis cataract surgery report described detail anterior

discussion reported cataract surgery worsen blepharitis meibomian gland function postoperative period result increased ocular discomfort decreased vision patient satisfaction however report describe posterior blepharitis/mgd little known anterior blepharitis cataract surgery paper describes first time clinical manifestation anterior blepharitis cataract surgery therapeutic efficacy topical azithromycin patient studied period approximately cataract surgery performed hospital case showed anterior blepharitis suggesting incidence anterior blepharitis cataract surgery approximately cause dry eye meibomian gland dysfunction cataract surgery yet completely clear cause anterior blepharitis cataract surgery even understood far able determine report detailing clinical pathogenesis anterior blepharitis cataract surgery however several cause anterior blepharitis cataract surgery postulated first patient prohibited washing face certain period cataract surgery case third postoperative day patient may susceptible developing anterior blepharitis neglecting eyelid cleansing fact case patient tend refrain washing face lid hygiene 3-day no-wash period afraid wash face surgery resulting development blepharitis indeed previous report indicates significant efficacy lid hygiene perioperative period cataract surgery however although patient undergone cataract surgery bilaterally majority blepharitis one eye difference finding blepharitis right left eye therefore hypothesis inadequate eyelid cleansing cataract surgery lead development blepharitis still seems uncertain second institution recommends patient use topical antibiotic topical corticosteroid topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug month postoperatively discontinuation eye drop may associated development anterior blepharitis elucidated anterior blepharitis develops mainly month surgery third possibility ruled perioperative topical antibiotic disinfection may affected commensal bacteria present eyelid resulting development anterior blepharitis regarding patient subjective symptom interesting patient complained irritation including foreign body sensation noted case anterior blepharitis cataract surgery complain irritation fact patient blepharitis report irritation often overlooked clinical practice furthermore since retrospective study investigated medical record whether complaint symptom listed aao preferred practice pattern disappeared abated remained unchanged worsened research method one used previous report subjective symptom blepharitis general however blepharitis study use dry eye- mgd-related subjective symptom score method assessing subjective symptom may reflect true symptom anterior blepharitis desirable establish clinical score specific evaluation blepharitis symptom effect topical azithromycin anterior blepharitis occurred cataract surgery seems satisfactory regarding subjective symptom complete relief symptom noted patient 60.0 symptom reduction patient 26.7 thus nearly patient somehow effective blepharitis symptom likewise clinical finding significantly diminished topical azithromycin indicating topical azithromycin leading treatment option anterior blepharitis cataract surgery noted however although treatment efficacy excellent recurrence observed study patient required re-treatment anterior blepharitis although aao preferred practice pattern clearly state blepharitis permanently cured certain adjunctive treatment lid hygiene warm compress considered cataract surgery certain limitation study example since established diagnostic criterion blepharitis focused eyelid eyelash deposit defined anterior blepharitis case collarette greasy deposit diagnosis made clinically without bacteriological examination debatable whether case entered suspicion staphylococcal blepharitis truly blepharitis however many case clinical presentation closely resembles anterior blepharitis even absence negative bacterial culture since case post cataract surgery thus antibiotic eye drop used reduction bacterial detection therefore focus positive bacterial culture anterior blepharitis may underestimate epidemiology blepharitis cataract surgery indeed aao preferred practice pattern describes diagnosis blepharitis based typical patient history characteristic slit-lamp biomicroscopic finding whereas microbiologic culture positioned ancillary test second retrospective study able specify risk factor development blepharitis post-cataract surgery case additionally study lacked control group rule possibility reduction clinical finding observed
