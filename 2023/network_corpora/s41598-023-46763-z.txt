introduction following worldwide pandemic caused severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 virus great interest identifying risk protective factor resulting coronavirus disease covid-19 related health consequence improving understanding factor associated covid-19-related outcome much needed designing present future global national health prevention policy number systematic review meta-analyses strong evidence link individual characteristic e.g older age sex male heavy current smoking presence chronic disease obesity diabetes hypertension cardiovascular respiratory disease cancer increased risk sars-cov-2 infection morbidity severity related death currently evidence regarding protective role lifestyle factor including physical activity beyond established health-enhancing effect regular regarding non-communicable disease ncds associated risk factor protective role regular well documented infectivity severity respiratory infection systematic review meta‑analysis concluded regularly engaging moderate vigorous mvpa associated risk reduction community-acquired infectious disease risk reduction infectious disease mortality therefore highly

understanding link risk infection sars-cov-2 able draw recommendation important explore detail domain type may potential protective effect result study bring new evidence showing various category pa—but all—may play role reduction sars-cov-2 risk infection note fact study first investigate association different intensity e.g vigorous moderate different domain e.g leisure household different type e.g indoor outdoor lockdown risk infection sars-cov-2 finding obtained intensity domain type provide different view relation pa. first major interest analysing intensity especially mvpa study showed vigorous beneficial number cardiometabolic health outcome independent moderate study clearly showed adult performed vigorous lower infection risk whereas association moderate reach statistical significance even association moderate found adjustment energy intake remained tangential importantly previous study account intensity cho investigated intensity infection risk sars-cov-2 using self-report author reported significant inverse association moderate vigorous methodological disparity study relating sample size adjustment confounding factor might explain discrepancy result previous study another possible explanation relies specific activity classified moderate intensity walking could hypothesized total walking find associated infection risk mitigates association moderate looking domain type found higher time spent leisure-time well household outdoor indoor associated decreased risk infection result unaltered additional adjustment lifestyle habit daily level
