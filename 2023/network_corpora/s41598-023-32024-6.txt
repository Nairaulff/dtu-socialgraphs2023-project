introduction high-energy trauma traffic injury falling height often lead skin soft tissue necrosis deformity infection complication due sparse soft tissue coverage ankle infection difficult problem eradicating infection repairing bone defect maximizing limb function challenge orthopaedic surgeon currently commonly used method including ilizarov technique masquelet technique vascularized fibula transplantation advantage limitation bone transport ilizarov technique induced membrane technique masquelet technique commonly used treatment bone defect recent year bone transport classic treatment relies stretch-stress principle stimulate tissue regeneration widely reported treatment bone defect induced membrane technique carried two stage first stage polymethyl methacrylate pmma spacer inserted defect formation induced membrane second stage graft implanted membrane repair bone defect recent year indication expanded initial traumatic bone defect open fracture nonunion extremity bone

challenge orthopaedic surgeon remedy avoid amputation ankle fusion widely used bone reconstruction distal tibial infection bone defect ankle infection talus infection necrosis purpose surgical treatment effectively control infection repair bone defect restore painless stable ankle joint support walking full weight bearing commonly used method include ilizarov technique vascular bone grafting technique advantage disadvantage present literature report mostly using ilizarov ring external fixator hybrid hybrid external fixator joint fusion infection distraction-stress principle aim repair bone defect maintain length lower limb adjust alignment hind foot play irreplaceable role repair bone defect large volume pin site complication make unbearable many patient thus limiting application induced membrane technique relatively new technique antibiotic cement implanted first stage beneficial eradication infection also promote formation induced membrane around promotes repair bone defect indication expanded initial traumatic bone defect open fracture nonunion bone infection congenital tibial pseudojoints tumour however report treatment ankle infection retrograde intramedullary nail combined induced membrane technique study patient infected bone defect ankle treated induced membrane technique cavity filled antibiotic bone cement debridement antibiotic-loaded bone cement used wrap locking plate retrograde intramedullary nail combined bone grafting membrane used infection controlled evaluated clinical effect functional recovery last follow-up patient healed without infection effect good observed stability ankle good patient significantly reduced pain satisfied recovery ankle joint function aofas ankle-hind foot score significantly improved compared preoperative score gessmann reported case ankle infection treated ilizarov ring external fixator bone union rate 94.6 recurrence rate infection 5.4 aofas functional score averaged 67.9 point study bone union rate last follow-up 86.6 close previous report recurrence rate infection 13.3 higher previous literature local stabilization play important role infection control thorough debridement common stabilization method include ilizarov hybrid external fixators plate screw intramedullary nail external fixator placed infected area wire half-pins inserted outside infection focus avoid biofilm infection furthermore bone transport technique used repair bone defect always regarded standard treatment external fixators complication pin-track infection partial weight bearing long period inability many patient tolerate procedure plate require excessive stripping soft tissue especially ankle lack muscle coverage easily cause soft tissue irritation leading delayed wound healing dehiscence infection addition plate barrier effect graft may result absorption graft central fixation retrograde intramedullary nail strong axial anti-rotation stability provide immediate stability allows patient walk ground early save bone mass result showed low complication rate may due following reason first preserve fibula much possible maintain length limb debridement patient walk partial weight bearing grafting beneficial prevent osteoporosis surrounding soft tissue contracture addition fibula stripped used bone graft source greatly reduces trauma preserve soft tissue blood supply save operation time shortcoming present study small sample size short follow-up time lack control group however experience treatment ankle infection retrograde intramedullary nail combined induced membrane technique provide useful information future multicentre prospective study needed clarify effectiveness scientific nature treatment conclusion induced membrane technique combined posterior intramedullary nail effective method treat infected bone defect ankle significantly improve hindfoot function early weight bearing quality life attention required reduce rate infection recurrence
