introduction emergence spread sars-cov-2 virus majority testing virus aimed diagnosing covid-19 disease cause patient presenting symptom characteristic covid-19 however soon recognized infected person could develop covid-19 disease symptom 3–8 day post infection individual would never develop symptom asymptomatic despite lack symptom asymptomatic individual infectious carrying viral load high enough spread virus uninfected individual thus became clear control spread sars-cov-2 infection two-pronged approach used general population prevent virus spread infected asymptomatic individual non-infected population first prong involved utilisation physical barrier e.g face mask minimize virus spread via aerosol second prong involved routine weekly testing sars-cov-2 asymptomatic capturing infected non-infected individual high-risk infection testing considered critical situation large number individual co-congregate school prison aged care facility industrial workplace testing strategy
