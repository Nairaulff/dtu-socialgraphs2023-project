introduction stress diverse impact individual affecting physically mentally either acute chronic effect although individual may overcome stress effectively quickly others stress prolonged significant impact leading symptom re-experiencing hyperarousal ultimately individual may diagnosed stress-related disorder study suggest exposure stress result irreversible damage change brain even cause degenerative change degenerative change brain could lead onset dementia previous study demonstrated post-traumatic stress disorder ptsd considered severe form stress-related disorder associated increased risk developing dementia later life patient ptsd twice risk developing dementia 2.31 compared patient without ptsd among veteran however previous study primarily focused relationship ptsd dementia thereby limiting evidence regarding association dementia stress-related disorder may milder form shorter duration ptsd acute stress disorder milder form like adjustment disorder also associated dementia would suggest appropriate treatment necessary even case avoid potential link future dementia risk furthermore previous study generally focused military veteran might substantially differ general population term type stress face also study conducted non-veteran population believe need confirm whether association stress-related disorder dementia exists large sample general population lifetime prevalence ptsd korea 1.5 annual incidence acute stress disorder ptsd increased furthermore rapid aging prevalence dementia quickly risen 5.9 7.3 therefore believe research

association stress-related disorder different type dementia full size table discussion study aimed investigate association stress-related disorder risk dementia whether association differs among stress-related disorder dementia type south korean nationwide sample cohort 12-year follow-up period found history stress-related disorder associated increased risk dementia furthermore ptsd stress-related disorder type significantly associated history dementia whereas alzheimer disease dementia type highest risk increase patient stress-related disorder study result generally agreed previous study association stress-related disorder risk dementia previous study mainly focused development dementia patient ptsd showed veteran ptsd approximately two-fold higher risk development dementia follow-up period similar result 1.95 finding similar previous study participant general population showed association ptsd dementia risk one meta-analysis suggested risk dementia general population higher veteran study focused full range stress-related disorder result suggested association stress-related disorder dementia similar result study study indicated ptsd also type stress-related disorder associated development dementia among type stress-related disorder ptsd associated highest risk dementia result showed severe long-lasting type stress-related disorder strongest association risk dementia suggesting stronger stress may increase risk dementia adjustment disorder also showed significantly elevated risk dementia indicating ptsd sole contributor increased dementia risk observed stress-related disorder primary distinction ptsd adjustment disorder stress trauma intensity consequent reaction although stressor leading ptsd often sudden life-threatening causing adjustment disorder typically severe life-threatening result symptom manifest differently seen ptsd therefore stressor capable causing adjustment disorder associated onset dementia caution warranted even patient disorder however dementia risk ptsd higher adjustment disorder presumed result intense stressor previous study shown risk dementia increase higher perceived stress likely support hypothesis however study used diagnostic code data instead actually assessing stressor thus pinpointing exact reason remains challenging research needed subgroup analysis decreased inversely age notably almost increase risk observed individual aged year could increased age significant risk factor dementia thereby relatively diminishing risk elevation attributable stress-related disorder table risk dementia participant aged year 31.55 time higher compared previous study also considered higher age significant risk factor dementia suggests young people experience stress-related disorder could higher risk developing dementia later life highlighting need long-term follow-up management conducting subgroup analysis based social security income disability result showed tendency decrease group lower possible reason could similar age lower may significant risk factor dementia table study lower associated higher risk dementia support similar previous finding furthermore patient lower may likely seek medical care stress-related disorder analysis based healthcare claim data individual visited psychiatric clinic rather direct assessment potential underestimation owing people visit hospital previous research analyzing hospital visit ptsd based national income level found people high-income country twice likely seek treatment compared low-income country suggesting low might associated low visiting rate clinic due ptsd mechanism underlying association stress-related disorder development dementia remain unclear one hypothesis based previous evidence association stress-related disorder cardiovascular disease suggesting dementia may develop via vascular impairment study risk vascular dementia among patient stress-related disorder increased significantly may small sample size short follow-up period another hypothesis state certain neurobiological pathway induced stress alter hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis may affect hippocampus impact may reduce hippocampal volume induce oxidative damage hippocampus turn accelerates process hippocampus degeneration hippocampal atrophy characteristic alzheimer disease risk development highest patient stress-related disorder another hypothesis low resilience may act common underlying factor linking stress-related disorder dementia resilience ability adapt successfully faced significant adversity individual low resilience higher risk developing stress-related disorder including ptsd individual high resilience lower risk clinical dementia experience onset later stage thus low resilience stress might common risk factor stress-related disorder dementia investigation mechanism conducted prevent dementia development among patient stress-related disorder study several limitation first retrospective cohort study could include variable might affect development dementia family history health behavior including smoking drinking laboratory data included analysis second number patient diagnosed stress-related disorder may underestimated analysis number actual stress-related disorder patient might higher number included analysis people hesitate visit psychiatric clinic south korea third claim data provided diagnostic code claim thus accuracy might limited suggested previous study enhance accuracy diagnosis included primary secondary diagnostic code visit analysis fourth could evaluate severity stress-related disorder dementia symptom defined patient claimed icd-10 code could use scale disorder could assume severity symptom fifth study reflect patient mixed diagnosis whose diagnosis changed time unable directly ass symptom patient relied health insurance claim data possibility change recorded minimize instability diagnosis opted use diagnosis given patient first visit likely relatively stable reflect initial symptom severity patient finally owing retrospective nature study causal relationship could established increased risk dementia may result temporal relationship rather causal relationship despite limitation study several strength although data used several limitation due characteristic claim data data represents general population south korea sample cohort entire population therefore result study generalized entire korean population country similar population structure may provide background management dementia occurrence among patient stress-related disorder also applied propensity score matching exposure variable thus confounding factor patient without stress-related disorder reduced comparability enhanced conclusion study identified association history stress-related disorder risk dementia south korean national representative cohort individual diagnosed stress-related disorder 1.15-times higher risk dementia furthermore among type stress-related disorder ptsd associated highest risk dementia development adjustment disorder also increased risk dementia alzheimer disease dementia type highest risk increase among individual stress-related disorder research using prospective design clarify causality mechanism relationship stress-related disorder dementia controlled environment conducted validate finding
