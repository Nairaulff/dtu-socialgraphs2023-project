antibiotic activity mucin-rich environment interestingly unlike vancomycin net positive charge physiological condition teicoplanin bsm molecule negatively charged hydrophobic force might employed rather electrostatic force acyl tail term complexation partial interaction aggregation teicoplanin bsm three consequence follows– since teicoplanin hydrophobic tail allocate near lipid precursor monomer multimeric formation mucin inevitably reduces antimicrobial activity also since aggregate likely removed transferred nasolacrimal duct blinking total concentration teicoplanin decrease ocular
