introduction radiography widely used imaging technique evaluation canine thorax obtaining high-quality image essential correct radiographic interpretation overlooking proper technique lead misinterpretation several radiographic sign topic radiographic image quality scarcely investigated veterinary medicine paper available subject additionally incidence cause radiographic technical error veterinary clinical practice poorly understood human medicine specific guideline outlining acceptable diagnostic image quality standard available however best author knowledge guideline exist veterinary medicine use artificial intelligence veterinary diagnostic imaging experiencing rapid increase popularity veterinarian become aware benefit offered technology led corresponding rise number published work exploring various application field veterinary medicine particularly last year study application classifying canine meningioma distinguishing meningioma glioma detecting spinal cord disease image published date prolific sector investigation field application automatic detection lesion thoracic x-ray increasing number publication topic recent year seen growing interest use automatic evaluation quality medical image human medicine several ai-based algorithm developed quality evaluation chest x-ray image promising result however best author knowledge tool yet unavailable
