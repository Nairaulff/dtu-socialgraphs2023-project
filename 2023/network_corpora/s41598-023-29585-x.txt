roseburia eubacterium utilize acetate produce butyrate part complex cross-feeding chain therefore presume decreased total scfas production observed cfbm due absence added carbohydrate source could used cultivation process highly metabolically active community interaction host metabolism often mediated bacterial metabolite nutritional component cultivation medium key determinant metabolic performance vitro cultivation nonetheless still lack systematic study medium composition impact metabolome cultured vitro study lc-hr-ms/ms approach used analyze impact cultivation medium metabolome profile ms-based untargeted metabolomics considered sensitive nmr-based method commonly lead generation vast number unidentified metabolic feature nevertheless nmr ms-based method considered complementary recommended use combination obtain detailed information shift metabolic profile metabolic pathway network interaction response medium supplementation vitro culture condition result showed studied medium unique impact metabolite profile vitro culture almost detected metabolite unidentified result make difficult conclude component tested medium stimulate production specific metabolite maintenance microbiota functional activity using kegg analysis increase bile secretion biosynthesis unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid metabolism biosynthesis secondary metabolite metabolic pathway noticed example many study associated bile acid metabolism composition total number correlation metabolite metabolite pathway faeces nonetheless metabolome analysis showed cultivation gmm medium led increased production considerable number metabolite lowered medium group metabolite assigned kegg pathway connected various form metabolism reported despite high inter-individual variability functional pathway stable within healthy human population instance visconti reported metabolic pathway detected human faecal sample contrast specie detected sample turn aguirre showed similar trend metabolic activity term scfa production using inoculum prepared individual donor pool furthermore stool metabolome reflects gm-host interaction greatly impact host biological function health status together result demonstrate application untargeted metabolomics vitro cultivation study could powerful tool discovery identification metabolite biomarkers correlated human disease summary although vitro culture limitation provides non-invasive model study outcome different factor shaping community metabolic activity diet xenobiotics drug therefore indirectly impact host health well-being conclusion similar previously published report result also shown suitability using pooled faecal inoculum vitro batch culture moreover presented varying effect different cultivation medium global human community composition metabolic activity study observed use low-carbohydrate medium cfbm led significant decrease biodiversity scfas production commercial schaedler broth supplemented sheep blood preserved high biodiversity metabolic activity human moreover significant enrichment biodegradation pathway xenobiotics observed medium indicates usefulness future study impact exogenous xenobiotics human intestinal microbiota result indicate limitation study inability cultivate whole population tested medium however considerable proportion bacterial community within preserved single-growth medium appropriate supplementation medium essential growth fastidious taxon noted interpretation result obtained study restricted small number sample well utilizing rdna amplicon sequencing approach nonetheless believed result provide useful insight improve vitro cultivation process
