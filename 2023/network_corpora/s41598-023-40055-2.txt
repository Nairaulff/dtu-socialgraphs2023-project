introduction acute myocardial infarction ami second leading cause death taiwan death toll due ami reached 21,852 average death toll 45.6 per 100,000 people united state approximately 550,000 patient newly diagnosed myocardial infarction year approximately 200,000 patient experience recurrence study recommended patient elevation myocardial infarction stemi treated percutaneous coronary intervention pci within min arriving emergency department hospital perform 24-h pci hospital revisit occurs shortly emergency department visit usually defined visit made within day referred early return visit early return rate regarded key indicator quality emergency care study reported patient made early return visit higher mortality rate higher risk involved medical dispute taiwanese study indicated rate emergency department revisits within day discharge approximately 5.47 major reason revisits disease-related factor 80.9 followed patient-related factor 10.9 doctor-related factor 8.2 therefore rate hospital revisits within day discharge key indicator quality emergency care also affect patient prognosis subsequent medical cost according u.s. statistic pertaining period rate hospital readmission within day discharge among patient stemi 12.3 another large-scale nationwide u.s. study revealed 10.3 patient stemi multiple coronary artery unblocked hospitalized within day

full size table discussion relevant variable controlled risk death among patient stemi sent hospital 24-h pci service significnately lower among patient stemi sent hostpials without 24-h pci service reason may hospital provided 24-h pci service taiwan medical center regional hospital also discovered hospital level risk death among patient sent district hospital significantly higher among patient sent medical center furthermore patient sent hospital 24-h pci service prone undergoing delayed pci treatment referral study revealed risk death among patient ami significantly correlated time onset ami unblocking vessel pci i.e. ischemic time time arrival emergency room unblocking vessel pci d2b d2w discovered risk death within day emergency visit significantly lower among patient stemi sent medical center among sent type hospital reason may relative type hospital medical center typically exhibited greater compliance clinical guideline patient stemi literature finding indicate hospital exhibit greater compliance clinical guideline contribute significantly lower risk death among patient also discovered patient underwent pci significantly lower risk death relative undergo pci taiwan patient stemi undergo pci either referred hospital treated fibrinolytic therapy patient suitable pci highly critical condition occlusion three coronary artery study reported risk death among patient ami underwent pci directly lower among patient underwent fibrinolytic therapy addition patient referred another hospital undergo pci first hospital admitted pci treatment delayed affect prognosis three aforementioned condition likely significantly reduce risk death among patient undergo pci however 24-h pci service model could reduce risk emergency department revisit within day discharge risk readmission within day discharge implementation national health insurance program accessibility medical care became high taiwan patient stemi likely undergo full treatment discharged stable condition treated conventional procedure demonstrated low rate emergency department revisits within day discharge 1.13 low rate readmission within day discharge 1.19 table accordingly recommend reasonable expansion 24-h pci service model result indicate 24-h pci service model significantly reduced risk death within day emergency visit among patient stemi thus government establish 24-h pci service model administrative district reduce risk death among patient stemi several strength present study taiwan national health insurance program provides insurance coverage approximately 99.9 citizen therefore data national health insurance research database provided sufficient representation taiwan population national full-population multiyear data applied present study hence statistic reliable addition factor affect prognosis patient stemi e.g. risk death risk revisiting emergency department within day discharge risk readmission within day discharge comprehensively explored present study present study also several limitation performed retrospective analysis using secondary data obtained national health insurance research database data constraint database could study health behavior timing cardiac catheterization procedure admission time participant limitation present study although taiwan national health insurance coverage extensive economic consideration may still primary factor healthcare treatment despite medical guideline recommendation still true every patient pci received drug-eluting stent implantation taiwan nhi partially covered cost drug-eluting stent future research also suggest analyzing impact factor cabg drug-eluting stent medication acei/arb antiplatelet agent beta-blockers conclusion relevant variable controlled risk death within day emergency department visit among patient stemi sent hospital 24-h pci service significantly lower among patient stemi sent hospital without 24-h pci service 0.85 0.75–0.98 therefore establishment 24-h pci service model significantly reduced risk death within day emergency department visit among patient stemi however model could reduce risk emergency department revisits within day discharge risk readmission within
