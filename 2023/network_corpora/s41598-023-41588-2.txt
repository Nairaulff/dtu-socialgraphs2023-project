introduction prevalence type diabetes mellitus t2dm sharply increased past four decade diabetes complication seriously affect patient health also bring huge economic burden patient family society china medical expenditure related diabetes reached billion ranking second world prevent control diabetes numerous study conducted confirmed lifestyle factor could influence patient health outcome furthermore several study conducted china finland america found lifestyle intervention including diet exercise postpone onset t2dm reduce incidence diabetes complication ultimately increase life expectancy people t2dm apply existing extensive evidence manage diabetes primary care international diabetes federation idf emphasized cornerstone t2dm management improve diabetes self-management dsm ability including diet medication adherence physical activity healthy body weight produced series guideline diabetes management prevention care china largest number people diabetes thus may face considerable challenge chronic complication future government already paid much attention managing diabetes enacted policy equalization basic public health service rural china people t2dm targeted key population chronic disease management specific measure include regular quarterly follow-up free fasting blood glucose fbg test annual comprehensive health examination health education different medical prescription people t2dm although policy implemented almost year challenge related diabetes prevention control remains large serious recent study estimated 49.2 treated patient achieved successful glycemic control china hba1c level 7.0 another study showed patient dsm behavior score lower-middle level suburban hospital beijing similarly study conducted shandong province found compared patient urban area patient rural area poorer dsm behavior patient rural china facing greater difficulty challenge urban area lower education level unbalanced distribution high-quality medical resource therefore improving dsm people t2dm educational intervention rural china top priority future hba1c reflects average plasma glucose month preceding test considered biomarker presence severity hyperglycemia implying diabetes pre-diabetes also considered risk factor marker diabetes-related complication process diabetes treatment management serval study indicated high hba1c variability associated cardiovascular complication t2dm also associated increased risk all-cause cardiovascular mortality therefore hba1c used biochemical marker glucose regulation people t2dm also outcome variable diabetes prevention intervention program similarly hba1c also important outcome variable future intervention study aiming reflect glycemic management patient diabetes intervention relationship diabetes knowledge hba1c level cleared although study investigating effect policy indicated change diabetes knowledge medication compliance dsm hba1c level little attention given exploring association diabetes knowledge hba1c level patient rural china besides study used cross-sectional data causal inference therefore analytical cross-sectional study aimed investigate whether

chance controlling glycemia successfully discussion study investigated correlation diabetes knowledge hba1c level people t2dm based tracking data rural china found diabetes knowledge could predict hba1c level adjusting sociodemographic clinical behavioral variable furthermore multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed result consistent result study also conducted jiangsu province found improving diabetes knowledge help lower fbg level one-year educational intervention result study may suggest improving diabetes knowledge lead decrease hba1c level correlation explained knowledge attitude practice kap applied health education practice since 1960s people t2dm receiving ongoing diabetes health education improve understanding diabetes help establish active attitude toward treatment patient active attitude may enable change dsm behavior influence hba1c level however coefficient diabetes knowledge may high multiple linear regression model reviewing previous study study estimated every time patient answered one question hba1c level decreased 0.239 another study found participant hba1c associated poor diabetes knowledge additionally systematic review concluded continuous regular education could result mean reduction 2.02 hba1c among chinese patient contrast study conducted urban area china found significant difference knowledge score people hba1c hba1c another study revealed two-year educational intervention significant difference fbg level treatment control group finding inconsistent suggested relationship diabetes knowledge glycemic control worthy study two reason coefficient diabetes knowledge high one hand previous study still large gap knowledge behavior related glycemic control attitude undiscovered factor may play essential role process hand several sociodemographic variable also influenced hba1c level significantly model first female patient hba1c level lower male female patient likely successfully control glycemia consistent result obtained study study found sex difference glycemic control study concluded female likely achieve target hba1c although female better self-care high level adherence depression common female male made difficult woman successfully control glycemia study mostly conducted urban area however setting study rural area many difference urban rural area economic cultural factor may influence sex difference glycemic control rural china female need farm work housework male mainly busy farm work rarely housework thus total amount exercise female may higher male increase possibility female achieving success glycemic control second older patient may lower hba1c level since older patient time focus health younger patient busy dealing work family third patient farming lower hba1c level patient job farmer perform physical activity job addition compared people whose monthly income 5,000 yuan people whose monthly income 5,000–10,000 yuan lower hba1c level patient capable paying medical bill similarly sex employment status diabetes knowledge significantly influenced hba1c level logistic regression model furthermore married respondent higher risk unsuccessful glycemic control single respondent seems probable couple conflict dsm behavior one worsen therefore seemed single patient likely achieve target hba1c notably reported table people t2dm poor diabetes knowledge rural china low education level even illiterate addition patient mean age older year old related poor diabetes knowledge reported qualitative study recent research reported patient low level diabetes knowledge objective phenomenon rural china finding line study thailand found people t2dm also poor diabetes knowledge based fact poor diabetes knowledge improving diabetes knowledge level may enable patient realize severity t2dm promote behavior change addition found medication adherence dsm factor influence hba1c level significantly either multiple linear regression logistic regression model reported table participant poor medication adherence low level dsm due lack diabetes knowledge noted smbg associated hba1c level supplementary table study inconsistent meta-analysis research actually relationship smbg hba1c level remains unclear recent randomized trial found clinically statistically significant difference year glycemic control patient performed smbg compared perform smbg theoretically important patient behavior change based result smbg could influence glycemic control rather smbg therefore relationship two variable potential mechanism explored future several limitation current study first 64.17 participant returned second measurement hba1c although men declined second visit table significant difference found follow-up men loss follow-up men term diabetes knowledge neither woman supplementary

desirability bias recall bias may still exist objective measurement dsm used future third one district selected study future work extended site universality difference relationship diabetes knowledge hba1c level tested concurrently study significant strength first tracking data used explore correlation independent variable dependent variable made causality plausible second hba1c used ass patient average blood glucose concentration preceding 2–3 month stable others third people t2dm rural area chosen study population urgent need improving dsm behavior rarely concerned practical significance conclusion study provided longitudinal evidence effect diabetes knowledge hba1c level patient low education level indicated intervention focusing diabetes knowledge need strengthened rural china acquisition knowledge played several decade community chronic disease management finding presented important evidence knowledge acquisition may important role may implication policy chronic disease management low- middle-income country improving diabetes knowledge need strengthened patient low education level rural china help improve outcome reduce disease burden
