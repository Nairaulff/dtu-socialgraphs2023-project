introduction urban development modifies biotic abiotic characteristic ecosystem concern biodiversity conservation global scale urbanization associated impoverishment natural habitat fragmentation destruction consequently several plant animal specie disappear urban area progressively reducing urban biodiversity non-optimal habitat quality characterizes urban area alternative food source garbage human-related food feeder etc also disturbance noise light pollution increase inter- intraspecific competition among individual anthropic hazard urban site may affect bird several way see review díaz overall specie limited niche breadth could associated higher extinction risk wider niche breadth thus constant replacement native specie alien generalist specie community process biotic homogenization characterizes anthropic landscape biotic homogenization increases—over time—community genetic taxonomic functional similarity decrease distinct functional trait replaced trait shared many specie consequently urban community e.g. avian specie assemblage often characterized reduced functional diversity predominancy generalist specie considering habitat selection nest site selection diet
