potential benefit ofa study aligns previous research bariatric surgery meta-analysis showing significant difference total postoperative opioid consumption similar result study mulier reduction nrs

bilateral subcostal transversus abdominis plane block essential factor may impact result reduced total opioid requirement associated improved pain score also seen recent study ahmed soudi latter trial

limitation study include choice remifentanil mma group may increase pain intensity first selection adhered recommendation erabs guideline use drug short half-life possible bariatric anesthesia another limitation discontinuation coanalgesic infusion ofa group end surgery benefit patient could clinically relevant maintenance infusion however safety validity treatment require study conclusion mode anesthesia influence pain score opioid administration operation moreover advantage lessening incidence severity ponv reducing opioid use evident limited period following surgery form anesthesia allowed patient discharge within day procedure patient received ofa required intervention maintain hemodynamic stability indicating need research ass safety efficacy
