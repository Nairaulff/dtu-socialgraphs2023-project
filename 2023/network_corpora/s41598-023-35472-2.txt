introduction zamiifolia zamioculcas zamiifolia commonly named aroid palm aroid plant emerald palm eternity plant zanzibar gem zuzu plant plant one important houseplant araceae family relatively narrow glossy green black leaf plant thick horizontal rhizome grow low light condition highly tolerant drought stress disease pest nowadays plant tissue culture technique significantly increased efficiency breeding method including breeding using mutagenesis use mutation induction method e.g mean gamma ray ornamental plant promising main trait annual ornamental plant obtained mutation induction flower color flower increase flower shape leaf shape number flower petal leaf size plant size plant smallness large flower form plant growth habit growth rate number branch flower longevity specie genus
