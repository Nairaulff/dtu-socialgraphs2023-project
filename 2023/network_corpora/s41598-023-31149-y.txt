scanty literature result shown along south-eastern africa corridor genotype predominant consistent finding meta-analysis global distribution hbv genotype similarly genotype prevalent western northern

migration exploited explain hbv genotype distribution pattern africa first evidence historical migration pastoral community east africa south africa based y-chromosome genetic study archeological data

ancestral bantu immigrant east africa moreover genotype long history bantu speaker southern-africa allied progression hcc among chronically infected hbv person belonging bantu ethnic group secondly high prevalence genotype north africa could accounted dominance mediterranean region well europe hence historical immigration million french italian north africa transoceanic immigration could imported genotype north africa moreover dominant genotype europe could imported europe colonial time north africa european could imported north africa furthermore immigrant arabian peninsula north africa could introduced hbv/d region evidenced chromosome haplotype population arabian peninsula north africa thirdly although genotype reported dominant west africa highlighted literature study

western-central africa around niger benue river across central africa southern-eastern africa fourthly increased trans-continental migration partly explains progressive increasing formerly endemic

deadly genotype among hbv genotype due association high hbv dna level prolonged hbeag seropositivity basal core promoter mutation correlate high risk hcc furthermore infection hbv/b reported
