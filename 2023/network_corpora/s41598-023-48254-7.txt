introduction population ecosystem around world threatened range escalating stressor climate change including temperature warming extreme weather event imperative increase understanding recovery disturbance coral reef illustrative example ecosystem threat coral recruitment integral facet reef recovery impacted factor including available substrate micro-habitats/surface irregularity competition algae predation benthic feeding fish corallivores herbivore i.e. family labridae scaridae pomacentridae chaetodontidae acanthuridae fish consume macroalgae compete coral directly incidentally consume coral recruit provide clean substrate bite scar however fish population also changing globally due fishing pressure habitat alteration disturbance increased knowledge needed understand role fish shaping coral recruitment improve prediction future consequence management continued pressure tropical coastal ecosystem benthic feeding fish influence coral recruitment survival direct indirect pathway herbivorous fish indirectly promote coral recruitment consuming competitive macroalgae turn creates space palatable crustose coralline algae cca increase coral recruitment survival however herbivore corallivores negatively affect coral recruitment direct accidental predation herbivorous fish usually grouped within four functional group based feeding strategy- scraper excavator grazers browser parrotfish unique group herbivorous fish beak-like jaw bite scrape excavate surface benthos indirectly affect coral recruitment physically modifying substrate bite mark size bite scar varies fish body size example large parrotfish specie like bolbometopon muricatum would leave larger scar smaller specie like chlorurus microrhinos unique feeding mode remove benthic organism leave clear scar substratum thus potentially influencing successional process reef opening new settlement space restarting successional clock may create recruitment window coral recruit bite

negative effect benthic feeding fish coral recruitment directly grazing indirectly bite mark varies time divot mimicking grazing scar parrotfish primary driver coral recruitment pattern enhanced coral recruitment early succession suggesting scar may act important microhabitats recruiting coral effect attenuated year initially grazing benthic feeding fish promoted coral recruitment year trend reversed coral found caged tile rather uncaged tile result suggest initially large fish may promote coral recruitment year direct predation fish may surpass positive effect decreased competition negatively impact coral recruit similarly effect caging decreased time significant year tile deployment thus result suggest fish structure short term pattern coral recruitment grazing scar direct grazing long term top control diminishes factor like temperature stress symbiodinium community successional taxon may become important driver successional time grazing scar parrotfish promote coral recruitment early succession divot mimicking grazing scar parrotfish promoted coral recruitment year new substrate available potentially provided refuge accidental direct predation similarly microhabitats previously found promote coral recruitment settlement tile however contrary result doropoulos found microhabitats interacted presence fish found highest coral recruitment crevice uncaged treatment potentially fish excluded coral face competition algae may also use microhabitats refuge however find statistical significance caging treatment interacting divot potentially divot shallower e.g 0.3 0.4 vs. wider 1.8 3.6 vs. 1.2 doropoulos al. crevice may create highly competitive environment algae e.g increased water flow get rid algae exudate like microbe nutrient thus reinforcing idea size dimension may influence role microhabitats driving coral recruitment pattern result emphasize parrotfish play important role maintaining algal community bioerosion also create microhabitats grazing scar thus promoting coral recruitment impact fish grazing coral recruitment varies time initially excluding herbivore resulted lower coral recruitment year relationship reversed excluding herbivore promoted coral recruit abundance suggests fish exposure initially promotes coral recruitment time direct incidental predation may impact coral survival thus emphasizing important tradeoff ontogeny result suggests competition macroalgae may strong driver early successional stage whereas corallivory may become dominant driver later successional stage algae lobophora declined abundance caged tile time providing support hypothesis coral-algae competition stronger year year furthermore community composition became similar uncaged caged tile time increase lobophora decline cca uncaged tile suggesting competition and/or facilitation would likely show larger difference caging treatment year year exposure fish previously found positive negative impact coral recruitment caging protect juvenile coral predation increase survival excluding fish also increase amount macroalgae decrease coral facilitator cca mixed positive negative result study previous literature suggests role fish likely varies coral ontogeny emphasized doropoulos environment pre-existing fish community reef degradation example palmyra highly remote protected region high fish abundance grazing pressure may greater negative impact coral recruit disturbed region like hawaii caribbean palau depend fish control algal growth especially environmental context expansion algae accelerated anthropogenic nutrient pollution additionally previous research demonstrated herbivore control coral recruitment varies herbivore composition leary found fish grazing promoted coral recruitment marine protected area dominated herbivorous fish whereas fished reef high abundance sea urchin sea urchin grazing reduced coral recruit survival previous study palmyra found fish exclosures promoted coral recruitment one month opposite week result potentially due benthic feeding fish causing significant coral mortality one month therefore survey timing may integral measuring coral recruitment tradeoff difference even week however agreement result also found role fish structuring coral recruitment decreased time four month difference methodology may contribute difference result example tile divot flat surface whereas tile flat surface additionally important note differentiate survival new settlement year year initially week tile deployment high coral recruitment uncaged tile grazing scar however potentially translate high coral survival time example coral exposed fish may experienced high mortality predation led significant difference coral recruitment caged uncaged year additionally coral initially recruited divot may experienced mortality competition sessile organism like algae finally recruitment level could low year post-settlement mortality may unable capture statistical difference recruitment caging treatment tile position role fish decreased time driving coral recruitment pattern year herbivore exposure grazing scar longer drove pattern coral recruitment suggesting factor like environmental condition e.g temperature stress symbiodinium community successional taxon may become important driving coral success survival time example caged tile lobophora cca uncaged tile lobophora negatively impact coral recruitment releasing algae exudate thus rest successional community may play important role later succession override initial short-term benefit grazing scar protection predation additionally year rest successional community may filled divot growth e.g paved cca turf etc caused grazing scar become similar microhabitats reef previous research found similar short-term effect fish grazing coral recruitment effect becoming insignificant day four month result supported experimental work protist community found top-down control predator influenced prey community composition early succession later stage succession result emphasize recent call community ecology directly integrate temporal dynamic specie interaction vary ontogeny seasonality climate change vertical microhabitats promote coral recruitment coral recruit consistently highest abundance edge tile year one three thus vertical orientation may act type microhabitat similar grazing scar promotes coral recruitment previous research demonstrated vertical surface promote juvenile coral abundance survival potentially reducing sedimentation and/or direct sunlight compared horizontal surface additionally research coral reef algae community found vertical surface affected grazing typically dominated crustose coralline algae cca thus high coral recruit abundance observed edge tile may driven lower predation increased settlement cue cca coral reef worldwide risk losing structural complexity loss live coral cover shift functional composition potentially could cascading consequence coral recruitment could vertical substrate microhabitats coral settlement future research limitation result suggest role benthic feeding fish influencing coral recruitment recovery following disturbance likely vary time may apparent early succession example immediately disturbance like extreme heat wave climate change coral reef may face recurring disturbance impact losing fish may become important coral reef may continually locked early succession furthermore small patch reef regularly early successional stage example coral dying breaking wave action addition impact likely vary across reef different condition local pressure palmyra atoll remote protected system high fish biomass low algae cover compared degraded reef result suggest excluding large fish grazing may play important role structuring coral recruitment reef fish higher algae cover additionally palmyra atoll may higher coral recruitment disturbed reef lower overall coral cover thus reef lower recruitment fish may play stronger role therefore future research consider top-down control tradeoff vary across reef different degradation level fish community recruitment level benthic cover study limited fact monitor individual coral survival determine new recruitment time point addition although study one longest evaluating role fish determining pattern coral recruitment year year typical study especially remote near-pristine reef able monitor coral recruitment three time point due logistical limitation visiting remote atoll thus limited understanding fine scale temporal dynamic 2-week time point would robust taken tile back lab identify coral recruit microscope using methodology year year however unable use methodology due fieldwork logistics time constraint furthermore included site fixed effect instead random effect limit generalizability result however found limited evidence site significant driver coral recruitment pattern e.g. significant edge model additionally flat surface tile slightly larger divot surface area vs. higher probability recruit settle flat surface however result show exact opposite trend higher recruitment divot finally although previous research found cage mesh size system influence water flow light attenuation conclusion would robust included cage control finally use completely bare artificial tile may slightly different effect grazing scar created already crowded congested reef surface competitor close creation bare space grazing scar may play significant role opening bare space coral recruitment previous study found although coral recruited settlement tile new recruit visible natural surface suggesting reef recovery likely influenced available substrate competition organism pattern may influenced fact time decreasing available space new coral recruit increased competition organism space conclusion result suggest fish play important role determining short-term pattern coral recruitment time influence diminishes thus result suggest imperative manage coral reef fish population especially herbivorous fish like parrotfish eat competitive algae also create bare substrate microhabitats reef especially important coral reef likely increasingly locked early successional stage e.g. repeat bleaching event storms/wave action fish play important role structuring coral recruitment overall result demonstrate role consumer structuring
