introduction animal determine timing life-history transition fundamental question evolutionary ecology hatching emergence metamorphosis maturation occur point life transitioning right time according specie individual situation essential obtain high fitness thus specie expected evolved fine-tuned life-history strategy adjust timing optimally several theoretical mathematical experimental study focused aspect size time developmental milestone considered effective predictor future fitness amphibian metamorphosis best-suited field study phenomenon amphibian complex life cycle aquatic larval terrestrial adult stage many study tried explain amphibian determine timing metamorphosis researcher shown many case metamorphosis occur larger size larger size metamorphosis often lead greater fitness higher survival rate faster growth rate terrestrial stage however larva need time reach larger size must stay aquatic environment longer sometimes unfavorable larva exposed desiccation predation risk aquatic environment thus larva struggle solve tradeoff becoming early-small vs. late-large metamorphs well-known theory explain amphibian metamorphosis advocated wilbur collins minimum maximum body size metamorphosis occur larva determine size metamorphosis depending recent growth history example slowly growing larva metamorphose reach minimum size threshold postponing larval period lead higher aquatic mortality rate doe offset benefit larger conceptual model explains larva certain specie time life-history transition different environmental condition several study tried verify
