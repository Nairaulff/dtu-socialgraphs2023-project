flap periosteal flap good option case atrophic nonunion also thought first line treatment atrophic nonunion case large bone defect fibular flap could used however significant bone loss vascularized periosteal flap ideal alternative mfc periosteal flap present crucial advantage notably vascularity supporting bone healing applicability small bone defect promotion fracture healing enhanced blood

pedicled periosteal flap 3.5 month mean union time study month study aslantürk focused treating femoral nonunion using sandwich technique strut allograft achieving union patient within 6.2 month despite author utilizing strut allograft atrophic oligotrophic nonunions inherently boost blood flow satisfactory result complete bone union reported case one instance superficial infection however two patient study underwent multiple nonunion surgery distinguishing research addition utilization strut graft mentioned study incurred possible increase treatment cost notable drawback study comparison mentioned research flap dissection involves relatively challenging technique requires learning curve notwithstanding favorable outcome present study doe exclude limitation first study based retrospective design small sample size without comparison group since case uncommon gathering large number case series challenging however limitation mitigated long follow-up period longer previously published study conclusion pedicled mfc flap femur distal two-thirds effective treatment recalcitrant femur nonunions without significant bone defect dependence microvascular anastomosis besides operation time relatively short donor site morbidity minimal surgeon may consider flap useful reconstruction option patient previous failed femur nonunion treatment
