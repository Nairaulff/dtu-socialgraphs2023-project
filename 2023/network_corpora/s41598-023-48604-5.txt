health establish good exercise habit plyometric training commonly used method physical conditioning shown effectively improve jumping ability adolescent effectiveness due effective utilization mechanical neurophysiological model plyometric training mechanical model suggests muscle rapidly stretched elastic potential energy increased stored stretched muscle immediately shortened rapid concentric contraction stored elastic potential energy instantly released thereby increasing muscle force output neurophysiological model muscle utilizes principle stretch reflex enhance force
