patient nevertheless case cip recorded database nerve conduction study five-year period number reflects substantially fewer individual expected reviewing literature one reason nerve conduction study performed every patient clinical sign weakness including cip setting patient meet inclusion criterion aware fact study limitation one might argue case study sicker therefore likely develop cip control indicated longer duration stay ccus hand knowledge underlying pathophysiological mechanism development cip longer stay fully understood nutrition therefore also lipid status play pivotal role critically ill patient recent study real-world cohort demonstrated early enteral nutrition associated improved outcome critically ill patient emphasizing importance topic furthermore prospective study showed early alteration measurement critically ill patient early within day admission finding also associated higher mortality demonstrates rapid effect critical illness nerve cell early phase ccu treatment however clinical discrimination cip generalized weakness due underlying condition might challenging due study retrospective design rule patient included control developed cip hospital discharge minor form condition however believe latter minor issue thoroughly screened patient record evidence cip another important aspect pathogenesis cip likely multifactorial severe drop serum lipid level caused critical illness might lead breakdown nerve cell impair communication e.g. generalized inflammation capillary leak could possibly explain case longer stay ccu lower cholesterol level prone develop cip subsequently due lack data retrospective analysis safely rule potentially contributing factor e.g. fasting blood glucose vitamin although available level latter study population normal range result consistent prior study indicating hypocholesterinemia might result aggravated polyneuropathy trial conducted non-critically ill type diabetes patient nevertheless mechanism discussed might similar study population lipid composition schwann cell might altered cholesterol deficiency contrarily recent review animal study report cholesterol depletion synthesis inhibition may enhance axonal regeneration furthermore cholesterol synthesis reduced neural injury rat model remains unclear whether finding also applicable human finally duration critical illness significant risk factor cip summarize finding dataset multidisciplinary intensive care unit patient suggest low serum cholesterol level profound decrease cholesterol level associated critical illness development future prospective trial needed elaborate causal relationship entity
