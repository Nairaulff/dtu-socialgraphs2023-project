disease result revealed medication nonadherence case duration illness residence mother educational level independent factor affecting medication adherence yang examined patient tic disorder west china revealing 40.7 child exhibited good medication adherence decreasing quality life living non-rural area significant independent determinant non-adherence however prevalence medication adherence influencing factor reported previous study exhibit substantial variation sample size previous study china relatively small addition although previous meta-analysis revealed anxiety common parent young people chronic health condition study explored relationship guardian mental state child medication adherence therefore currently lack research medication adherence among child china necessary conduct cross-sectional study evaluate prevalence medication adherence ass association guardian mental health medication adherence outpatient western china identify characteristic associated nonadherence

evaluated medication adherence among child seen outpatient department west china analyzed factor influencing medication adherence used mmas-8 ass medication adherence included item could affect medication adherence past week main reason non-adherence follows patient guardian forgotten use medication patient guardian adjusted stopped medication condition aggravated changed result showed child poor adherence higher proportion previously reported chronically ill child malaysia 28.4 child inflammatory bowel disease korea 33.2 several possible reason discrepancy discussed west china second hospital one largest child hospital west china undertakes substantial amount clinical work including treatment referral consultation critically ill woman child chengdu sichuan province southwest china diagnosis treatment level many disease child high china child admitted hospital often serious disease difficult treat may result poor adherence medication time majority included patient week possible patient guardian familiar method requirement medicine use leading poor medication adherence however current adherence rate similar previously reported anti-infective medication adherence child seen outpatient department france 65.1 reported meta-analysis prevalence rate medication adherence antiepileptic drug current study common patient disease respiratory system disease digestive system disease neuromuscular system disease may similarity use drug various disease leading similar adherence rate medication additionally found anxiety depression relatively common guardian possibly study conducted spread coronavirus disease epidemic china fear among patient guardian related epidemic may affected rate anxiety depression regarding factor influencing medication adherence found lower education level guardian higher annual household income longer medication time associated higher medication adherence score similar result previous study family better economic condition tend better health literacy familiar method use timing drug medication adherence may better timing taking medicine also important factor affecting adherence patient may know use drug current result indicated lower anxiety score guardian predicted medication adherence novel finding present study addition found higher guardian educational level higher household income opposite effect medication adherence reason may follows 29.9 guardian non-parents study high educational level retired doe n't mean family income level high people higher educational level likely trust judgment experience likely listen doctor advice prevalence anxiety among guardian study higher reported meta-analysis anxiety parent young people chronic health condition however relationship anxiety treatment adherence received little research attention therefore clinical practice important develop health education session child chronic disease guardian improve adherence child content health education diversified multi-dimensional including knowledge chronic disease method taking drug dosage treatment duration issue requiring attention additionally evidence suggests adherence improved applying specific communicative consultation skill highlighting importance conducting close follow-up patient chronic disease establish therapeutic partnership family promote constructive collaborative dialogue medical team family present many method measure medication adherence including subjective measurement i.e. morisky scale objective measurement therapeutic drug monitoring tdm electronic device pickup/refill rate method advantage disadvantage study medication adherence various disease wide range medication adherence explained largely heterogeneity assessment method objective measurement could quantitatively calculate adherence conclusion relatively accurate however tdm expensive difficult patient accept high frequency method pickup/refill rate medication possession ration mpr defined proportion percentage day supply obtained either refill interval last refill end point fixed refill specific time period set mpr simple calculation method doe consider gap refill need continuous therapy multiple prescription consequently overestimated adherence value found using method proportion day covered pdc defined total day supply divided number day study participation patient required keep medical record medication record completely may difficult child although used objective measure ass medication adherence many study produced moderate high correlation self-reported questionnaire srqs monitoring device yet gold standard measure monitoring patient adherence srqs medication event monitoring system operating together continue emerge preferred effective method measuring medication adherence study involved several limitation first use random sampling select child participant second study used single-center design however sample size study relatively large west china second hospital accepts patient various province western china providing representative sample third assessment medication adherence mental health based self-reporting patient caregiver finding might therefore reflect actual practice multiple method assessment could used future self-report questionnaire structured interview tdm electronic device pickup/refill rate fourth proportion education level university high 70.1 participant chengdu capital city sichuan new first-tier city china good economic educational development result may overestimate underestimate relevant outcome measure future research conducted multi-centers used various adherence measurement method could address limitation conclusion majority child seen outpatient department west china low medication adherence depression anxiety among guardian common necessary implement health education measure improve medication adherence
