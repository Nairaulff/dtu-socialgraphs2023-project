defect tissue expansion widely used reconstructive option extensive skin lesion including giant nevus alopecia burn scar increase viable flap size enables primary closure donor site however extensive skin lesion reduce area available tissue expansion flap elevation particularly pediatric patient expander placement flap design may always best condition back-cuts rotation flap transposition flap used maximize use expanded tissue random-pattern flap expansion known greater survival compared non-expanded tissue nevertheless circumstance expanded flap may risk poor vascularity related location size lesion despite aid tissue expansion expanded flap may maximally utilized unfavorable condition expander inevitably placed unfavorable location long back-cut narrow flap base compromising flap circulation excessive rotation particularly distant flap forearm lesion lead kinking flap pedicle posing threat vascularity prior history wound problem severe scarring also result poor circulation
