protected area natural environment within residential area covid-19 pandemic specifically study people preferred protected area close home visiting urbanized region fig similar pattern reported several national park public response pattern seems closely related avoidance behavior increased probability covid-19 infection risk long-distance travel remote site frequent human contact populated

protected area mainly used people living proximate distance adaptable pandemic situation increased visitation hand protected area largely dependent distant traveler operating cost management became vulnerable prolonged pandemic event contrast pre-covid visitation pattern remote conservation area unique ecosystem type convenient transportation attracted visitor long-distance transportation network finding suggest preliminary conceptual clue may support conservation management planning uncertain pandemic situation first establishment sufficient conservation area would satisfy increased public demand populated natural open space enhance resilience human well-being particular believe increased conservation capacity contribute flow cultural ecosystem service e.g. recreational ecosystem

development large area natural ecosystem essential requires lot time effort implement developed urban sector study small protected area peri-urban region showed resilient recovery visitor covid impact moreover small habitat patch fragmented landscape higher conservation value biodiversity urban development pressure coordinated network small conservation area may higher potential achieve multiple conservation objective protect biodiversity ecosystem service time high uncertainty third maintaining strong link protected area local community essential overcome prolonged effect pandemic covid-19 outbreak long-distance travel limited short-distance visit became important activity highlighting importance accessible protected area sustaining people livelihood hand excessive recreational infrastructure attract long-distance traveler may jeopardize sustainable conservation effort large protected area pandemic situation persists finally adaptive management planning resource allocation
