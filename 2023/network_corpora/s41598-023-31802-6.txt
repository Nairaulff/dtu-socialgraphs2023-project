detection eliminate infected pig vaccination common swine disease including porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome porcine circovirus associated disease classical swine fever actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae routinely performed commercial swine farm vaccination routinely practiced using conventional needle mostly via intramuscular route although vaccination intradermal route efficacious major swine pathogen commercially available procedure may transmit virus bacteria animal especially disease delayed onset clinical sign subclinical infection pig infected low virulence strain may
