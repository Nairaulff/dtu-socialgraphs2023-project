capybara density estimated based observation propose hypothesis density capybara decrease particular site immature stage dubitatum may seek alternative host blood meal consequently larva nymph

high realized reservoir competence ehrlichia hydrochoerus leading increased prevalence ehrlichiae questing dubitatum nymph adult two month later ehrlichia chaffeensis low prevalence observed dubitatum prevented statistical analysis nevertheless considering capybara previously reported infected pathogen plausible dubitatum also acquires ehrlichia chaffeensis feeding alternative host marsh deer vertebrate region known infected ehrlichia chaffeensis however noted marsh deer parasitized stage dubitatum co-feeding transmission ehrlichia muris– like agent demonstrated ixodes scapularis larva
