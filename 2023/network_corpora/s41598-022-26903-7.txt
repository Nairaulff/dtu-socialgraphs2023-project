free βhcg mom however polyhydramnios opposite trend frequency premature rupture membrane pregnancy induced hypertension highest among pregnant woman level free βhcg mom 0.2 thus level serum marker predict occurrence wide array maternal/fetal adverse outcome mechanistic point view numerous function hcg related adverse outcome instance hcg role enhancement production progesterone corpus luteal cell induction angiogenesis uterine vasculature moreover promotes fusion cytotrophoblast cell differentiation make syncytiotrophoblast cell importantly hcg contributes blockage maternal immune macrophage action foreign invading placental cell cause uterine growth parallel fetal growth thus surprising abnormal level free βhcg associated wide range maternal fetal adverse outcome fact hcg contributes several functional structural aspect healthy pregnancy cohort patient rate consanguinity 19.6 although evidence suggest association consanguinity genetic congenital abnormality well adverse pregnancy outcome rate different different group woman categorized based level free βhcg mom sharony al. detected low maternal serum concentration hcg 0.57 assessed woman approximately woman found missed abortion detected case trisomy chromosomal abnormality patient population yet reported perinatal complication pregnancy study conducted ong maternal serum free βhcg 10th centile reference

fact low maternal serum free βhcg might indicate insufficiency placenta patient βhcg level 0.2 include chromosomal anomaly analysis oapr value 1/7.7 calculated considering acceptable value oapr 1/22–1/25 i.e positive screening result 4–5 oapr indicates free βhcg level 0.2 used novel indication amniocentesis since result found 0.25 total patient indication result improvement final oapr screening chromosomal abnormality besides observed higher risk structural abnormality patient free βhcg level 0.2 indicates necessity precise follow-up patient using higher standard anomaly scan moreover fetal maternal adverse outcome higher patient free βhcg level 0.2 thus pregnancy considered high risk pregnancy receiving higher level care including follow-up pregnant woman monitoring blood glucose blood pressure exact monitoring fetal weight delivery specialized center recently large-scale study turkish population reported association serum level papp-a sga gdm prom preterm pprom common

abnormality regulation pathway might contribute pathology high level βhcg shown predictor preeclampsia another study iranian pregnant woman fact βhcg mom associated five-fold increase risk developing preeclampsia mentioned study finding accordance result pregnancy free βhcg level 0.2 oapr different intermediate low risk group since oapr calculated 1/39.5 group recommend inclusion parameter maternal age fetal percentile free βhcg mom/papp-a mom assessment patient based parameter second trimester screening sequential combined test nipt recommended pregnant woman finally since free βhcg

future study needed ass role factor paternal age residential area nutritional deficiency chemical biological contamination result interpretation βhcg mom level current study ass possible impact factor obtained result role factor risk trisomy controversial instance quattrocchi reported correlation paternal age risk trisomy study reported positive inverse association factor risk trisomy respectively taken together current study indicates importance free βhcg mom identification at-risk pregnancy term fetal maternal outcome proposes extreme βhcg mom value indicator necessity invasive testing pregnancy fact βhcg mom 0.2 regarded risk factor adverse maternal fetal outcome irrespective presence abnormality result possible explanation association adverse outcome low high level βhcg extreme value reflect inappropriate function placenta study limitation analyze effect socioeconomic status study although study conducted large group pregnant woman result confirmed multicenter prospective study finally study patient reported outcome following telephone call month post-delivery may reliable potentially subject recall bias
