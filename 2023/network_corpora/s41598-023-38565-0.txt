introduction rapid increase use nonoperating room anesthesia nora site service past decade use anesthesia service gastrointestinal suite increasing 10.8 17.3 patient suite frequently receive anesthesia without endotracheal tube tubeless anesthesia patient frequently transition different depth anesthesia although sedation usually performed safely sedation without controlled airway shown higher incidence respiratory depression insufficient ventilation patient treated non-ors resulting incidence death event also higher patient treated note cardiorespiratory arrest hypoxia occurred frequently patient underwent upper procedure underwent colonoscopy evl one challenging endoscopic procedure due high risk perioperative bleeding reflux consequently evl usually performed deep anesthesia without endotracheal intubation deep anesthesia reduce body movement choking etc. thus reducing risk bleeding endotracheal intubation shown great promise achieving airway protection
