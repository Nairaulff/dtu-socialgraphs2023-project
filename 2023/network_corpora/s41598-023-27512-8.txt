characterised behavioural change individual adapt behaviour response change environmental condition circumstance individual within population adjust behaviour response environmental stimulus change plasticity still show consistent inter-individual difference behaviour personality indeed extent variation behaviour may affected personality difference present population example exploratory

widespread cause consequence correlation well understood quantifying understanding consequence correlation personality plasticity animal requires repeated measurement behaviour taken environmental

movement behaviour easily captured technology directly relate established personality construct exploration activity excellent example use precision technology applied farm animal technology provide repeated detailed behavioural data offer opportunity advance understanding personality plasticity whilst improving farm animal management protocol focussing individual requirement indeed location
