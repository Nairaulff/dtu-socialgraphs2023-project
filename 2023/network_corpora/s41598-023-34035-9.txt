chain reaction rt-pcr viral non-structural ns1 antigen detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay elisa former technique sensitive detection anti-dengue igm igg antibody immunoassay also helpful diagnosis however lower sensitivity serological test due decreased antibody titre acute phase lower specificity due cross-reactivity related flavivirus longer blood persistence limit usefulness

climatological change pattern seasonality influence breeding abundance aedes mosquito vector contribute heterogeneity infection among african resident however limited study available ethiopia make difficult comprehend dynamic dengue urge investigation epidemiology reported low proportion dengue study hospital located close lake hawassa mosquito-borne infection expected common may explained hospital regional referral function draw severe case severe pneumonia shown initial report also possible caregiver likely seek care lower-health facility hospital suspected malaria similar acute febrile illness observed recent report result would likely representative expand scope study include lower-level health facility capture mild acute febrile illness early diagnosis dengue essential reduce risk complication prevent spread virus given growing body evidence showing dengue outbreak ethiopia introducing rapid dengue testing aid make appropriate fever management specifically determining viral aetiology fever may minimize unnecessary prescription antibacterial antimalarial drug despite small number dengue case current study still able observe antimalarial treatment given child tested negative malaria later found positive dengue one limitation study dengue marker ns1 antigen examined analysis sample dengue rna using sensitive technique rt-pcr might recovered additional dengue case may allowed identification circulating dengue serotypes anti-dengue igm igg detection could provided information level recent previous dengue infection circulating community small number dengue case detected precluded conclusion associated clinical characteristic dengue attempted categorized severity generalizability result febrile child may constrained selection bias arising institution-based study conclusion low prevalence acute dengue virus infection observed febrile child presenting tertiary hospital however dengue commonly misdiagnosed febrile illness unnoticed leading overuse antimalarial antibacterial medication finding suggest dengue need adequately highlighted including importance integrate dengue diagnostics fever-management approach study urgently required level transmission community level ecological factor associated dengue fever lessen threat outbreak characterise circulation strain
