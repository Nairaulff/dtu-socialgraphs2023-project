introduction age-specific reproductive performance phenomenon widely observed natural population animal remains key issue population ecology general common pattern observed reproductive performance increase young age so-called early-life improvement achieve peak middle age decrease older age so-called late-life decline senescence level individual early-life improvement reproductive performance considered result acquired breeding experience age and/or reduced investment first breeding attempt turn within-individual decline reproductive performance advanced age commonly attributed senescence process resulting irreversible accumulation damage consequently lead loss organism function thus early-life improvement late-life senescence may considered main intrinsic process determine observed age-related pattern reproductive performance animal natural population despite significant role intrinsic factor play shaping age-related reproductive pattern extrinsic driver also indicated crucial age-dependent breeding performance context environmental variation interaction age seem greatest importance environmental stress period low food availability high predation increased habitat

phenotypic quality indeed high-quality bird usually live longer low-quality individual thus may achieve higher reproductive success turn afr significantly affected clutch size without effect remaining reproductive trait negative influence afr number egg laid clutch indicates population level female starting breed first time later age produced smaller clutch mean maternal investment clutch seems associated selective appearance female population crucial finding study reproductive performance shaped intrinsic factor related age may also affected extrinsic environmental condition experienced individual adult life showed age-specific pattern two four examined reproductive trait i.e. laying date clutch size modified variation ndvi case laying date young old female experiencing relatively poor environmental condition low ndvi exhibited lower performance i.e. delayed egg-laying initiation female age breeding relatively good environmental condition high ndvi turn middle-aged female started lay egg earliest coped evenly well across different environmental condition low high ndvi observed similar pattern case clutch size young old female produced smaller clutch experiencing low ndvi compared female breeding high ndvi middle-aged female laid largest clutch performed similarly different environmental condition low high ndvi result agreement prediction young old breeder may suffer inexperience aging respectively therefore may especially affected poor environmental condition fact resource-poor environment represented lower ndvi may generate higher reproductive effort increased maternal investment young breeder experienced bird thus young inexperienced bird may reduce reproductive performance poor environmental condition decrease cost early-life reproductive effort mechanism may allow increase investment subsequent breeding attempt e.g. environmental condition better individual experienced thus able cope better adverse condition case old female observed bred poor environmental condition experienced reproductive senescence higher rate implies old individual due aging process may incur higher cost self-maintenance poor-resource environment compared rich-resource one consequently result declining investment reproduction fact environmental condition especially experienced early life including developmental environment impose great effect rate reproductive aging already recognised indeed previous research adult long-lived bird shown individual age environmental condition may interact affect reproductive trait breeding date clutch size offspring production however majority study documented environmental condition influence mostly young bird middle older age class lead conclusion environmental variation may play especially important role shaping pattern early-life improvement breeding performance fact result research fit picture contrast date study documented environmental variation experienced individual adult life influence rate reproductive senescence old age study significantly contributes existing knowledge showing variation environmental condition encountered across adult lifespan may indeed important driver affecting reproductive senescence late life however result previous study research indicate pattern age-by-environment interaction generally complex may non-uniform across reproductive trait specie characteristic studied population proxy used determination environmental condition conclude demonstrated environment may interact age individual affect reproductive performance provided evidence environmental condition experienced adult life may also play significant role shaping age-specific reproductive pattern short-lived avian specie previously documented long-lived bird specifically
