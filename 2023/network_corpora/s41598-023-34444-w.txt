introduction classical klebsiella pneumoniae cause various infection pneumonia urinary tract infection bacteremia commonly host comorbidities however recent decade several report primarily taiwan case community-acquired bloodstream infection bsis liver abscess caused hypervirulent pneumoniae hvkp healthy individual spread bacterium major concern worldwide unlike classical pneumoniae hvkp cause infection including meningitis necrotizing fasciitis endophthalmitis metastatic infection multiple organ four major virulence factor pneumoniae capsule lipopolysaccharide fimbria siderophores reported capsule protect bacterial cell phagocytosis antimicrobial peptide suppress host immunological response hvkp produce hypercapsule consists mucoviscous extracellular polysaccharide envelope bacterial surface robustly typical capsule specific capsular type associated increased hvkp pathogenicity plasmid-borne regulator mucoid phenotype rmpa transcriptional regulator enhances capsular polysaccharide synthesis capsule production previous study shown deletion rmpa reduces colony mucoviscosity virulence mouse resistance human serum additionally plasmid-borne rmpa found accurate marker hvkp high
