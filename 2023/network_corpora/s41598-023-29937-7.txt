functioning debate one main rationale difference response environmental change among specie provide basis preventing deterioration ecosystem function service niche complementary i.e. community member different niche complementarily cover wide range environmental niche space differential response environmental change among specie community termed response diversity expected stabilize ecosystem function disturbance response diversity applied originally compensatory population dynamic different organism response environmental change later came embrace behavioral response pollinator visitation response weather condition predator activity air temperature herbivory rate response food quality although conceptual notion response diversity play significant role ecosystem service stability widely recognized extent response diversity contributes stability enhancement ecosystem service real world clear relationship diversity ecosystem service particularly well-studied pollination locally
