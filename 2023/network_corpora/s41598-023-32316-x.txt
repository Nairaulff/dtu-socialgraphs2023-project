introduction world health organization astana declaration primary healthcare highlight importance individual participation decision-making related patient healthcare patient role altered remarkably past decade patient supposed active partner rather passive recipient healthcare national academy medicine formerly known institute medicine also stated patient-centered care play crucial role delivery high-quality healthcare committee quality health care america national academy medicine describes patient-centered care process comprises providing care respectful responsive individual patient preference need value ensuring patient value guide clinical decision today shared decision-making sdm regarded supreme model decision-making patient representative policy-makers hospital health insurer addition sdm way physician patient join force select proper healthcare service based evidence well patient value preference sdm proposed approach involving mutual respect participation doctor patient also reported improve adherence medication usage enhance perception patient healthcare-related quality life reduce possibility visiting emergency room patient atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease another systematic review meta-analysis focusing type diabetes patient found positive correlation sdm better decision quality patient knowledge patient risk awareness patient decision aid pda designed facilitate making choice among healthcare decision evidence-based promote patient participation improve knowledge manage expectation healthcare outcome two basic type pda paper-based computer-based paper-based pda easy quickly feasible implement routine clinical practice whereas computer-based pda presented different way flexible well providing information patient satisfaction decision-making improved sdm previous study comparing process sdm paper-based computer-based approach found computer-based decision-making aid significantly prolonged consultation process however another study comparing paper computer-based questionnaire measuring health outcome patient undergoing total hip arthroplasty indicated use electronic form questionnaire enabled efficient reliable collection data jawaid al. found resident perception computer-based assessment good nevertheless majority study sdm conducted western country preferred model sdm differs chinese european american chinese patient preferred family centered decision-making european american patient tended make choice addition study specifically compared patient satisfaction/anxiety level paper-based computer-based pda sdm aimed investigate difference patient anxiety well satisfaction patient undergoing paper-based pda receiving computer-based pda medical center southeastern asian country method

sdm campaign started developed pda since pda renal biopsy wined jct competition beginning implementation sdm used paper-based pda sdm turned paper-based pda computer-based pda since december patient renal disease requiring renal biopsy hemodialysis clinician initiate process sdm facilitated pda addition also taught clinician use paper-based computer-based pda since launch sdm campaign retrospectively collected result questionnaire administered sdm conducted division nephrology tcvgh may june besides process sdm initiated in-patient out-patient setting decision made discussion patient physician either via paper-based computer-based pda topic sdm include type dialysis choose renal insufficiency hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis receive renal biopsy order obtain precise diagnosis yes questionnaire developed joint commission taiwan widely used hospital taiwan implementing sdm validity questionnaire reviewed expert addition short term test–retest reliability investigated first patient receiving sdm considered acceptable intraclass correlation coefficient 0.75 variable included analysis follows age gender education anxiety satisfaction knowledge acquisition whether sdm helped patient know pro con decision whether sdm helped patient know care whether sdm helped patient make choice participation sdm beginning implementation paper-based material used decision aid paper-based pda prepared critical appraisal evidence-based medicine five-page document provided help explain content routine visit clinic ease utilization designed sdm platform

knowledge acquisition knowledge acquisition strongly associated satisfaction sdm contrast decision yet made sdm associated greater satisfaction sdm table pearson correlation coefficient variable involved shared decision-making process full size table discussion first study comparing effect paper-based computer-based pda anxiety level implementation sdm southeast asian country found anxiety level reduced significantly sdm especially used paper-based pda previous review article indicated physician empathy strongly linked reduction patient anxiety addition waldron al. research also indicated power imbalance inevitably existed healthcare professional patient furthermore patient acquired emotional reassurance doctor anxious satisfied could explain anxiety level patient reduced significantly sdm however found computer-based pda effective paper-based pda reducing anxiety level previous study found computer-based decision aid significantly lengthened consultation doctor acted largely information provider patient time one proposed barrier practice sdm doctor might time discussion patient using computer-based decision aid addition werner al. found younger people anxiety using computer mentioned result section patient receiving computer-based pda study older used paper-based pda abovementioned reason could explain computer-based pda effective paper-based pda reducing anxiety level interesting note significant difference patient satisfaction patient undergoing paper-based pda receiving computer-based pda even though greater reduction anxiety level sdm patient receiving paper-based pda many previous study revealed sdm related better patient satisfaction methodological review found significant difference data integrity time complete survey data consistency among diverse survey questionnaire method including paper-based laptop computer-based tablet computer-based tablet app short message service another study compared paper- computer-based questionnaire mode measuring health outcome patient undergoing total hip arthroplasty significant difference detected two method questionnaire item physician empathy strongly linked reduction patient anxiety patient acquired emotional reassurance doctor anxious satisfied moreover satisfaction rate relatively high group paper-based vs. computer-based 92.3 vs. 92.5 reason probably explain anxiety level improved yet satisfaction remained current study nevertheless tsai investigated implementation patient-centered mobile sdm platform healthcare worker evaluation found mobile sdm offer patient family easy way address concern healthcare professional improves relationship meaningfully use survey questionnaire electronic format facilitates efficient reliable data collection therefore still recommend using electronic form sdm process gender reported affect patient perception importance participation however study addressed impact gender process sdm current study found female tended make decision sdm knowledge acquisition sdm reason phenomenon warrant study design sdm address issue addition education informed clinician likely make decision rather patient could explain patient higher education level tended make decision sdm current study nearly half participant made decision family previous study mentioned family involved sdm however family involvement differs based type illness treatment choice patient culture previous study noted chinese valued family-centered decision-making european american however ethnic chinese living america seemed prefer traditional sdm extent european american nevertheless study sdm originated western country research non-western country warranted better understand cultural issue related sdm study included patient underwent computer-based pda compared receiving paper-based pda three reason explain phenomenon first beginning sdm campaign clinician familiar process secondly paper-based pda might lost collection lastly missing answer paper-based pda must discard data final analysis computer-based pda would check completeness questionnaire automatically limitation current study follows first single institute study external validity finding insufficient second included patient nephrotic problem moreover study design retrospective therefore bias-free lastly randomized control trial selection bias inevitably existed perform sample size calculation advance conclusion according result current study paper-based computer-based pda reduce anxiety level implementation sdm paper-based pda seemed better regard addition patient level satisfaction high matter format adopted sdm study comparing patient perception/satisfaction among different type pda warranted fill knowledge gap literature
