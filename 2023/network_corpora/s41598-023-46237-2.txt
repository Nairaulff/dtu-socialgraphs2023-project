research indicates dog intuitively select dietary macronutrient composition dominated protein fat feeding dog npmd known affect serum urine fecal metabolite concentration compared feeding upcd dry dog food diet although meaning change still requires research finally intestinal bacterial flora play fundamental role pathogenesis canine human ibd feeding npmd shown stimulate growth balanced gastrointestinal microbiome dog including increase relative abundance bacteria associated protein fat utilisation comparison dog fed upcd dry dog food member genus also produce butyrate protein amino acid fermentation thus contribute intestinal homeostasis diet essential part exposome observation accordance biodiversity hypothesis stating microbial exposure early life developed immune system adulthood may also explain eating carcass outside negatively associated later life contributing exposure diverse microbiota fresh ingredient including vegetable root fibre phytonutrient source part npmd contain variety microbe many may beneficial gut health well indigestible soluble fiber act prebiotics fermented colon bacteria produce gut health promoting short-chain fatty acid studied association consumed food item incidence later life item belonging non-processed meat-based diet style raw bone cartilage berry associated significantly adulthood protective effect raw bone cartilage increased increasing feeding frequency largest fed daily almost daily couple time per week eating raw bone cartilage may several benefit fed puppy adolescent dog chewing behavioural element dog

chewing item well predisposing effect incidence later life discussed later chewing raw bovine femur bone also shown effective removing dental calculus dog effect shown extruded chemically-coated rawhide preparation therefore explain beneficial effect raw bone cartilage either bone composed primarily inorganic calcium phosphate cartilage contains chondrocytes collagen glucosamine proteoglycan aggregate made glycosaminoglycans hyaluronic acid chondroitin sulfate glucosamine precursor synthesis glycosaminoglycans gastrointestinal glycoprotein mucin essential mucosal defense glucosamine glycosaminoglycans modulate microbiota glycosaminoglycans promote intestinal growth wound repair effect inflammatory mediator disease activity ibd patient may improve intestinal membrane integrity dog collagen collagen hydrolysate treatment shown significantly reduce mucosal damage score facilitate faster regeneration damaged mucosa cartilage glycosaminoglycans shown increase uptake iron diet avoiding anemia symptom commonly seen whole prey-like diet including ground bone cartilage source animal fiber containing soluble insoluble coarse may provide source substrate gut health promoting short-chain fatty acid production fermentation mimicking ancestral whole-prey diet including bone cartilage material also possible explanation association eating carcass outside later life result also indicated protective role eating berry later life berry eaten mainly wild blueberry vaccinium myrtillus contain variety flavonoid polyphenols phenolic acid pyruvic acid chlorogenic acid compound anti-inflammatory immunity enhancing chronic disease preventing property human reviewed blueberry shown significant antioxidant anti-inflammatory activity fed dog blueberry also shown protect dog exercise-induced oxidative stress moreover finland berry often picked forest many dog even eat directly plant forest therefore dog also get exposed diverse forest microbiota according biodiversity hypothesis promotes healthy microbiome balanced immune system eating berry berry picking season possible explanation answer couple time year significantly different control case dog gray wolf canis lupus consume berry seasonally available abundant may even provision pup human meal leftover table scrap offered puppy young dog found significantly associated later life protective effect increased feeding frequency hence exposure dog leftover protection development traditionally popular finnish dish meal composed fish meat vegetable root mushroom buttermilk fermented milk product berry whole grain product example black rye bread oatmeal raw meat scrap trimming fatty part might similar effect npmd moreover whole grain product well root vegetable contain indigestible soluble fibre beta-glucans gut health promoting effect likely explanation grain product showing significant association adulthood another explanation could popular finnish dog food cooked home long time soaked slow-cooked porridge made oat millet barley buckwheat whole grain rice vegetable salt often served raw meat egg protein source finnish name yrjölä porridge moreover healthy human might share mouth resident beneficial microbe like streptococcus salivarius dog transferred puppy contact table utensil hand furthermore offering leftover dog indicative intense human-canine bond decreasing stress puppy experience affecting immune system positively dog owner leftover also decreased chronic gastrointestinal sign acute gastric dilatation-volvulus surgery finnish dog organ meat found protective within home-cooked diet contain vitamin micronutrient like vitamin selenium coenzyme q10 may positive impact gut health clear blood pancake found protective one possible explanation blood protein and/or source iron rawhide fed puppy couple time month often associated increased risk later life risk increased increased feeding frequency highest rawhide given one time per week may related low digestibility rawhide measured vitro dry matter disappearance dmd may pose risk gastrointestinal blockage intolerance especially dog tends swallow large size rawhide piece remain intact gastric intestinal phase however rawhide made leather industry by-product also possible toxic chemical used leather processing cause negative effect gut health saw study unfortunately scientific publication
