introduction soil largest carbon sink terrestrial ecosystem twice three time much atmospheric vegetation carbon pool accordingly slight loss soil may lead dramatic change atmospheric carbon dioxide level subsequently accelerate global climate change intensive agriculture based cropland management practice deteriorating soil quality resulting soil structure destruction nutrient loss soil erosion moreover reduce soil sequestration accelerate greenhouse gas emission therefore imperative develop new restoration type replace traditional intensive agriculture reverse process soil loss soil aggregation physical process protects soil organic carbon providing barrier decomposer thus affecting distribution stability thereof based hierarchical model soil aggregate consist many fraction mainly including macro-aggregates 0.25 micro-aggregates 0.25 generally macro-aggregates formed carbohydrate-rich plant residue associated soil organic matter increase nevertheless soil within

averagely table consequently higher root biomass responsible corresponding higher storage fine root supported fact higher amount stored fine root field compared field table fact several study

formation conversely minimal tillage experienced greater accumulation root residue resulted higher accumulation field furthermore fine root improved soil aggregate stability via interaction mycorrhizal fungi produced exudate binding agent promoted formation soil aggregate therefore higher input root residue soil could enhance capacity aggregate re-formation fact supported higher value
