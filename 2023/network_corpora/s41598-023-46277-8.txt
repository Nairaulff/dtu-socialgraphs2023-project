readmission refers occurrence patient admitted hospital related care within certain period often within day discharged hospital readmission cause significant financial burden avoidable waste medical resource also put strain healthcare system cost unplanned readmission united state estimated billion dollar annually creation hospital readmission reduction program hrrp affordable care act aca aimed

focusing intensive care unit icu readmission severe health consequence added economic implication average unplanned icu readmission occur within day initial hospital discharge patient readmitted icu significantly higher mortality rate ranging compared readmitted mortality rate ranging 3.6 8.4 reducing icu readmission rate important goal healthcare provider policymakers improve patient outcome
