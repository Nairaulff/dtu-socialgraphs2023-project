monitoring prevent people contracting disease worldwide approximately 1.6 million people die every year due waterborne disease caused biological contaminant affect country economic level pathogen major biological contaminant water thus important monitor presence recreational drinking water source pathogen include salmonella staphylococcus vibrio cholera legionella shigella escherichia coli coli coliform bacteria pathogen introduced water source enter human body directly drinking water indirectly bathing recreational water activity reason acceptable limit pathogen defined legislation

excreta human warmed-blooded animal coli type bacteria normally live intestine warm-blooded animal though toxic strain e.g. coli o157 cause abdominal cramp vomiting diarrhea even small amount
