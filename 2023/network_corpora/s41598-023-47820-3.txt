low-level resistance effort done better understand factor determining expression level enzyme limitation study low resistance rate antibiotic meropenem therefore excluded part analysis important take account study focus unimicrobial bacterial culture coli lead bacterial pathogen frame multimicrobial infection leading coli bacteremia multispecies community might critically influence antibiotic resistance gene expression lead pathogen often resulting lack accuracy antimicrobial susceptibility testing one micro-organism predict vivo success failure antibiotic therapy undeniable potential wgs-based technique replace dilution diffusion susceptibility testing guide clinical therapy currently phenotypical susceptibility testing still much cheaper faster performing wgs however probably change time since wgs getting cheaper wgs also provides massive amount additional information classic dilution diffusion susceptibility test provide virulence factor relatedness bacterial isolates additional information could great value investigate bacterial origin example conclusion conclusion study show wgs used valuable tool predict phenotypic resistance clinically relevant antibiotic treat coli bloodstream infection high specificity sensitivity however excessive beta-lactamase expression exceeding activity inhibitor lead lower accuracy genotypic test detect resistance beta-lactam
