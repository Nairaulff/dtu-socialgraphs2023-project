introduction breast milk usually source nutrition infant first month life human milk protects wide range disease complication respiratory illness allergy autoimmune disease infant mortality also positively affect development intestinal microflora reduces severity various infectious disease previous study shown breastfeeding infancy lead reduced rate infection iron deficiency lower obesity rate better intellectual performance child however human milk found contain heavy metal pose risk toxic element accumulation potential health effect infant mother several study examined composition trace element iron zinc copper manganese breast milk excessive level element adverse health effect breastfeeding infant lead cadmium arsenic extensively studied human milk high level manganese cobalt mercury chromium also reported human breast milk serve biological indicator exposure pollutant important route maternal excretion trace element previous report highlighted harmful effect smoking second-hand smoke shs exposure composition breast milk reduce protective property negatively impact infant health development tobacco smoke contains compound carcinogen breast milk smoking mother expose infant environmental compound present tobacco smoke breastfed infant smoking mother likely experience allergy sleep disorder increased colic upper respiratory tract infection cardiac rhythm disorder sudden infant death syndrome however exact underlying mechanism behind increased risk associated smoke exposure still investigated whileit initially believed risk smoking limited smoker determined 1980s second-hand smoke harmful health even non-smokers metal concentration differ mainstream smoke inhaled smoker sidestream smoke literature study assessed concentration different trace element milk lactating mother worldwide however study specifically examining effect active passive exposure cigarette smoke milk element concentration limited therefore study aimed compare level

health increase risk various disease present study effect active second-hand smoking milk concentration different essential toxic element investigated found level significantly higher breast milk passive active smoker compared nonsmoker also significant difference level non-smoker active smoker group several trace element considered potentially toxic child exposure element related anemia cancer interference bone growth adverse effect nervous system etc who/fao established provisional tolerable weekly intake ptwis different toxic metal µg/kg total respectively smoking contribute increasing level toxic metal breast milk infant child particularly risk toxic metal accumulation result lower body weight slower excretion well decreased immunity heavy metal absorption infant usually greater milk diet possibly due binding easily absorbed protein milk elevated level heavy metal milk may interfere function bioactive substance essential optimal development growth infant child killian reported cadmium lead increase oxidative stress adverse synergistic effect metabolic pathway child one important concern cadmium classified group1 carcinogen iarc toxic metal disrupts metabolism micronutrient iron copper zinc magnesium maintaining proper level microelements critical normal infant development cadmium metallic element found naturally environment pollutant contaminate soil absorbed crop consumed people diet smoking however recent data show concentration crop food decreasing food like cereal vegetable shellfish main source intake human rice significant source exposure many country ingested food absorbed study tendency higher milk level observed smoker suggesting level breast milk influenced smoking behavior mother regard one study showed milk concentration smoking mother lactation increased increasing cigarette consumption study revealed concentration transitional milk milk created following colostrum production four time higher smoker mother non-smokers grzunov letini´c documented negative effect smoking concentration blood mature milk transitional milk woman smoke effect second-hand smoking literature shown elevate breast milk woman exposed pregnancy cigarette smoke contrast another study showed smoking habit family mother smoking and/or pregnancy smoking father increased milk level difference statistically significant human exposure lead grown dramatically counted one hazardous environmental exposure potential source lead exposure includes lead-based paint occupational exposure air water soil dust food particularly milk fish flour vegetable tea lemon juice tomato paste rice toy dried herbs/herbal medicine makeup product old metal pipe adulterated opium smoking based result ursinyova smoking habit significant effect breast milk lead content level milk slightly higher mother smoked pregnancy non-smokers 5.13 vs. 4.51 µg/kg difference significant hand another study showed smoking significantly increased milk level also grzunov letini´c recorded negative effect tobacco smoking concentration transitional milk effect second-hand smoking literature szukalska confirmed tobacco smoke exposure increase concentration colostrum mature milk level breast milk reflect endogenous exogenous exposure toxic metal published data documented pregnancy breastfeeding increase bone turnover thus increase movement mother skeleton similarly fetus child sensitive adult human target toxicity nervous system kidney depending chemical form factor observed responsible mercury pollution including food mainly fish canned food although rice may another source methylmercury asian amalgam dental filling contact lens smoking cosmetic medical instrument chlor-alkali industry steel industry cement plant plastic industry certain agriculture pharmaceutical industry yalçin report passive/active smoking pregnancy increased concentration breast milk another study also revealed smoking habit pregnancy number cigarette smoked increased level significantly contrast örün found exposure cigarette smoke pregnancy second month delivery affect concentration breast milk one limitation study small sample size may limit generalizability finding additionally cross-sectional design allows observation association doe establish causality therefore research larger sample size longitudinal design needed confirm extend finding future study larger number woman evaluation toxic metal concentration depending amount tobacco exposure recommended public health information messaging essential inform pregnant woman adverse effect cigarette smoking pregnancy especially breastfeeding information also include possible adverse effect maternal secondhand smoke composition breast milk conclusion conclusion passive active smoking mother significantly increased level human breastmilk finding support necessity increased concern information lactating woman avoiding passive active exposure cigarette smoke due negative effect breast milk additional risk infant
