studied previously however prior study compared value oct image result seem controversial study analyzed value preeclampsia patient according presence retinal change compared patient one another woman normal pregnancy see whether retinal change associated choroidal change additionally cvd along measured vertically horizontally oct image obtain detailed information choroidal hemodynamic change patient diastolic systolic bps well urine protein level higher preeclampsia patient retinal change compared without retinal change urine protein level indicate severity preeclampsia word severe preeclampsia associated change value result consistent kaliaperuma al. reported diastolic positively correlated retinopathy severe preeclampsia addition garg documented subclinical retinal choroidal thickening setting severe preeclampsia foveal nasal temporal higher preeclampsia patient retinal change compared group difference preeclampsia patient without retinal change woman control group suggests presence retinal change may affected sfct result among preeclampsia patient discrepancy previous study may explained difference disease severity presence retinal change among participant possible analyze severity preeclampsia presence retinal change previous study since provide data garg reported difference value patient without visual change trended toward significance similar result cvds oct b-scan face image also higher preeclampsia patient retinal change compared group also differ preeclampsia patient without retinal change control group cvd value also showed positive correlation value inferred increased vascular area choroid might major factor choroidal thickening pregnancy previously azuma reported larger choroidal luminal area associated higher systolic pregnancy choroidal overperfusion increased vascular resistance pregnancy-induced hypertension patient srd demonstrated using laser speckle flowgraphy also srd associated thicker current study regarding significant positive correlation among ocular blood pressure choroidal blood flow increase choroidal vessel luminal area might caused increased volume circulating blood pregnancy addition face oct image revealed broader macular area compared oct b-scan image suggesting increased diameter haller vessel responsible choroidal thickening among clinical parameter associated preeclampsia bcva systolic blurred vision vaginal bleeding correlated cvds correlation visual disturbance choroidal parameter consistent previous result garg high systolic suggests severe state preeclampsia therefore severity disease seems associated choroidal parameter meanwhile study showing inverse correlation vaginal bleeding preeclampsia earlier pregnancy positive correlation post-partum bleeding limited data association vaginal bleeding preeclampsia severity late pregnancy necessitating investigation several limitation study first sample size relatively small consisted asian patient also suggested change differ according pregnancy trimester since study included pregnant woman third trimester could analyze difference choroidal parameter according gestation week nonetheless study evaluated choroidal change preeclampsia according retinal change believe previous study clearly demonstrated addition value also cvd value oct b-scan face image analyzed proving correlation cvd value showing broader area choroidal change conclusion cvds higher preeclampsia patient retinal change compared without retinal change control cvds correlated showed association blurred vision vaginal
