best knowledge study first study provided genetic support association smoking risk frailty ageing result generally consistent former observational epidemiological study example cohort study 94,550 chinese older people aged year old conducted reported increased association smoking 0.0036 0.0027–0.0045 similarly another cohort study participant aged year conducted canada reported smoking

elderly higher hazard ratio :0.68 0.57–0.80 although analysis suggested potential causal role smoking risk frailty along observational evidence biological mechanism underlying relationship smoking ageing fully understood several possible explanation frailty ageing measure based health deficit accumulation smoking lead emergence development many tissue injury disease example cigarette smoke inflammogen cause influx activation inflammatory cell inflammation measured high level inflammatory marker interleukin-6 il-6 c-reactive protein crp associated poor physical performance muscle strength older people addition study identified smoking depressed muscle protein synthesis induced elevated expression myostatin muscle atrophy f-box mafbx associated inhibition muscle growth muscle catabolism besides smoking also major risk factor cardiovascular respiratory disease may greatly affect health mortality older people present study evidence indicated smoking pernicious health frailty ageing smoking cessation could substantially reduce risk frailty decrease mortality elderly however research government policy focused adolescent overall adult population rather older adult little attention paid benefit smoking cessation elderly doctor willing provide advice smoking cessation young patient rather older patient older smoker also lack motivation smoking cessation therefore great significance generate evidence importance smoking cessation frailty ageing provide reference government policymaker medical advice study several strength first systematically analyzed five smoking
