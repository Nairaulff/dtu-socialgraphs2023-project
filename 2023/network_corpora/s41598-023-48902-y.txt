introduction greatest number covid-19 case highest mortality rate world recent estimate show million case million death accountable covid-19 ever since beginning pandemic study shown racial disparity respect morbidity mortality associated covid-19 example covid-19 related mortality disproportionately higher midwestern latino county well county greater number people speaking spanish first language similarly study done louisiana showed though black represented total population covid-19 hospitalization covid-19 related death among black indicating existing racial disparity understanding overcoming existing racial disparity covid-19 comorbidity burden consulting pattern health care access health seeking behavior intergenerational interaction considered extremely important public health priority challenge availability information extent type racial disparity could help identifying factor associated inequality measure overcome order achieve greater control covid-19 existence greater number case mortality among racial minority could lead lower control spread virus achieving ensuring equity across different population group especially important preventing treating covid-19

rate significantly higher among older adult men similar finding cross-sectional study using publicly reported covid-19 mortality data showed hispanic 2.17 time greater risk mortality compared white california addition study also showed mortality rate significantly higher among hispanic state including missouri 5.26 new york 3.98 massachusetts 2.60 nevertheless several study showed mortality rate due covid-19 differ significantly hispanic race example retrospective cohort study included 4,413 patient mortality rate differ significantly black hispanic similarly multicenter retrospective study laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patient aged year in-hospital mortality differ white black hispanic spite finding noted study either single institution study conducted outside california national study within united state hence study finding show mortality rate higher among hispanic could due characteristic specific hispanic california racial characteristic californian population show predominance hispanic 39.4 followed white 36.5 asian 15.5 black 6.5 although hispanic constitute majority california considered disadvantaged group regard many economic social factor could increase impact covid-19 population example hispanic california time likely reside area greater risk exposure covid-19 compared white addition significantly greater number cumulative covid-19 case lower rate cumulative testing among hispanic compared race california study covid-19 mortality rate highest among white 12.9 followed asian pacific islander native american 12.0 hispanic 10.8 black 10.5 highest mortality rate among white could due higher comorbidity burden measured elixhauser comorbidity index however adjusting covariates multivariable analysis showed risk mortality highest hispanic compared race distribution comorbidities showed three highest among white hispanic whereas eleven highest among black notably comorbidities highest among hispanic diabetes mellitus obesity liver disease many previous study shown diabetes obesity independent risk factor mortality among covid-19 patient subsequently analysis within study also showed higher mortality among hispanic due higher prevalence comorbidities addition diabetes obesity covariates atrial fibrillation coagulation disorder liver disease chronic renal failure congestive heart failure metastatic cancer independent risk factor mortality total sample previous study shown preexisting comorbidities could adversely affect prognosis survival covid-19 patient given greater proportion comorbidities among black population study surprising hispanic greater mortality risk black contribution comorbidity towards mortality researched greater detail study hispanic greater rate diabetes obesity liver disease known risk factor mortality covid-19 although black greater number comorbidities independent risk factor mortality addition could ass stage severity disease patient admitted hospital could different among different race also could include available comorbidities study could comorbidities available database could contributed racial disparity mortality observed study could led bias estimate however included available comorbidities model reduce bias future study focus factor researching racial disparity covd-19 outcome study icu admission rate higher hispanic patient compared racial group similar finding study done lee found hispanic minority higher in-hospital mortality higher icu admission rate compared white similarly another cross-sectional study found hispanic black asian pacific islander native american greater rate covid-19 hospitalization icu admission in-hospital mortality white show hispanic population vulnerable susceptible adverse covid-19 outcome received greater access care advanced treatment also found mortality higher among male hospitalization increased increasing age consistent finding previous study example meta-analysis biswasa colleague showed covid-19 related mortality significantly higher among male patient increased increasing age increased covid-19 mortality among male could due explained role male hormone towards increased expression angiotensin-converting enzyme ace-2 making vulnerable sars-cov-2 infection adverse prognosis well addition ace-2 expression achieved activation ace-2 gene chromosome female two copy chromosome could heterozygous male always homozygous making susceptible greater level ace-2 expression female may greater protection adverse clinical outcome due mosaicism x-linked heterozygous allele greater covid-19 related mortality among older adult could due factor increased expression ace-2 decreased immunity decreased organ function depleting physiologic reserve vitality greater level preexisting comorbidities limitation spite finding study limitation icd-10 code used identifying hospitalization covid-19 preexisting comorbidities could resulted coding error misclassification bias sid administrative database doe laboratory treatment related data unavailability laboratory data restricted stratifying hospitalization based severity disease could affected accuracy finding unavailability treatment related data including medication remdesivir tocilizumab steroid could affected result study important cofounding factor affecting covid-19 related mortality since used hospitalization data could get data prior admission post-discharge mortality rate due covid-19 could different mortality prior admission post-discharge would considered finding study could due specific characteristic hispanic population within california therefore finding interpreted cautiously generalized hispanic population within united sates conclusion study covid-19 hospitalization california risk all-cause in-hospital mortality significantly higher among hispanic associated older age male sex comorbidities given existence racial disparity hospital outcome among covid-19 patient overarching objective providing equitable care eliminating disparity achieving comparable outcome remain challenge overcome research focus identifying exact mechanism racial disparity covid-19 outcome observed study would help developing initiative overcoming disparity achieving equitable distribution healthcare
