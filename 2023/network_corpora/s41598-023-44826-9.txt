lockdown highly contagious syndrome infectious conjunctivitis accounted many outbreak various leisure healthcare educational framework among pediatric population common transmission thought direct contact poor hand hygiene sharing contaminated object also attributed transmission infectious conjunctivitis hand personal hygiene campaign issued government raising awareness covid-19 virus transmission spread vastly across country contributing lower rate infectious conjunctivitis meticulous hand hygiene practice ability reduce transmission common pathogen among pediatric population described lockdown end different outcome depending age group 6–11 year 12–18 year age group restriction termination resulted lower conjunctivitis rate pandemic decline conjunctivitis rate among age group statistically significant time series analysis even adjusting seasonal variation establishment better hand hygiene practice mentioned earlier might explain lower rate conjunctivitis among group even lifting covid-19 restriction despite positive effect hand hygiene might another plausible explanation reduced post-lockdown conjunctivitis rate rooted mental behavioral effect covid-19 pandemic child teen suffer higher level depression anxiety influencing integration capability social skill resulting gravitation toward online social interaction real-life gathering among younger age group 0–1

conjunctivitis rate covid-19 pandemic reflect regular everyday activity pattern seen among age group correlate return usual routine might also clarified immaturity child age affecting ability perform hygiene practice maintain social awareness pathogen transmission adenovirus responsible viral conjunctivitis known facilitate outbreak seasonal pattern typically contagious winter spring interestingly found post-lockdown month additional non-typical peak occurred end spring lasting summer similar form winter peak followed usual winter seasonal peak pattern seasonal switch described similar study conducted israel respiratory syncytial virus rsv demonstrated similar non-typical seasonal pattern australia israel unparalleled virus outbreak summer occurring pandemic restriction gradually lifting added peak lasting summer support human behavior etiology seasonality pattern acute viral conjunctivitis fact individual spend time indoors proximity others might play significant role higher incidence acute conjunctivitis winter low temperature considered favorable pathogen additional summer peak could also non-infectious form acute conjunctivitis lack exposure common allergen among child young age due covid-19 pandemic restriction along over-cleanliness i.e. hygiene hypothesis resulted higher rate allergic manifestation conjunctivitis previous study examined differential diagnosis treatment patient presenting pink eye general practitioner ophthalmologist nine country demonstrated higher tendency diagnosis allergic conjunctivitis among general medical practitioner compared ophthalmologist spring summer season study large portion diagnosis made pediatrician general practitioner therefore strengthening result regarding lower rate infectious conjunctivitis pediatrician tend diagnose patient pink eye allergic conjunctivitis spring summer fact doctor made majority diagnosis gave conjunctivitis diagnosis strengthens result concept immunity debt may also underpin atypical surge acute conjunctivitis case post-lockdown prolonged isolation lockdown likely diminished exposure various pathogen leading accumulation immunity debt social interaction resumed post-lockdown heightened susceptibility due debt could contributed uncharacteristic summer peak conjunctivitis case suggested concept may hold true infectious agent transmitted via respiratory tract e.g meningococcal illness influenza applicability pathogen transmitted via direct contact many causative organism conjunctivitis remains questionable deserves study conclusion acute conjunctivitis episode among southern israel pediatric population dropped significantly covid-19 pandemic lockdown among age restriction termination elevated rate conjunctivitis diagnosis summer followed typical winter rate might suggest seasonality nature infectious conjunctivitis might associated greater extent human behavior winter temperature lockdown changed behavior teenager also lockdown kept lower rate disease future study needed evaluate long-lasting effect covid-19 pandemic acute conjunctivitis among pediatric population limitation study based assumption absence diagnosis associated absence morbidity theoretically lack diagnosis system may due patient opting avoid medical consultation pandemic due fear reduced access health care occur disease perceived mild public conjunctivitis lavista evaluated correlation covid-19 pandemic restriction internet search interest regarding infectious conjunctivitis demonstrated vast decline rate viral conjunctivitis large-scale population study using online search metric combined data reduced emergency department-related visit pediatrician account majority diagnosis study although acute infectious conjunctivitis one common pediatric infection account many encounter in-office consultation among general practitioner pediatrician might claim diagnosis might accurate eye disease might confused infectious conjunctivitis due overlapping manifestation study antibiotic prescribing habit among non-ophthalmologists found main difficulty differentiating viral bacterial etiology determining whether infectious study distinguish viral bacterial etiology include etiological data
