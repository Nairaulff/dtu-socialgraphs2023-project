best knowledge first study investigated manual dexterity young basketball player comparing performance sportsman non-sportsmen peer basketball group showed better value manual dexterity test statistical significance compared peer playing sport peer play sport conclusion state playing basketball positively influence manual dexterity development young population however study needed investigate influence sport include participant smaller age range addition first study using crt reliable simple test measuring manual dexterity basketball player however psychometric data exist regarding task child play sport practical future implication eye-hand coordination bimanual visuomotor coordination manual dexterity main skill required basketball player fundamental achieve good level performance typical gesture sport dribbling passing catching throwing shooting movement dynamic changing environment monitoring manual dexterity could useful identify deficiency development sport-specific skill lack manual dexterity study showed could done reliable easier cheaper time-consuming tool furthermore might useful know young person playing basketball least two year higher score inactive peer play sport hence practice sport specific effect development manual dexterity aspect could useful parent choosing sport child example child impaired manual dexterity development proven benefit practicing physical therapy movement catching throwing shooting way playing basketball could contribute improve manual dexterity inclusive non-experimental context strength limitation study limitation first three group number participant due excluded meet inclusion criterion age range wide control possible influence hormonal change puberty period especially female participant test administered different time day could affect manual dexterity performance however best knowledge previous study examined crt reliability sportsman particularly basketball player
