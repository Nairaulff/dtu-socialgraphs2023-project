inflammatory response activated bacterial challenge named secondary sepsis present study early secondary sepsis despite reduced inflammatory response spleen animal contained fewer bacteria animal similar trend seen liver blood vivo thus weakened inflammatory response associated reduced bacterial killing neither immune-active organ blood lower splenic growth animal might caused reduced splenic uptake blood increased clearance bacteria model bacteria negligible organ spleen liver data shown addition low bacterial count spleen associated low count blood indicating reduced uptake mechanism making increased splenic bacterial killing plausible strong correlation growth spleen blood might also imply increased splenic killing contributes lower blood bacterial count seen group fig spleen

important bacterial removal process liver active uptake bacteria blood recently shown uptake reduced secondary sepsis might promote lower bacterial growth liver particularly noteworthy significant

associated increased bacterial killing study far result obtained intravenous intraperitoneal induction irrespective type bacterial challenge trauma seems elicit similar response endotoxin infection result also likely valid trauma whether augmented bacterial killing applies later shown study immunosuppressive phase known warranting study however might speculated evolutionary benefit protecting animal additional harm invading bacteria early acute phase severe trauma infection although extrapolated caution model may show similarity community-acquired sepsis whereas model comparable early nosocomial infection icu based finding increased need synergistic β-lactam-aminoglycoside combination treatment doe seem urgent maximum bactericidal antibiotic therapy seems important connection recent retrospective study restricting patient recruitment community-acquired bacteraemia demonstrated better effect addition one single dose aminoglycoside β-lactam treatment comparative study investigating effect combination contrast mouse porcine immune system share similarity physiological response sepsis similar human physiognomy also suitable intensive care treatment including sedation vasopressor mechanical ventilation might additionally mitigate inflammatory response adding strength clinical relevance model addition model complies international expert consensus pre-clinical sepsis study however limitation model challenge bacteria intravenous infusion might clinically resemble administration contaminated infusion rare nowadays caecal ligation puncture technique advantage resembling onset clinical infection difficult standardise varying number specie blood immune-active organ thus significantly reducing power study using coli endotoxin followed coli bacterial challenge might another limitation however coli common gram-negative bacterial specie phenomenon endotoxin tolerance species-specific bacterial finding spleen liver reported study organ major site clear
