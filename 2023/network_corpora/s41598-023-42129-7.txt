introduction since industrial revolution human activity especially industrialization process developed country consumed large amount fossil energy leading rapid increase greenhouse gas emission global warming one biggest challenge facing world twenty-first century cope climate change promote building community shared future humanity country need reduce greenhouse gas emission jointly according world meteorological organization wmo earth nearly one degree celsius warmer industrialization began trend global temperature pre-industrial level action taken climate change severe impact economic social development current trend moreover climate issue large-scale spatial temporal externality require coordinated global response china world largest industrial country carbon emitter since reform opening china economic social development achieved remarkable result also led continuous growth carbon emission causing significant damage natural environment september chinese government solemnly pledged 75th session united nation general assembly china would increase intended nationally determined contribution indc strive peak carbon dioxide emission achieve carbon neutrality city essential part china carbon emission main carrying space carbon sink function critical administrative unit implementing dual carbon goal policy november national development reform commission ndrc issued
