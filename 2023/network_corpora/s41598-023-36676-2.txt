measure among critical measure mandated wearing mask public place bus subway hospital cinema shopping mall people also advised limit participation crowded activity worst pandemic public gathering place disinfected frequently primary purpose action reduce likelihood covid-19 patient releasing pathogen air healthy individual inhaling prevention control measure place guizhou province september new local covid-19 patient reported study aim explore impact long-term covid-19 prevention control respiratory infectious disease selecting representative chronic acute respiratory infectious disease respectively study utilized exponential smoothing model predict number case guizhou province parameter test result prediction model demonstrating success research revealed covid-19 prevention control measure also positively impacted suggesting similar effect respiratory infectious disease useful measure wearing mask study result indicated varying impact acute chronic respiratory infectious disease research demonstrated covid-19 pandemic affected number infectious disease case based mode transmission however study showed decline infectious disease due pandemic rather using predictive model explore cause duration intensity impact different infectious disease rapid decline case occurred first 1–2 month covid-19 prevention control measure time focus primarily covid-19 active detection infectious disease reduced temporarily halted furthermore patient willingness behavior seeking medical care affected additionally covid-19 prevention control measure reduced spread acute respiratory infectious disease incubation period short 1–7 day led short-term decrease case moreover research result showed long-term decrease number case persist context covid-19 prevention control measure returning predicted state month later likely due public declining willingness comply regular prevention control measure increasing psychological fatigue contrast apart initial 1–2 month decline began decline significantly 11th month downward trend lasting month even longer chronic respiratory infectious disease long incubation period month year covid-19 prevention control measure reduced spread mycobacterium tuberculosis infection possibility healthy people however effect could observed several month becoming particularly evident area severe epidemic guizhou province study revealed normalized covid-19 prevention control measure guizhou province might long-term impact potentially maintaining decline number case month even longer month implementation contrast impact measure may short-term case declining approximately month also believed limited contact people due lockdown working home stay-at-home strategy played crucial role decreasing exposure pathogen related disease spatial aggregation analysis demonstrated normalized covid-19 prevention control measure effectively reduced case county guizhou case exhibited reduction varying degree particularly area highest number case however area remain severely affected conclusion covid-19 pandemic china public required wear mask gathering place reduce outdoor gathering ensure gathering place regularly disinfected sterilized long-term preventive measure proved highly effective prevention control respiratory infectious disease successfully preventing covid-19 also significantly reducing number case prevention control measure may lead long-term positive impact short-term impact providing crucial guidance future prevention control effort china particularly area high incidence
