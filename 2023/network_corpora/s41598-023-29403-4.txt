related function tracheal mucosa intact tracheal mucociliary muco-system barrier remove exogenous stimulus however mucosal injury reduces clearance capacity mouse model airway obstruction shown airway epithelial cell regulate growth fibroblast prevent overgrowth fibroblast causing lumen obstruction hillel showed compared non-scar epithelium epithelium within isgs ilts morphologically abnormal although isgs ilts reduced epithelial thickness ciliary cell secretory cell isgs signifificant increase pathological basal cell expression.this suggests epithelium play important role pathogenesis type stenotic fibrosis experiment rabbit tracheal mucosa regenerate acute injury alone ability mucosal regeneration weakened cartilage mucosal injury chronic persistent damage mucosa involving cartilage may result airway stenosis tracheal stenosis mainly caused granulation tissue hyperplasia week operation scar contracture observed rabbit week operation also confirmed gross anatomy suggests choose different type stenosis according different time point animal study benign airway stenosis provide different type stenosis animal model study interventional therapy benign airway stenosis conclusion cartilage injury key factor formation benign airway stenosis rabbit mucosa play certain role formation airway stenosis acute injury airway mucosa alone unlikely cause airway stenosis combined cartilage injury may aggravate degree airway stenosis chronic persistent damage mucosa involvement cartilage cause airway stenosis
