introduction nitrate nitrite level currently increasing due excessive use fertilizer industrial development nitrate common contaminant drinking water especially agricultural area use nitrogen fertilizer increased concentration drinking water source since 1950s addition agriculture leachate waste accumulation pollution due human animal waste cause considerable increase nitrate concentration surface groundwater nitrate unstable human body metabolized human enzyme nitrate reduction activity bacteria may convert nitrate nitrite nitrogen compound affect physiological state human health consumption nitrate absorbed upper gastrointestinal tract easily excreted saliva transformed nitrite oral bacteria acidic condition stomach nitrite altered nitrogen trioxide nitric oxide nitrogen dioxide nucleus nitric acid hno nitric oxide lipophilic molecule involved various physiological pathophysiological process also first gas molecule described mediator signaling pathway recent evidence suggests involved adjustment thyroid function perhaps thyroid artery blood flow adjustment nitric oxide hydroxyl radical superoxide anion hydrogen peroxide h2o2 free radical considered oxidative stress oxidative stress general term used describe state damage caused reactive oxygen specie high reaction potential toxic lead oxidative damage cellular macromolecule protein lipid dna recently possible association thyroid dysfunction reactive oxygen specie increasingly considered high dos nitrate also inhibit iodine uptake cause hypertrophic change thyroid gland decreased iodine intake lead lower production thyroid hormone thus increase production thyroid-stimulating hormone tsh association thyroid disease risk metabolic syndrome hypertension glucose hdl triglyceride waist circumference
