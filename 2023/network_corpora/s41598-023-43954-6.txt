specie geographic distribution specie trait anthropogenic factor evidence phylogenetically similar specie higher spillover risk certain taxonomic group i.e rodentia carnivora harbor higher zoonotic pathogen richness turn specie geographic distribution affect pathogen exposure specie greater geographic range area altitude breadth likely occupy different habitat chance coming contact variety host specie fomite higher thus increasing pathogen exposure indeed geographic range overlap high number specie reported positively correlated greater virus richness fast-lived specie hypothesized higher pathogen richness tend resilient human disturbance allowing thrive anthropogenic environment allows make use new available resource e.g. anthropogenic food source declining competing specie population due hunting live close proximity human lead higher population density fast-lived specie promoting spread many pathogen another hypothesis based trade-off reproduction immunity fast-lived specie invest energy reproduction resulting nonspecific weaker immune response disease instance fast-lived bird shorter incubation period lower natural antibody level lymphocyte however limited evidence support claim mammal study three wild rodent specie found fast-lived specie smaller antibody response slow-lived specie however cooper found lower longevity fast-living ungulate carnivore primate correlated lower white blood cell count hence pathway life history trait influence pathogen richness may result reproduction immunity trade-off may also include different trait affect pathogen exposure persistence alternative hypothesis suggests slow-lived specie higher pathogen richness specie longer life span hypothesized encounter pathogen provide time pathogen multiplication colonization larger-bodied specie provide niche pathogen establishment e.g greater surface area ectoparasite greater energy requirement food intake thus greater risk foodborne pathogen anthropogenic factor livestock density land-cover change also affect pathogen transmission host specie energy allocation immunity high livestock density facilitates pathogen transmission increase risk pathogen spillback livestock wildlife turn land-cover change urbanization conversion habitat agriculture also result increased human-wildlife contact change resource availability instance urbanization result loss habitat resource leading poorer health condition wild animal reduction resource subsequently lead decreased energy allocation immunity increased pathogen richness conversely specie able take advantage anthropogenic food source e.g rubbish bin plant backyard streetscapes domestic animal allowing adapt urban environment urban agricultural area may also release contaminant environment directly affect wildlife health immunity anthropogenic intrinsic specie trait predictor pathogen richness examined recent literature example gibb found higher wildlife host specie abundance agricultural urban
