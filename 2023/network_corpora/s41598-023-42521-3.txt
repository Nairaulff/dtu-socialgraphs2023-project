introduction recent year number volume publication using citizen science source research data increased corresponding project involving public within various scientific field seen growing number participant characterized participation non-professional scientist professional science project citizen science grown relevance past decade seen massive growth citizen science activity participant volunteer accordingly variety project along gradient structured semi-structured unstructured approach large one end spectrum detailed highly organized research project well-defined protocol involving select group highly trained participant end global format include simple task opportunistic recording data collection project related ecology biodiversity public health benefited involvement citizen science allows enrolment large number volunteer generate data scale individual researcher would unable achieve digitization boosted program new possibility designing managing project facilitated development communication technology e.g. internet platform online marketing campaign social medium email communication allowed researcher reach recruit wide audience application smartphones enabled participant collect data recording tagging tracking capability although citizen science project ecology remain diverse recent trend indicate shift towards mass participation model simpler approach increasing number project relying solely computer-based participation global non-taxon-specific observation platform like inaturalist observation.org gather million specie record contributing total

participation privileged time-constrained societal group trigger interest topic might otherwise forced ignore fact reducing complexity task required participation shown address issue time constraint significant barrier participation group help overcome underrepresentation certain group citizen science reported study domroese johnson nov addition aspect inclusivity low diversity participant

message objective rather seems trigger prevention whereas participant prioritize promotion however planning evaluating citizen science project might helpful better understand certain assertion outreach activity relate participant intention particular interest would find whether project communication appeal pre-existing motivation leading participation whether message adapt even create motivator take part analysis potential split participant regulatory focus might helpful understand relation alignment project goal participant motivator study limited several factor example limited possibly unrepresentative set respondent since survey also included part recording networking behavior evaluated completion time relatively long addition e.g data protection reason possible contact

different data structure thus possible difference type employment income group respondent due difference basic population also realize generalizability evidence inference based two considered project limited however focus compare two project similar scientific goal research subject course mosquito-associated project around world inclusion feasible lead author due significant time human resource investment required nevertheless believe result make important contribution science citizen science least provide thought consideration reflection innovative idea study compare fully digital fully analogue citizen science project research subject decouple information participant structure motivation influence preference research subject e.g. differing animal plant specie target doe project organization make difference imbalance project communication regarding biodiversity mapping disease prevention also apparently equally strong influence motivation citizen scientist overall experience organizing scientist participant i.e knowledge take part simply transferred digital analogue project vice versa even target taxon program objective quite similar
