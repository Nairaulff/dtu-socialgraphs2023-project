introduction canine specie despite progress veterinary medicine neonatal mortality remains relatively high around one ten puppy dying first three week life one major mortality risk factor identified recently puppy studied many mammalian specie birth weight newborn specifically low birth weight lbw puppy time higher mortality risk attributed lower energy reserve thermoregulation vitality compared normal-birth weight nbw high-birth weight hbw individual moreover lack vitality evidenced lower apgar score make access mammary gland colostrum intake difficult resulting reduced passive immune transfer thus higher risk infectious disease high mortality lbw represents important ethical economic challenge breeder veterinarian making study early risk factor priority improve wellbeing vulnerable newborn besides deficit passive immune transfer metabolic issue gut microbial composition may impact newborn health gastrointestinal tract git mammal harbor trillion bacteria forming gut microbiota playing many different role health host promoting maturation immune system mucosal integrity metabolite production many study suggest early development gut microbiota may impact infant growth first month life health adulthood thus altered gut microbiota development lead higher risk neonatal mortality disease like enterocolitis also long-term adverse effect promotion type-1 diabetes increased adiposity human piglet numerous study demonstrated gut microbiota low birth weight newborn differed one normal birth weight manipulating gut microbiota could improve outcome like oxidative

also importance bacteria reported related healthy canine microbiota compared microbiota dog suffering enterocolitis bacteria anaerobe bacteria proteolytic activity able produce scfas protein although observed lower relative abundance decrease faecalibacterium butyrate producing bacteria lbw versus nbw interesting indeed based result could speculate modulation development scfa-producing bacteria fermentation product play crucial role colonocytes metabolism also genus highly sensitive giving credit hypothesis higher level oxygen lbw puppy mentioned previously finally difference microbiota

puppy harbour normal microbiota month neonatal death occurred first week life very-low-birth weight one higher risk death nbw one study needed explore development gut microbiota dying versus surviving newborn puppy result present study suggest potential preventive strategy reduce mortality lbw puppy example specific pro prebiotic strain could given lbw puppy soon possible stabilize microbiota limit potential dysbiosis also avoiding artificial milk antibiotic much possible highly recommended colostrum good source bacteria establishment microbiota antibiotic known induce dysbiosis particular proliferation facultative anaerobic bacteria limited difference high-birth weight hbw nbw observed recurring one day another notable difference observed d21 higher relative abundance faecalibacterium bacteroides respectively role butyrate-producing faecalibacterium gut health widely studied recently point became bioindicator inflammatory bowel disease abundance decrease human dog interestingly genus seems lower abundance young puppy compared adult dog increase abundance genus linked maturity puppy another genus observed higher abundance hbw puppy study bacteroides shown present lower abundance preterm infant genus also glycans produce butyrate reinforces protection pathogen gut obligate anaerobe synonym proper maturation git host thus higher abundance faecalibacterium bacteroides hbw puppy neonatal period could suggest maturation microbiota happened earlier puppy birth hbw puppy might able reach mammary gland ease compared brother allowing get colostrum potentially acquiring complete microbiota three week old first dry diet presented puppy might suggested hbw ingested food support higher need body weight inducing increased abundance bacteroides linked dry food consumption result would suggest early maturation git microbiota hbw puppy would give better protection sepsis gastrointestinal disease first week life since hbw puppy specifically studied usually considered among nbw remains difficult compare result literature hypothesis early maturation proved true fecal microbiota transplantation hbw puppy lbw puppy could prove another effective strategy stabilize improve microbiota stability lbw puppy using mature one hbw limit considered looking result present study first puppy involved considered lbw hbw remains higher similar study conducted specie individual variability microbiota composition major challenge top lbw studied good health survived first month life meaning microbiota might representative lbw puppy dying neonatal period puppy kennel
