introduction chronic pain present 1.5 billion people worldwide public health problem cause negative psychological effect lead low activity depression reduced activity daily living reduced physical activity level individual lead functional impairment disability various recommended exercise program increase physical activity despite perceived benefit increasing physical activity level cause low physical activity level individual well understood limited available research reported factor contributing low physical activity level individual complex varied qualitative research suggests variety factor influence barrier physical activity adult including pain fatigue risk associated physical activity kinesiophobia pain tolerance threshold also influence low physical activity level adult however previous study compared group healthy control comparison individual different level physical activity treating resolving fundamentally difficult american society anesthesiologist task force chronic pain management american society regional anesthesia pain medicine identified goal treatment patient include pain management functional capacity improved physical mental health improved

used identifying predictor future study may possible construct accurate model using ann machine learning addition limitation study small population difficult collect sufficient sample community-dwelling elderly individual limited independent variable constructing predictor community-dwelling older adult low activity however study examining factor contributing low-activity far compared healthy subject study thought valuable compare highly active low-activity ann often used big data analysis analysis continued subject study using ann small sample published continue monitor study using ann study able extract factor predict low level physical activity based reliable physical activity assessment result community-dwelling older adult history fall especially important factor low physical activity level individual conclusion study aimed extract factor predict low level physical activity among community-dwelling elderly people used mlp ann addition conventionally-used predict low level activity mlp found history fall predictor low level activity special attention therefore given fall prevention addition mlp appeared superior predictive model accuracy constructing accurate model may possible using ann machine learning addition result emphasize importance fall prevention improving physical activity level community-dwelling older adult chronic pain future cross-sectional study compare multiple analysis method show result improved accuracy
