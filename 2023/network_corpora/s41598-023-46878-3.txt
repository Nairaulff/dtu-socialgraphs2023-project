surgery consensus repair radial head fracture lcl fracture radial head often treated open reduction internal fixation orif radial head arthroplasty injury collateral ligament often restored anchor suture hinged external fixation however treatment ulna coronal process fracture especially type regan–morrey coronoid fracture still controversial study suggested coronoid process important role instability terrible triad injury elbow schneeberger study reported coronal process fracture humeral trochlear tendency anterior medial dislocation due loss anterior bone block affect stability elbow joint height coronal process fracture affect stability elbow joint obviously lead instability elbow joint anterior capsule elbow joint attached distal end coronal process 6.5 tendon biceps brachii attached distal end coronal process therefore fracture height coronal process thought necessary repair anterior bone soft tissue stability study recommended reconstruction radial head coronoid process fracture terrible triad injury however clinical study reported short-term mid-term follow type coronoid process fracture according regan–morrey classification stable radial head ligamentous complex completely restored antoni experience re-attaching anterior capsule coronoid process fracture tte improve clinical radiographic outcome year follow-up clinical experience think fixation coronoid process fracture important provide early stability elbow joint enable early functional exercise study result also confirmed fixation coronoid process fracture resulted good clinical outcome regardless lasso-plate technique orif fixation ulna coronal process fracture method including lag screw fixation micro plate fixation anchor screw fixation suture lasso technique common small coronal process tip fracture tip comminuted fracture use screw fixation easy cause iatrogenic fracture difficult accurately effectively fixed garrigues colleague reported greater stability fewer complication achieved use suture lasso technique coronoid fracture fixation tte however clinical practice found suture lasso technique lower stability elbow poorer ability prevent displacement fracture cadaveric biomechanical study also show suture lasso technique may provide resistance displacement coronoid compared lag screw technique result consistent clinical finding therefore used novel lasso-plate technique fix coronoid process fracture compared suture lasso technique lasso-plates play role buttress plate lasso-plate increase contact area soft tissue implant reduces pressure wire capsule insertion lasso-plate technique provided excellent biomechanical environment stability elbow joint would enable early functional exercise study result show month follow mean range flexion–extension motion

elbow motion arc lasso-plate technique group suggested better clinical outcome orif group thought lasso-plate technique group enabling early functional exercise one main reason clinical outcome better orif study mean operation time lasso-plate group significantly shorter orif group 98.4 min 116.7 min 0.001 suggested fixation coronoid process fracture lasso-plate technique easier fixation lag screw mini-plate easy master operate technology reduce iatrogenic damage shorter operation time operation damage thought another main reason better clinical outcome lasso-plate technique group limitation study one limitation non-randomized controlled grouping involvement different surgeon may partial impact research result another limitation use various implant coronoid process fracture radial head fracture lcl reconstruction could lead slight bias limitation could addressed designing prospective randomized controlled study future research conclusion tte serious injury clinic challenging fracture-dislocation elbow treat fixation coronoid process fracture lasso-plate technique especially type regan–morrey coronoid fracture could easier master operate could provide sufficient stability elbow joint enable early functional exercise along better clinical outcome lower surgical complication treatment tte recommend fixation type regan–morrey coronoid fracture lasso-plate technique would result better clinical outcome
