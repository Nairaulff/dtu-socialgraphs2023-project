introduction abo blood group system abo blood group system discovered karl landsteiner system discovered landsteiner alexander wiener form crucial part hematological system human body significant role blood transfusion hematological immunological disease person different blood type determined inherited genetic composition parent major blood group categorized four basic category blood group produce group-specific antibody plasma instance people blood group type-a antigen erythrocyte antibody antigen contributes process called agglutination agglutination indicates red blood cell reacted certain antibody blood doe agglutinate indicates blood doe antigen binding antibody reagent summary blood group a—has antigen red blood cell anti-b antibody plasma blood group b—has antigen anti-a antibody plasma blood group o—has antigen anti-a anti-b antibody plasma blood group ab—has antigen antibody second additional system classifying blood group system determines presence rh+ absence rh− protein individual erythrocyte i.e. rh+ refers rhd antigen expression rh− refers lack rhd antigen expression abo blood group may rh+ rh− based presence antigen surface jordanian retrospective study reported prevalent blood group 37.44 36.82 respectively followed 18.62 7.12 rh+ prevalent 88.73 compared rh−ve 11.27 another nigerian retrospective study reported type frequent 47.7 followed type 26.6 type 22.6 3.5 97.1 study sample rh+ furthermore libyan study reported negativity rate antigen higher blood group 5.83 followed 3.3 0.8 blood group difference chiefly related individual genetic ethnic factor blood-grouping system great value transfusion safety genetic research inheritance pattern paternity testing susceptibility certain hereditary disease duodenal ulcer diabetes mellitus urinary tract infection gastric cancer predisposition lower level von willebrand factor hemolytic disease fetus newborn hdfn one foremost cause perinatal morbidity mortality emergency occurs likely second pregnancy due status incompatibility lesser degree due abo incompatibility rh-negative mother sensitized antigen rh-positive blood group either previous pregnancy fetal rh+ erythrocyte subsequent incompatible transfusion develops antibody eventually leading hemolysis fetal erythrocyte hemolytic disease fetus newborn hdfn affect 3/100 80/100 patient per year maternal antibody destroy fetal red cell case lead bone marrow suppression process lead fetal anemia severe case progress edema ascites heart failure death fetus hdfn followed fetal medicine unit university jordan multiple intervention done depending stage hdfn starting fetal blood sampling ending multiple fetal blood transfusion case hdfn due rhd prevented immunoglobulin administration hdfn rarely caused abo incompatibility often severe incompatibility mother fetus different abo blood type resulting maternal antibody fetus erythrocyte type incompatibility common mother type-o blood group fetus blood group igg antibody responsible condition abo incompatibility one serious cause hyperbilirubinemia fetus leading jaundice anemia newborn requiring extensive treatment therefore comprehensive knowledge distribution pattern different blood type imperative effective prevention management fatal erythroblastosis fetalis maintaining blood bank reserve reducing morbidity mortality due blood transfusion since data regarding prevalence different blood group jordan limited conducted experiment evaluate distribution abo blood group among pregnant woman gynecology obstetrics department jordan university hospital jordan believe data aid health worker effective management prevention blood group incompatibility-related complication knowing nation blood group distribution aid allocating resource ass blood bank protocol would interesting run another study year compare result expecting change due immigration wave jordan witnessed last year method used retrospective study design include cohort pregnant woman

group 41.5 5.5 similar pattern result regarding blood group observed another retrospective study conducted konya turkey majority pregnant female rh+ blood also study reporting prevalence blood group described 15.8 pregnant woman attending antenatal care libya rh-negative negativity higher blood group 5.83 notably prevalence rhd-positive group patient 90.1 compared rhd negative group patient 9.9 contrast prevalence 46.6 rhd positive type patient reported nigeria similar result observed blood group well however study incidence blood group 38.9 lower prevalence 41.1 pregnant ethiopian woman receiving antenatal care sodo health center furthermore prevalence rh+ type generally higher study conducted across different location country according study conducted northern ethiopia negativity rate antigen higher blood group 3.7 whereas another ethiopian study revealed o-rh− blood group predominant 42.2 due variation ethnic genetic characteristic among population difference explained blood group determined study conducted bangladesh using smaller sample size participant reported blood group prevalent 35.8 notably described blood group second common type 29.3 followed 19.3 contrast result common also prevalence blood group higher result 15.6 percentage rh+ category 97.9 likewise another retrospective case–control study conducted sample pregnant woman delivered december march carmel lady davis medical center haifa israel reported prevalent blood group blood group 38.6 followed blood group nearly equal percentage 35.3 number stark contrast result prevalence 18.3 7.8 blood group comparable result general distribution appears different european population volken reported study distribution blood group switzerland commonest blood group followed blood group 45.2 40.9 group much 9.8 4.1 status also differed population higher rh-negative percentage compared although sample size greater previous study included pregnant woman one hospital amman jordan also since involve non-pregnant woman men child study result generalized whole jordanian population medical science even something commonly found demand equal attention caution i.e. case blood transfusion pregnancy strictly unadvisable assume treat patient rh+ blood without proper investigation good competent clinician must always cautious order appropriate testing case suspected non-sensitized rh– mother proper testing blood group type indirect coombs test must done caution exercised giving anti-d immunoglobulin injection gestational age week within delivery rh+ fetus immediately procedure done pregnancy may involve mixing maternal fetal blood abortion ectopic pregnancy amniocentesis benefit determining blood group type include awareness information regarding blood group type woman reproductive age conclusion majority pregnant female undergoing childbirth antenatal care clinic jordan university hospital positive blood group determining blood group type accurately help eliminate critical consequence abo incompatibility offer clinician opportunity take timely prophylactic measure study reflects population blood group distribution aim valuable member international donor bank result help draw worldwide blood donation map
