high inflammation state malnutrition atherosclerosis found hemodialysis patient severe periodontitis may atherosclerotic disease cumulative effect multiple factor therefore effect inflammation malnutrition atherosclerosis may enough detected study cross-sectional design stenvinkel proposed two type malnutrition may occur patient undergoing hemodialysis first type associated uremic syndrome per related factor associated uremia physical inactivity underdialysis dietary restriction psychosocial factor characterized modest reduction serum albumin level lower protein energy intake due uremic toxicity second type cytokine-driven type malnutrition refers type malnutrition due increased catabolism caused inflammatory cytokine increased resting energy expenditure due comorbidity associated inflammatory response second type malnutrition adequately treated nutritional therapy alone unless elimination concomitant comorbidities and/or cause chronic inflammation hypothesis study assumes possibility malnutrition due impaired nutritional intake caused decreased occlusal support however result study indicate occlusal status significant factor affecting malnutrition esrd patient undergoing hemodialysis contrast periodontitis known increase systemic inflammatory cytokine level significantly affected inflammation malnutrition status therefore cytokine-driven malnutrition might main driver mia syndrome population patient mia syndrome inflammation lead malnutrition periodontitis may contribute pathway several aspect first periodontitis increase oxidative stress insulin resistance may contribute burden systemic inflammation second cytokine produced locally periodontal tissue periodontitis periodontopathogen bacteria gingivalis may migrate bloodstream cause systemic chronic inflammation systemic chronic inflammatory response decrease action anabolic hormone insulin suppression protein synthesis moreover inflammatory response increase resting energy expenditure inflammatory cytokine interleukin also act central nervous system leading anorexia mia syndrome major risk mortality however fundamental solution established although goal treatment patient mia syndrome control inflammation often practically difficult improve comorbid condition study demonstrated periodontitis may inflammatory burden patient mia syndrome periodontitis controlled appropriate periodontal therapy thereby downregulating systemic crp level finding study suggested periodontal therapy may potential establishing treatment strategy mia syndrome study several limitation first occlusal status based information number position remaining teeth consider use denture actual occlusal contact might able accurately evaluate effect occlusal status study including examination actual occlusal status oral cavity quantitative measurement masticatory function required second may unadjusted confounding factor although adjusted much possible factor assumed influence mia syndrome previous study may residual confounding factor access dental care socioeconomic factor measured study addition kt/v indicator hemodialysis adequacy known influence mortality nutrition status however
