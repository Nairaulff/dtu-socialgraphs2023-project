introduction multiple cross-sectional longitudinal study shown physical activity cognitive functioning strongly intertwined decline course life however evidence causality relationship remains unclear previous result shown physical activity improve cognitive functioning recent study also suggested well-functioning cognitive skill influence engagement physical activity several mechanism could explain physical activity especially moderate intensity enhances general cognitive functioning example physical activity increase brain plasticity angiogenesis synaptogenesis neurogenesis primarily upregulation growth factor e.g. brain-derived neurotrophic factor bdnf addition repetitive activation higher-order brain function e.g. planning inhibition reasoning required engage physical activity may contribute improvement function turn mechanism could explain cognitive functioning may affect physical activity example cognitive functioning may required counteract automatic attraction effort minimization thereby influence person ability engage physically active behavior note mechanism mutually exclusive could therefore lead bidirectionally reinforcing relationship i.e. positive feedback
