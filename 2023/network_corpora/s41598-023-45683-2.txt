introduction since pathophysiology heart failure characterized myocardial necrosis apoptosis cause irreversible cellular damage establishing method prevent treat crucial hypertension type diabetes mellitus t2d primary/secondary cardiomyopathy valvular heart disease coronary artery disease prime contribute factor renal dysfunction anemia age sex may also contribute onset however factor alone accurately predict onset essence pathophysiology multiplexity many clinical medical physical habitual factor unlike single factor-related disease genetic disease therefore quantitative formula predict occurrence identify high- low-risk population needed recently machine learning progressed applied area prediction abundance risk prediction model sufficient discriminative ability although externally validated wang showed prediction onset year 0.5 year using machine learning random forest method support vector machine respectively however variable determine onset clarified study validated using another cohort external validation furthermore time window prediction relatively short several recent investigation revealed artificial intelligence -based prediction onset however either variable link onset probability onset clarified conquer unresolved issue recently implemented novel advance statistical testing allowed analyze significant combination clinical variable via limitless-arity multiple-testing procedure lamp hypothesized use lamp may clarify significant combination clinical variable predict onset individual combination factor prediction onset likely higher probability onset

reproducibility lamp well verified cardiovascular field importance predicting occurrence population-based study conrad incidence declined 3.6 3.3/1000 person-years however estimated absolute number individual newly diagnosed heart failure increased largely due increase population size age estimated absolute number prevalent case increased even several hundred thousand people study annual incidence rate approximately 2.5/1000 person-years similar report conrad disparity rate occurrence may partly attributable diagnosis cardiologist diagnosed using echocardiogram ct/mri examination blood test including measurement plasma bnp level top physical examination medical interview framingham criterion congestive heart failure however general physician may diagnose symptom physical examination may decrease incidence data japan mainly diagnosed using framingham criterion congestive heart failure plasma bnp level echocardiogram seems reliable precisely accurately diagnose several type although mortality attributable improved past decade still high 5-year mortality rival many cancer prevalence increasing aging population increased risk factor coronary artery disease hypertension smoking obesity t2d showed hypertension coronary heart disease common condition predating onset t2d electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy also associated increased risk metabolic syndrome component hypertension dyslipidemia diabetes recognized independent potential risk factor prevalence factor seems decreased u.s. europe seemingly increased asia especially japan respond unfavorable trend japanese government launched national health promotion movement 21st century health japan year movement decreased prevalence high blood pressure factor remained unchanged even worsened result attempt decrease incidence vain line evidence hint need treat risk also need identify high-risk people among general population provide caution possibility onset provoke behavior

multifactorial pathway hypertension t2d coronary artery disease assume combination factor independently prime and/or cause pathophysiology present study demonstrated combination factor tightly independently contribute high probability occurrence combination factor significantly independently cause due multiplexity pathology combination factor seems independent risk factor occurrence individual combination likely develop combination contains classic risk factor also contains factor t2d alcohol intake liver dysfunction smoking considered inhibitory however even factor contained combination combination contain deleterious factor contribute high probability developing alternatively combination may phenomenologically practically represent high occurrence combination may guarantee cause-and-effect relationship importantly people combination prone developing lamp combination number-dependent manner observation conversely suggests multiplexity cause intriguing know number predictive combination determine occurrence non-linear fashion fig supplementary fig accumulation risk factor increase probability occurrence stepwise fashion suggesting need investigate combination predictive lamp determine occurrence conclusion conclusion able identify combination clinical variable predict new-onset general population combination proportionally increased probability
