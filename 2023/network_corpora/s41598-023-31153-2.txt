introduction trypanosomes blood parasite infect wide range livestock disease caused trypanosomes include blood dyscrasia anemia leukopenia thrombocytopenia organ damage inflammation eleven different specie pathogenic trypanosomes studied africa three specie trypanosomes considered socioeconomically important highly pathogenic africa trypanosoma brucei trypanosoma evansi trypanosoma equiperdum recently complexity african trypanosome subspecies nature explored trypanosoma brucei group five ecotypes namely brucei brucei gambiense rhodesiense equiperdum evansi characterized rapid evolution easily invade new host region due minor mutation also induced laboratory condition parasitological serological study able distinguish subspecies therefore various genetic molecular method used increase accuracy diagnosing trypanosome subspecies oxidative stress triggered free radical play important role pathogenesis trypanosomiasis camel therefore determination oxidant antioxidant marker
