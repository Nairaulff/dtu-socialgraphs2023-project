introduction multimorbidity defined coexistence two chronic disease individual emerging issue owing increase population aging developed country multimorbidity focus characteristic clustering pattern multiple disease single patient interaction disease patient multimorbidity common older adult younger individual prevalence multimorbidity elderly certain cluster found individual disease patient multimorbidities multimorbidity older patient requires intensive diagnostic workups associated unexpected in-hospital event addition multimorbidity significantly associated higher mortality increased disability decline functional status lower quality life qol consequently multimorbidity primary contributor increased medical cost leading increased healthcare utilization hypertension common chronic condition associated increased risk cardiovascular disease disability impaired qol frequently manifest chronic condition diabetes mellitus obesity depression accordingly important consider multimorbidity diagnosis treatment patient hypertension however data effect multimorbidity treatment control hypertension limited addition current guideline sufficiently address older patient multimorbidity commonly excluded underrepresented major clinical trial hence little evidence manage elevated blood pressure hypertensive patient multimorbidity multimorbidity show different pattern understanding pattern helpful determining optimal treatment certain disease thus important understand whether certain comorbidities affect time could justify individualized recommendation treatment patient purpose analyzed data korean national health nutrition examination survey knhanes aimed identify association multimorbidity hypertension prevalence treatment control rate investigate

multimorbidity beneficial effect awareness treatment hypertension however observed control rate systolic patient multimorbidity lower patient without multimorbidity hypertension control rate reportedly lower among patient multimorbidities drug resistance impaired organ function may associated poor control patient multimorbidities study showed age sex marital status multimorbidity independently associated hypertension control patient hypertension two-thirds patient hypertension comorbidities however patient multimorbidity commonly excluded underrepresented major clinical trial thus limiting evidence best manage elevated patient hypertension multimorbidity expected increase burden multimorbidity hypertension important understand presence comorbidities affect inform future policy research additionally multimorbidity strongly associated polypharmacy thus necessary consider interactive effect drug-drug drug-disease interaction patient hypertension pattern multimorbidity differed patient controlled uncontrolled hypertension moreover several principal chronic disease larger impact control hypertension thus need focus managing key disease improve control study showed hypertension control strongly associated morbidity diabetes anemia ckd study several limitation used data nationally representative survey result generalized non-institutionalized korean population however result applied population country ethnic group due study design impossible analyse cause effect multimorbidities hypertension control finally patient responded survey regarding comorbidities instead tested comorbidities may gone unreported finally knhanes dataset provide information regarding medication treatment may impact relationship multimorbidity hypertension management conclusion multimorbidity positive effect treatment hypertension however control rate systolic blood pressure poor among patient multiple chronic condition attention paid hypertensive patient multimorbidities
