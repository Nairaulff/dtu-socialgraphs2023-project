introduction avian coccidiosis one important parasitic disease affecting domestic exotic bird worldwide responsible severe health economic concern poultry farm ornithological park private bird collection control parasitic disease mainly achieved chemotherapy e.g. anticoccidials vaccine however due increasing concern regarding antiparasitic drug resistance extensive research conducted aiming developing new alternative complementary strategy control coccidiosis bird collection including feed improvement house cleaning disinfection well natural solution like herbal extract essential oil probiotic prebiotics algae recently portuguese spanish brazilian danish researcher proposing use predatory fungi also known nematophagous fungi helmintophagous fungi larvicidal ovicidal characteristic complement antiparasitic drug control gastrointestinal parasitic infection domestic exotic bird biocontrol animal gastrointestinal parasitic infection using predatory fungi already proved accurate
