introduction accounting newly diagnosed men prostate cancer pca localized pca exhibit remarkable inter-tumor heterogeneity risk group diversity thus various treatment option proposed without solid decision criterion fact none possible treatments—such observation active surveillance waiting radical prostatectomy radiation therapy —have proven superior term cancer control localized disease thus initial treatment decision often based patient pca risk stratification patient physician treatment preference however real-world setting decision-making complex process affected cancer characteristic also various patient-level state/county-level regional socioeconomic factor thus comprehensive approach strongly needed patient physician order address issue several decision aid localized pca patient
