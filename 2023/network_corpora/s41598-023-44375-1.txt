introduction liver cancer sixth commonly diagnosed cancer third leading cause cancer-related death worldwide approximately 906,000 new case 830,000 death liver cancer characterized high incidence high mortality poor prognosis high symptom burden cancer-related fatigue crf rate report moderate-to-severe crf survivor still experience crf year post-diagnosis national comprehensive cancer network describes crf painful persistent subjective sense tiredness exhaustion related cancer cancer treatment crf seriously negative impact physical function psychology emotion cognitive associated higher mortality doctor nurse developing country lack strong understanding crf greatly underestimate prevalence harmfulness feel helpless improving crf far know standard intervention crf based current evidence although pharmacological treatment used prevent improve crf compared exercise intervention including planned structured repetitive activity aimed improving maintaining one component physical fitness least effective crf treatment american college sport medicine guideline exercise cancer published suggests moderate-intensity aerobic resistance combination training significantly reduce crf moreover patient exercised cancer diagnosis observed lower relative risk cancer mortality recurrence experienced fewer/less severe adverse effect however study focused patient low tumor invasion

cancer high tumor invasion symptom burden guideline primarily discus light exercise promote activity people low fitness based assumption light exercise might act similar path moderate-to-vigorous furthermore subgroup analysis exercise trend revealed maintaining exercise positive impact crf reducing exercise reducing exercise greater improving exercise randomized controlled trial reported year follow-up 18-week supervised intervention patient breast colon cancer showed positive effect exercise could maintained long term assessment long-term adherence efficacy exercise post-intervention hampered generally short period follow-up key encourage people participate maintain exercise improve patient exercise compliance persistence important consideration designing exercise program patient advanced cancer strength limitation strength study provided detailed description exercise habit analysis relationship exercise subgroup crf patient liver cancer presented exercise educational idea service provider well recommendation researcher improve design fatigue intervention measure patient high tumor invasion high symptom burden however study also limitation first single-center

conclusion study provided clear understanding exercise habit association exercise crf patient advanced liver cancer exercise education initiated earlier liver cancer survivor particularly without regular exercise experience designing exercise prescription sustained light exercise three time week compliant exercise habit interest e.g walking better flexibility individuation may practical way
