specie avoid intra-guild competition performing adaptive behavioural mechanism specifically spatial temporal and/or dietary niche segregation adaptation take special relevance complex carnivore community niche partitioning could involve positive cost–benefit balance facilitate coexistence among carnivore consequence asymmetric competition larger predator subordinate specie i.e smaller
