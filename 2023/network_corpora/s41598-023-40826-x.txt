introduction harmful effect smoking health limited smoker extends exposed secondhand smoke shs shs contains hundred toxic chemical approximately carcinogen thus shs exposure lead approximately 880,000 death every year globally shs cause various health problem including cardiovascular disease lung cancer breast cancer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease sudden infant death syndrome depression like smoking unhealthy lifestyle associated chronic disease known non-communicable disease ncds death globally caused ncds including cancer cardiovascular disease chronic respiratory disease diabetes accounting ncd death among ncds risk factor lifestyle behavior including smoking habit physical inactivity unhealthy diet excessive alcohol consumption considered extremely important based modifiability addition death caused smoking previous study report physical inactivity cause million death unhealthy diet cause million death excessive alcohol consumption cause 2.3 million death year therefore assessing controlling lifestyle behavior necessary ncd prevention management lifestyle behavior smoking non-smoking population reported different lifestyle smoking population unhealthier non-smoking population combined unhealthy lifestyle behavior harmful health single unhealthy lifestyle behavior detailed assessment lifestyle individual necessary best knowledge lifestyle individual exposed shs yet evaluated extensively thus present study evaluated association shs exposure lifestyle behavior using cross-sectional data male university worker method study participant study included

excluded population full size table discussion health problem caused shs exposure become serious problem therefore many country implemented indoor smoking ban public place including restaurant bar however people worldwide still exposed shs present study examined physical biochemical lifestyle behavioral parameter among participant without shs exposure shs exposure participant significantly higher bmi shs participant exposure shs reported associated overweight/obesity child study reported association shs exposure weight gain adult several mechanism including inflammation oxidative stress associated shs exposure overweight/obesity shs exposure group significantly increased also observed along increased bmi level associated oxidative stress shs exposure may induced oxidative stress participant however significant difference observed excluding smoking population see supplementary table suggested active smoke affected inflammation oxidative stress consequently enhanced difference distinguishing effect passive smoke active smoke difficult current smoker shs exposure thus assessing pure effect shs exposure current smoker excluded study information shs limited exposed shs however duration shs exposure also often used information shs duration shs exposure reported associated severity disease health problem physical biochemical difference might clarified according duration shs exposure study revealed shs exposure associated several lifestyle behavior including time diet alcohol consumption smoking habit viewing considered sedentary behavior common leisure activity sedentary lifestyle associated health problem prolonged viewing reported associated all-cause mortality type diabetes cardiovascular disease regarding dietary habit breakfast consumption fried food consumption vegetable fruit intake associated shs exposure breakfast important meal day affect physical mental health fried food consumption also risk factor cardiovascular disease hypertension obesity intake vegetable fruit associated reduced risk ncds including cancer cardiovascular disease chronic respiratory disease moreover significant difference observed dietary habit participant without shs exposure thus dietary habit shs exposure participant unhealthy compared shs exposure participant excessive alcohol consumption well-known risk factor various health condition chronic disease alcohol consumption frequency daily alcohol intake significantly different participant without shs exposure besides influence oxidative stress shs exposure sedentary behavior unhealthy diet excessive alcohol consumption might also cause increase level participant shs exposure comparison smoking status revealed prevalence current smoker high among shs exposure participant thus participant exposed shs likely inhale active passive smoke even unhealthy moreover assessed association shs exposure lifestyle behavior smoke-excluded population even though lifestyle behavior smoking population excluded found participant shs exposure likely unhealthy dietary drinking habit lifestyle behavior assessment study suggests participant shs exposure live unhealthy life combined unhealthy lifestyle behavior combined unhealthy lifestyle behavior significant risk factor all-cause mortality combination unhealthy lifestyle behavior show synergistic effect therefore increased number unhealthy lifestyle behavior associated higher risk mortality hence confounding factor assessed evaluate risk shs exposure previous study reported adherence body weight diet alcohol intake physical activity recommendation associated lower risk mortality former smoker participant shs exposure combined unhealthy lifestyle behavior preventing exposure shs promoting healthy lifestyle based multiple aspect would essential maintaining individual health reducing risk health problem study limitation shs exposure self-reported participant serum urine cotinine established marker shs exposure since self-reported shs exposure might underestimate intensity frequency shs exposure association shs exposure based cotinine level lifestyle behavior assessed future study another limitation single-center study limited age range subject osaka university indoor smoking ban public place except several smoking room implemented since thus study participant might exposed shs workplace compared participant institution moreover study participant university employee background including age educational level income might different population since age socioeconomic status reported impact lifestyle behavior study regarding different age range socioeconomic status needed performed conclusion evaluated association shs exposure physical biochemical lifestyle behavioral parameter present study bmi serum level elevated shs exposure participant shs exposure associated several lifestyle behavior including time dietary habit alcohol consumption smoking status moreover participant shs exposure likely unhealthy lifestyle participant without shs exposure best knowledge first study reveal lifestyle behavior participant exposed shs avoiding expose shs main target preventing health problem caused shs exposure lifestyle behavior among individual exposed shs discussed extensively however study showed participant shs exposure likely unhealthy life combined unhealthy lifestyle behavior combination unhealthy lifestyle behavior expected result serious health problem therefore comprehensive health promotion would necessary prevent ncds health problem caused shs exposure
