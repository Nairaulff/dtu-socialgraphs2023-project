limitation first study contains relative larger sample size however selection bias may present retrospective nature study second number class different according classification may lead inconsistent proportion complex classification simple classification specially relatively small sample size patient spi group may lead inadequate detection prognostic difference based proximal involvement non-obstructive cad larger sample multicenter research needed reduce bias third due unavailability data specific cause death clinical endpoint mace defined all-cause mortality myocardial infraction
