risk protective factor nosocomial infection relatively large cohort elderly patient hospitalized tertiary neurology clinic italy prevalence hcai significantly higher cohort reported previously published epidemiological study performed different geographic area instance large study made netherlands 2007–2008 global prevalence hcai two previous study performed italy resulted 4.9 respectively recent survey based global data european union 6.5 cohort number nosocomial infections/number hospitalization ratio difference may explained different typology subject included investigation respect patient included above-mentioned study focused heterogenous hospital setting geriatric neurological setting interpretation correct discrepancy data data taken literature might suggest prevalence nosocomial infection among elderly patient tendentially higher among young subject previously reported elderly patient neurological disease could particularly susceptible hcai possible explanation discrepancy major duration hospitalization cohort median day 7–17 related specific category patient included present study geriatric patient often disabling neurological disease compared average length stay hospital italy european country duration hospitalization prevalence nosocomial infection indeed synergistically interrelated since higher length stay hospital obviously associated increased risk nosocomial infection nosocomial infection turn generally increase duration hospitalization investigation confirmed role medical device important risk factor hcai among elderly people specifically expected multivariable sensitivity analysis showed nasogastric tube urinary catheter vascular catheter strong risk factor healthcare-acquired pneumonia urinary infection bloodstream infection respectively result surprising strict accordance scientific literature topic among elderly patient included cohort older age resulted associated slight statistically significant higher rate nosocomial infection globally considered healthcare-acquired pneumonia urinary infection result found univariate different model multivariable analysis confirmed sensitivity analysis people without dementia thus appearing sufficiently robust study find statistically significant association dementia risk nosocomial infection trend regard however first model multivariable analysis effect dementia risk hcai nearly reached statistical significance 0.055 detail study showed clear association dementia pneumonia relationship found dementia urinary tract-infections link dementia higher rate healthcare-acquired pneumonia found study largely supported literature association probably driven increased rate aspiration pneumonia among patient dementia compared subject without difference turn may probably due higher rate dysphagia subject major neurocognitive disorder compared cognitively healthy subject patient mild cognitive impairment however able verify correctness interpretation due lack data needed make precise classification pneumonia case registered study respect possible relationship dementia nosocomial urinary treat infection geriatric setting still quite controversial matter scientific literature fact knowledge one hand majority study supported link two condition hand large investigation specifically focused geriatric patient denied association even reporting paradoxical protective effect dementia regard probably due greater difficulty patient major neurocognitive disorder explaining urinary disturbance compared cognitively healthy older subject study find association dementia nosocomial urinary tract infection regard important underline many nondemented patient hospitalized neurology clinic compared subject without neurological disease may higher risk urinary tract infection due several predisposing condition neurogenic bladder therefore possible hypothesize absence significant effect dementia nosocomial urinary tract infection study might caused least part particularly high prevalence kind infection neurological patient without dementia compared prevalence reported study specifically focused neurological setting present research supported strong effect stroke risk nosocomial infection globally considered healthcare-acquired pneumonia nosocomial urinary tract infection among geriatric patient neurological disorder indeed according multivariable analysis stroke almost doubled risk hcai cohort specifically patient stroke involved present study developed least one nosocomial infection hospitalization affected nosocomial urinary tract infection healthcare-acquired pneumonia data good agreement meta-analysis published focused prevalence infection stroke many mechanism could explain link stroke infection first many patient stroke developed dysphagia turn strong risk factor pneumonia secondly bladder dysfunction i.e. urinary incontinence retention well-known risk factor urinary tract infection frequent stroke occurring patient finally growing body evidence pre-clinical clinical study supported occurrence significant systemic immunodepression stroke consequent increase susceptibility infection according sensitivity analysis impact stroke risk infection relevant people without dementia among people affected major neurocognitive disorder seems greater extent mainly respect risk nosocomial pneumonia finding suggests dementia stroke produce synergistic effect risk kind infection probably due higher neurological deterioration stroke demented patient compared non-demented subject suggested recent multicenter study turn may explain higher rate dysphagia stroke patient dementia compared stroke patient without dementia consequently different rate nosocomial pneumonia two group synergistic effect stroke dementia also indirectly supported model including patient without overlapping diagnosis model indeed identify dementia statistically significant risk factor healthcare acquired pneumonia nosocomial infection globally considered patient without comorbidities probably setting dementia per doe relevantly increase risk subject without overlapping diagnosis act mostly adding risk factor patient predisposing medical condition first stroke study also shown significant impact sex determining risk nosocomial urinary tract infection pneumonia detail according multivariable analysis male sex resulted protective factor urinary tract infection risk factor nosocomial pneumonia data agreement previous study indeed hospital-acquired pneumonia seems common men male sex reported risk factor aspiration pneumonia older patient moreover urinary tract infection frequent woman men general point view find significant effect male sex respect risk nosocomial infection globally considered finding coherent scientific literature according male susceptible bacterial infection globally considered opinion discrepancy could explained taking account two factor study investigate possible kind bacterial infection pneumonia urinary tract infection bloodstream infection instance include final analysis gastrointestinal infection typically frequent men setting urinary tract infection typically frequent woman resulted frequent pneumonia nosocomial pneumonia case prevalent men generally reported frequent nosocomial urinary tract infection reason absence effect male sex risk nosocomial infection found study appears generalizable according sensitivity analysis male sex resulted significant risk factor pneumonia patient without dementia protective factor urinary infection patient dementia latter finding quite surprising need briefly analyzed regard exclude different impact male sex risk urinary tract infection among patient without dementia found study could caused presence confounding factor instance casual different incidence benign prostatic hypertrophy bph two group regard difficult measure potential impact confounding factor bph prevalence greatly underestimated general population furthermore important underline study male subject without dementia urinary dysfunction due neurogenic bladder therefore high risk urinary tract infection probably overrepresented compared general older population thus potentially masking gender effect kind infection considering factor result sensitivity analysis impact male sex urinary tract infection interpreted great caution mainly view generalization present study also investigated impact diabetes healthcare-acquired infection according multivariable analysis find effect diabetes risk nosocomial urinary tract infection result already reported another study agreement majority paper topic summarized recent meta-analysis discrepancy may explained considering specific setting present study tertiary neurology clinic specialized managing geriatric patient context different confounding factor including particularly high representation patient neurogenic bladder due several condition diabetes instance parkinsonian syndrome myelopathy may probably mask effect diabetes risk kind infection present investigation also showed protective effect diabetes respect risk nosocomial pneumonia result proved statistically significant according different model multivariable analysis according sensitivity analysis therefore robustness considered absolute general different review meta-analysis find association diabetes hospital-acquired pneumonia study reported diabetes mellitus protective factor acute respiratory distress syndrome ards probably due lowering effect cytokine storm produced diabetes context furthermore recent pre-clinical study suggests potential protective effect metformin used oral antidiabetic drug severe form pneumonia due streptococcus pneumoniae taken together above-mentioned finding might furnish possible interpretative key negative association diabetes mellitus incidence nosocomial pneumonia found study probably cohort diabetes mellitus protective effect moderate-severe form pneumonia likely frequently diagnosed indeed probable mild form pneumonia sometimes diagnosed due suboptimal sensitivity radiological investigation setting frequent use bedside chest radiography mainly patient hospitalized stroke unit topic also result taken model including patient without overlapping diagnosis interesting see supplementary material model diabetes result protective factor healthcare acquired pneumonia finding suggests diabetes might protective patient predisposing condition healthcare-acquired pneumonia first stroke probably per doe significantly modify risk kind nosocomial infection summary based data reasonably exclude diabetes mellitus risk factor nosocomial pneumonia geriatric neurological setting state certainty protective factor pneumonia regardless severity univariate analysis showed use antipsychotic drug risk factor nosocomial infection globally considered bloodstream infection however utilizing different model multivariable analysis
