introduction nosocomial infection often known hospital acquired infection infection patient contract treated hospital infection occur healthcare delivery disease well patient discharged also include occupational infection among medical personnel invasive device used modern health care catheter ventilator linked infection increase infection increase hospitalization long-term disability antimicrobial resistance socioeconomic disruption mortality rate due inadequate surveillance system lack control method little information burden nosocomial infection significant patient undergoing treatment medical condition high likelihood contracting respiratory infection complicate accurate assessment prevalence nosocomial infection within primary care facility despite improvement knowledge ability control illness nevertheless pose serious threat global public health even best clinical care useless patient contract additional infection treated hospital nosocomial infection occur stay longer leading use 48-h criterion several epidemiological surveillance system microorganism streptococcus spp. acinetobacter spp. enterococci pseudomonas aeruginosa coagulase negative staphylococci staphylococcus aureus bacillus cereus legionella member enterobacteria family among organism frequently involved nosocomial infection microorganism spread person person via shared object surface environment contaminated water food diseased people contaminated healthcare worker skin infection may come outside environment another sick patient potentially infected employee sometimes microorganism come patient skin microbiota becomes opportunistic result surgery treatment undermine skin barrier defence even though patient may acquired illness skin still regarded nosocomial arises medical facility nosocomial infection affect large number patient worldwide significantly increasing mortality rate financial loss world health organization estimate year hundred million patient experience nosocomial infection major source illness mortality however reliable data source available occurrence nosocomial infection globally according estimate approximately hospitalized patient infection nosocomial infection account 4–56 neonatal death incidence rate south-east asia sub-saharan africa high-income country incidence range 3.5 whereas range 5.7 19.1 middle- low-income country also developed world prevalence reported among hospitalized patient high among patient admitted intensive care unit prevalence nosocomial infection africa relatively high available data limited prevalence nosocomial infection africa estimated 12.2 confidence interval 9.8–14.8 systematic review meta-analysis study carried similar finding reported nigeria infection leading cause morbidity mortality among hospitalized patient lead higher healthcare cost longer hospital stay meta-analysis study conducted nigeria revealed overall prevalence nosocomial infection country 20.2 surgical site infection urinary tract infection bloodstream infection common type infection reported nosocomial infection prevalent nigeria due variety factor including poor infection prevention control practice insufficient resource lack awareness poor perception poor knowledge among healthcare worker patient furthermore overuse antibiotic nigeria resulted emergence antibiotic-resistant bacteria complicate management nosocomial infection even according efstathiou al. one primary reason high incidence nosocomial infection hospital setting lack knowledge awareness among patient patient well-informed knowledgeable risk prevention nosocomial infection likely take precaution reduction nosocomial infection global priority number approach suggested including use infection prevention control measure prudent antibiotic use encouragement patient education engagement due lack knowledge awareness patient may engage behaviour increase risk nosocomial infection furthermore patient perception nosocomial infection well attitude toward infection prevention control impact prevalence infection study teaching hospital nigeria example discovered patient perception cleanliness hospital environment quality care received significant predictor willingness comply infection prevention control measure understanding patient knowledge perception nosocomial infection therefore critical developing effective strategy reduce occurrence study knowledge perception nosocomial infection mostly done among health care professional globally nigeria limited study assessment knowledge perception nosocomial infection among patient nigeria study knowledge perception nosocomial infection among patient nigerian tertiary hospital critical improving patient outcome lowering country burden healthcare-associated infection assessing patient knowledge perception nosocomial infection tertiary hospital vital several reason empowers patient better education ensuring understand actively participate infection prevention measure informed patient likely follow hygiene protocol reducing spread infection within hospital benefiting patient healthcare staff study also contributes improved healthcare quality patient safety identifying area concern warranting intervention additionally hold financial implication prevention nosocomial infection lead cost saving healthcare facility shortened hospital stay decreased readmission result inform research policy development initiative enhance quality ultimately creating safer patient-focused healthcare environment tertiary hospital

higher healthcare cost longer hospital stay prevalence nosocomial infection reported result poor knowledge perception patient patient identified various mode transmission nosocomial infection airborne dirty bed unsterilized equipment improper wound dressing slightly different finding khan colleague stated nosocomial infection spread person person via shared object surface environment contaminated water food diseased people contaminated healthcare worker skin simply illustrates ubiquity infection ease spread study majority patient showed fair poor knowledge nosocomial infection contrast finding study carried ocran tagoe knowledge shown patient deemed adequate could due participant completed primary secondary education need improve knowledge patient regarding nosocomial infection study also recorded higher average knowledge among male patient female patient higher knowledge among male patient study could due higher tendency male come nosocomial infection female contrast finding rahiman female higher knowledge score male although study carried among nursing student finding study also revealed patient higher education also displayed better knowledge nosocomial infection lower level education show importance proper education knowledge nosocomial infection thus hospital associated infection may decline result increased knowledge hospital associated infection adherence preventative measure higher education level may positively influence patient health education ability pay attention understand educational material higher level knowledge shown among participant higher age study similar finding study carried ethiopia ghana older age associated higher knowledge among study participant although population two study healthcare worker often receive specialised training nosocomial infection possible reason high level knowledge shown older patient study could risk nosocomial infection several study reported significant relationship increasing age risk developing nosocomial infection lower mean knowledge score also reported among patient aged 18–28 year thus intervention form education awareness campaign carried targeted towards younger patient patient married higher knowledge score single tandem finding study ethiopia married participant higher likelihood better knowledge nosocomial infection single could due fact married people tend better health seeking behaviour marital status positive influence health-seeking behaviour although impact marriage health-seeking behavior highly individual influenced various factor patient perception nosocomial infection additionally majority patient showed negative perception towards nosocomial infection observed study contrast study smyth india jeyasheelan colleague reported participant showed high perception towards nosocomial infection significant association age perception towards nosocomial infection study patient whose age year positive perception nosocomial infection year could due higher prevalence nosocomial infection among patient older age group intervention nosocomial infection targeted towards patient older population help improve perception furthermore study also revealed making alcohol rub restricting patient movement ward ward use control measure hand hygiene bring decrease nosocomial infection similar finding smyth use alcohol-based hand rub visitor stopping movement patient ward ward restricting number visitor suggested measure patient practical implication study finding study participant showed fair knowledge nosocomial infection coupled negative perception could far-reaching implication healthcare policy patient education healthcare policy customized specifically address concern emphasizing need improved infection prevention measure stringent regulatory standard policy may also establish patient right related infection control healthcare provider responsibility educate patient infection risk patient education program need tailored dispel misconception alleviate negative perception clear accurate information provided empowering patient actively engage care infection prevention furthermore improved communication strategy feedback mechanism transparency initiative essential rebuilding trust addressing patient concern limitation study carried one centre/hospital finding might generalizable health institution nigeria however finding study provide information state knowledge perception patient towards nosocomial infection could serve background platform future study also patient knowledge perception analysed based patient ward could provided information state knowledge patient nosocomial infection conclusion study showed patient fair knowledge well negative perception towards nosocomial infection also certain factor assessed potential influence patient knowledge perception towards nosocomial infection age influence patient perception knowledge nosocomial infection need educational intervention awareness targeted towards certain age group improve knowledge perception patient towards nosocomial infection
