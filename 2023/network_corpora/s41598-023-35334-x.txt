introduction computed tomography widely used diagnose cancer intravenous iodinated contrast medium icm essential detection diagnosis residual recurrent gastric cancer distant metastasis despite consensus necessity diagnosis ongoing debate regarding effect contrast medium exposure renal function study argued negative impact contrast medium renal function may overstated even case repetitive
