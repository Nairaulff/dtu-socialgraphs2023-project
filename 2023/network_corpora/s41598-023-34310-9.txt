introduction data collection one crucial aspect research project determine success failure lack quality data sometimes noted collection phase order avoid essential implement reliable data capture system addition employing trained data collector additionally success clinical research directly depends correct definition research protocol data collection strategy data management plan element drive quality reliability collected data used analyze outcome given study adopting new method tool data source changed research conducted however new challenge arisen demanding innovative approach collecting managing publishing data well-managed data easier use analyze confirm research hypothesis also reuse data study enhanced word stimulates research collaboration maximizes funders investment electronic data capture edc system valuable tool clinical trial research capture data offer improved data integrity cost saving shorter time study database closure may help researcher comply medical regulation enhance data quality researcher management capability preferably edc system also interoperable communicate system promote seamless data exchange integration research electronic data capture redcap kobotoolbox two well-known edc system first one present better approach whole research life cycle significant disadvantage usability issue inability working offline without additional software second one delivers user-friendly interface natively work offline mobile browser limited feature data management moreover health research researcher must work different environment ranging facility high-tech device limited access resource poor internet connection lack reliable electrical power case tuberculosis infectious neglected disease resource research may lacking cost using edc could limitation scenario aggravated fact brazil among top country highest burden aspect stand barrier collecting data research therefore making data available data-driven study crucial underpinning development new evidence-based decision-making tool integrating information extensive system hampered data format structural heterogeneity data must correctly described order beneficial thus semantic interoperability critical consideration information system design achieved one system understand context meaning information provided another system meaning imparted data using ontology semantic standard i.e. well-defined vocabulary allow precise machine-readable description domain-specific knowledge may enable semantic interoperability allowing system interpret data accordance formal definition sense data shared accurately reliably enhance communication among computerized system capability especially desirable health information system due heterogeneity medical language health-related concept ontology essential semantic alignment data integration information exchange semantic interoperability ontology comprises several property describing specific piece data domain
