introduction decreasing muscle strength muscle mass recently received increasing attention rosenberg first reported sarcopenia defined loss muscle strength muscle mass due aging reported sarcopenia induced high risk mortality incident disability additionally sarcopenia showed significant financial burden medical expense sarcopenia amounting approximately 18.5 billion contrast dynapenia condition maintained muscle mass reduced muscle strength also attracted attention also reported dynapenia highly associated mortality physical disfuction similar sarcopenia moreover reported muscle quality strength rather muscle mass important clinical finding including mortality risk physical performance therefore pay attention muscle strength well muscle mass treating patient musculoskeletal disorder spinal disease regarding muscle patient spinal disease prevalence sarcopenia higher patient spinal canal stenosis compared normal subject addition prevalence sarcopenia higher patient spinal deformity spinal stenosis regarding clinical finding patient spinal disease sarcopenia showed poor lbp score outcome surgery however report evaluated spinal alignment clinical finding spinal disease dynapenia determining whether muscle mass muscle strength important would helpful treating patient spinal disease however remains unclear particular report focused difference muscle mass muscle strength factor affecting clinical finding including spinal alignment low back pain elderly therefore hypothesized decreased muscle mass muscle strength affect clinical finding spinal alignment body composition testing hypothesis purpose current study elucidate prevalence sarcopenia dynapenia evaluate whether muscle mass muscle strength affect clinical outcome low back pain lbp spinal sagittal alignment

full size table discussion study incidence rate pre-sarcopenia dynapenia sarcopenia 9.7 19.2 8.8 respectively indicating 37.6 elderly patient spinal disease showed decreased muscle mass muscle strength additionally age significantly higher compared several author reported decreased muscle strength mass highly related ageing elderly patient additionally muscle strength decline rapid muscle mass decline petermann-rocha reported systematic review incidence sarcopenia varied subject cut-off point classification different among study finding indicated unexpectedly many patient spinal disease decreased muscle mass strength addition ageing may risk factor loss muscle strength mass regarding spinal alignment current study group decreased muscle strength pre-sarcopenia group showing decreased muscle mass showed change spinal sagittal alignment compared normal addition several spinal sagittal alignment parameter including pi-ll sva significantly correlated grip strength smi several author reported decreased appendicular skeletal muscle mass related spinal sagittal malalignment spinal disease patient addition previous report showed low trunk muscle mass grip strength might risk factor spinal malalignment spinal disease patient thus muscle strength well muscle mass associated spinal sagittal alignment however report elucidate muscle mass strength strongly associated spinal alignment kudo reported back extensor muscle strength quality appendicular skeletal muscle mass related spinal sagittal alignment elderly patient based finding current study previous report muscle strength rather appendicular skeletal muscle mass might strongly associated spinal sagittal alignment lbp score hrqol score similar result spinal alignment group showed decreased muscle strength pre-sarcopenia group deteriorated lbp score including odi lbp eq5d score normal odi eq5d also significantly correlated grip strength smi spinal alignment may strongly associated clinical finding matsuyama stated review patient spinal sagittal malalignment usually various disability due lbp addition several spinal sagittal alignment parameter reported strongly associated hrqol score another previous report patient osteoporosis spinal sagittal malalignment showed deteriorated lbp score moreover reported improving spinal sagittal alignment corrective surgery improved hrqol score finding previous report indicated decreasing muscle strength well muscle mass associated change spinal sagittal alignment leading low back pain however report demonstrate muscle strength muscle mass would important low back pain cobmined finding present study suggested decreasing muscle strength loss muscle mass might cause deterioration clinical finding including lbp hrqol via deterioration spinal alignment study patient dynapenia group decreased muscle strength significantly lower trunk muscle mass patient normal group although appendicular skeletal muscle mass preserved thus trunk muscle mass rather appendicular skeletal muscle mass may important especially spinal disease patient yamamoto reported low trunk muscle mass related hyperkyphosis appendicular skeletal muscle mass previous report indicated trunk muscle mass significantly related spinal alignment odi score eq5d score adjusted appendicular skeletal muscle mass furthermore decreased trunk muscle mass might possible risk factor lbp osteoporosis patient thus trunk muscle might important factor maintaining posture improving clinical finding considered treating patient spinal disease finding current study muscle strength trunk muscle mass rather appendicular skeletal muscle mass might affect spinal sagittal alignment lbp hrqol clinical relevance several author reported even muscle mass lost mortality increased muscle strength maintained addition reported exercise therapy positive effect muscle strength insufficient evidence muscle mass therefore exercise therapy muscle strength may important treating patient spinal disease limitation current study first study cross-sectional study unclear whether muscle strength affect spinal alignment clinical finding whether spinal alignment clinical finding affect muscle strength longitudinal study needed future evaluate aspect second factor vertebral fracture may related body composition spinal sagittal alignment nevertheless evaluate vertebral fracture study thus measurement including bmi smi tmi might overestimated patient vertebral fracture body height might underestimated patient however method correct body composition remains unclear therefore muscle mass compared without body height correction longitudinal study conducted future third concerned accuracy measurement trunk muscle mass using bia included visceral cardiac muscle however spinal alignment parameter low back pain score associated trunk muscle mass measured bia skeletal muscle mass patient spinal disease therefore measurement trunk muscle mass using bia worth evaluating especially study patient spinal disease fourth measure trunk muscle strength discrepancy may exist tendency grip strength trunk muscle strength measuring trunk muscle strength well grip strength may important evaluating spinal sagittal alignment lbp especially patient spinal disease study needed conclusion current study showed approximately patient spinal disorder dynapenia sarcopenia respectively addition patient low muscle strength low trunk muscle mass poor outcome lbp poor hrqol change spinal sagittal alignment elderly patient low appendicular skeletal muscle mass alone thus intervention muscle strength may treatment option change spinal sagittal alignment lbp
