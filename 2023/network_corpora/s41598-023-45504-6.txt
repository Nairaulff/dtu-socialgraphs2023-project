significant positive effect used protocol compliance retainer wear six month observed line result previous literature show improvement information retention however overall compliance still suboptimal could due nature hawley retainer affect appearance speech multi-faceted factor affect compliance previous literature applicability significant improvement gained knowledge using digitized method doe affect compliance level may relate fact study done short term period similar result noticed study significant effect extended follow time could demonstrate reminder effective long term comparison shorter period observance moreover patient could affected hawthorne effect two different way first way observance clinician constant weekly reminder message awareness presence microsensors delivered

health maintenance comparison retention phase participant experience similar group except satisfaction way delivering instruction favorably perceived audiovisual group recorded via questionnaire administered questionnaire developed depending perspective national health service depend question reflect patient satisfaction hawley retainer impact clinical method communication result questionnaire given participant month observation reflect perspective period retention result demonstrate benefit multimodal approach delivering clear information comparison usual method participant underestimated wearing time contrary previous literature shown general overestimation wearing hour may explained fact participant knew monitored interestingly participant expressed stress monitored control group may relate importance way delivering information moreover majority participant reported comfortable retainer first week feeling stressed choice retainer type retention protocol still debatable literature practice hawley retainer still preferred known advantage occlusal settling capacity incorporated modification simple teeth movement retention however often associated temporary speech change desirable aesthetic due metal labial bow trial aimed reflect aligns traditionally known clinical practice moreover microsensor failure higher vacuum-formed retainer comparison hawley retainer would complicate long term follow compliance monitoring patient receiving vacuum-formed retention effective communication compliance integral part successful treatment understanding effective way delivering information help establishment effective rapport clinician information provision process must ensure patient receives understands retains information long period use multimodal approach mixing auditory visual sens help retain information longer duration contrary use single method communication verbal written visual shown non-significant effect retention information patient family multi-faceted nature information retention depends positive expressive reaction result relaxing behavior full capacity concentration aligns result show significant improvement participant knowledge using audiovisual information instructional video additionally mobile application reminder digitized method communication monitoring recently accelerated transformation toward use digital information communication technology could help monitoring analyzing large data patient behavior factor affecting compliance digitized method helped cope upcoming challenge orthodontic field recent year development innovative method aid exploring alternative way modeling patient behavior instance utilization new mean retain information providing audiovisual illustration enhance information retention furthermore use sensor-based technology paved way future modification could integrate interactive thermal wearable sensor depending personalized monitored data would guide process precisely limitation microsensors shown substantial accuracy in-vitro study clinically record actual time palatal surface 1.2 patient informed presence recording microsensors may influence wear behavior technical problem occurred one participant reading microsensor month leading loss data follow reflection compliance full-time basis 6-month period high-quality research needed reflect longer duration compliance part-time wear hawley retainer used might preferable patient thus discourage overall participant compliance comparison option patient sub-optimal compliance retainer wear still managed fit retainer end observation period realization wearing retainer right time i.e. observing no-to-minimal change dentition despite issued instruction could one reason behind decision observation supported recent evidence suggesting reduced wear time removable appliance sufficient achieve good outcome conclusion audiovisual instruction combined weekly reminder message seem significant effect improving compliance removable hawley retainer wear nonetheless periodontal health change significantly audiovisual instruction implemented participant experience similar except satisfaction way delivering instruction favorably reported audiovisual group
