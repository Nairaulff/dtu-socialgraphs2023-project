introduction gastrointestinal tract host complex microbial community bacteria archaea eukarya collectively known gut microbiota influence balance health onset intestinal extra intestinal disease recent year become increasingly clear gut microbiome involved gut-brain signalling leading emergence gut microbiota-brain axis concept mounting preclinical evidence broadly suggests gut microbiota modulate brain development function behaviour immune metabolic neuronal pathway dysbiosis pathway dysregulated associated altered permeability blood–brain barrier bbb neuroinflammation structure function gut microbiota varies along tract also lumen mucosa colon mucus covering epithelium critical gut homeostasis harbouring microbial community safe distance epithelium surface intestinal mucin -glycans main structural component mucus provide binding site sustainable source nutrient bacteria inhabiting mucus niche therefore contributing spatial organisation gut microbiota mucin -glycosylation initiated addition -acetylgalactosamine galnac residue hydroxyl group serine threonine resulting formation antigen represents substrate addition sugar glycosyltransferases addition galactose gal antigen result formation core galβ1-3galnacα-ser/thr whereas addition -acetylglucosamine glcnac antigen result core glcnac-β1-3galnacα-ser/thr structure extension core core glcnac residue action β1,6 -acetylglucosaminyltransferase give rise core galβ1,3 glcnacβ1,6 galnacα1-ser/thr core glcnacβ1,6 glcnacβ1,3 galnacαser/thr structure respectively distribution mucin core structure varies along tract partly due organ-specific expression pattern core glycosyltransferases core structure typical gastric duodenal mucin whereas core core abundant colonic mucin homeostatic condition mucin core structure elongated addition monosaccharide mucin glycan chain usually terminated sulfate sialic acid fucose residue resulting highly diverse oligosaccharide structure modification mucin
