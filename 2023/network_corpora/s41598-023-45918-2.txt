introduction globally nearly billion pesticide used every year budget roughly billion usd according thailand ministry agriculture cooperative approximately 136,140 ton agrochemical substance imported herbicide largest importation 54.51 followed insecticide 21.71 fungicide 17.81 although herbicide seem indispensable part agricultural process global interest indiscriminate use agrochemicals human health public concern consequently many country around world regulation policy place restrict ban herbicide today including paraquat glyphosate prohibited country due high toxicity association suicide since european union enforced ban paraquat usa restricted licensed applicator international agency research cancer categorized glyphosate human carcinogenic risk conversely u.s. national cancer
