evaluate red blood cell deformability index also rbc aggregation parameter interestingly found time required half maximal change aggregation signal 1/2 rbc significantly lower among patient treated health resort sulfur water bath comparable previous study among triathlon subject factor affecting formation red blood cell aggregate may divided two group first group consists external factor includes level plasma protein fibrinogen lipo-proteins macroglobulins immunoglobulin shear force hematocrit second group consists internal factor shape erythrocyte deformability property cell membrane moreover patient treated health resort significantly lower result extent red blood cell aggregation described aggregation index similarly deformability aggregation red blood cell important impact main function—transportation however lower aggregation index better higher 1/2 better well find significant difference red blood cell count study group similar result found galvez according baskurt rheological property blood mainly result property red blood cell strongly modify blood flow blood vessel also property plasma including protein contained presence high molecular weight protein fibrinogen lipoprotein globulin especially α2-macroglobulin immunoglobulin increase plasma viscosity thus increase blood viscosity found level white blood cell wbc significantly lowered among patient osteoarthritis treated health resort speaking granulocyte type wbc biggest difference seen neutrophile number also significantly decreased result may suggest treatment sulfur water health resort positive impact chronic low-grade inflammation process presented however observe significant difference high sensitive c-reactive protein concentration result opposition presented olah crp significantly decreased nevertheless second blood specimen collection time different study week versus month accordingly case rheological property blood depend fibrinogen lower level affect initiation red blood cell aggregation lead increased blood viscosity fibrinogen kda glycoprotein synthesized liver plasma concentration approximately 150–400 mg/dl protein involved blood coagulation hemostasis also involved inflammation tissue repair process fibrinogen facilitates platelet aggregation binding glycoprotein iib/iiia receptor forming fibrin monomer rapidly polymerizes form clot according sen plasma fibrinogen level increase 3-times inflammatory response cause cell aggregation increase blood viscosity rheological property blood depend large extent fibrinogen concentration elevated level lead increased red blood cell aggregation result increased blood viscosity however found statistically significant difference analyzed group fibrinogen level coagulation parameter moreover found mean hemoglobin level among patient treated health resort significantly decreased week may relative due increased thirstiness bathing sulfide water induces overhydration abovementioned situation result fluctuation blood pressure depending speed reaction adaptive capacity human body heart rate may also alter limitation study limitation firstly control group smaller intervention one however statistically significant difference group sex ratio age baseline parameter furthermore study design prospective secondly performed measurement baseline 3-week time reflects course sulfur balneotherapy average rbc lifespan normal individual day thus taking account effect red blood cell hemorheological property probably even underestimated thirdly along laboratory parameter functional
