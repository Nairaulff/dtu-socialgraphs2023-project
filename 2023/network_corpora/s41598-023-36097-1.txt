embryo implantation tsh could significantly stimulate expression lif endometrial cell culture indicated involvement tsh lif signaling regulation embryo implantation limitation study thyroid antibody missed study addressed impaired reproductive outcome euthyroid woman thyroid antibody prospective study euthyroid woman low-normal high-normal tsh level included may lead selection bias potentially limit reliability result however also believed restricting population based presence thyroid antibody may generalize result patient serum estrogen tbg level missed oocyte pick-up estrogen level decreased significantly tbg level supposed changed accordingly however woman pregnant post estrogen tbg level changed response pregnancy without data whether impaced d14 tsh level could fully understood although sample size relatively large perform sample size calculation consequence power study partially reduced besides due limited number woman transferred cleavage embryo blastocyst subgroup analysis based stage transferred embryo seemed unreliable included woman using gnrh-a ovarian stimulation protocol general patient characteristic estrogen level may significantly different mild ovarian stimulation protocol consequence result might applied fixed population although demonstrated association d14 tsh level clinical pregnancy rate live birth rate causal relationship could drawn whether treatment could improve relative low clinical pregnancy live birth rate d14 tsh level threshold investigated strength study listed follows included patient homogeneous possible due uniform protocol added reliability study linear association d14 tsh level above-mentioned reproductive outcome firstly reported result suggested using uniform reference range 4.0 miu/l assessment thyroid function appropriate result also first time showed little impact high d14 tsh level obstetric outcome suggested d14 tsh level would soon declined normal trimester-specific range conclusion elevated d14 tsh level associated better clinical pregnancy live birth rate associated worse obstetric outcome mechanism explain phenomenon remained studied
