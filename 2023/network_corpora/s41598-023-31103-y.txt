introduction dark adaptation describes recovery visual sensitivity dark light exposure multiple process occur simultaneously allow retinal homeostasis including modulation blood flow interphotoreceptor matrix protein photoreceptor signaling protein redistribution metabolic energy flow reversal visual perception dark rod-mediated affected rod photoreceptor health homeostasis delayed dark adaptation often early symptom various retinal disease including retinitis pigmentosa diabetic retinopathy age-related macular degeneration deeper understanding dark adaptation well early clinical detection therefore essential prevent irreversible vision loss subject previous animal study established dark adaptation induces outer retinal structural change related maintaining retinal homeostasis concordant study focused human subject shown similar result mostly diseased retina i.e diabetic retinopathy macular disease etc considerably fewer study however performed healthy human

dark adaptation period longest overnight dark adaptation lack change could due several factor including homeostatic process given nature homeostasis possible photoreceptor dark current cause increased adenosine triphosphate atp consumption dark adaptation maintained prolonged period time eye already acclimated dark eye already fully adjusted new light setting continued need adjust retinal atp consumption return baseline level furthermore dark adaptation known slow age given study participant almost exclusively young healthy adult dark adaptation expected faster therefore possible

incredibly quickly dark adaptation dark adaptation recovery time human however yet established oct study lack structural change result necessitates study establish longest dark adaptation period structural change however mouse study like al. threaten refute possibility quick dark adaptation recovery time setting homeostatic process overnight dark adaptation study yielded structural change well longer dark adaptation period also scale several hour prolonged dark adaptation may well cause structural change change may due confounding variable namely diurnal rhythm disc shedding photoreceptors renewed transient loss subsequent replacement outer segment thus leading time temporary outer segment shortening disc shedding linked circadian cycle active period shedding early morning least late evening therefore associated retinal thinning shortening seen overnight period may attributable confounding variable rather dark adaptation another potential variable may account
