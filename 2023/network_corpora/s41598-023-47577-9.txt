3.1 based experience virtual reality procedure modified continue used people cognitive impairment 3.2 health staff individual agreed suggesting change type hmd going model lighter wearable people higher cognitive impairment would difficult understand reason wearing hmd may also elicit anxiety invasive hmd may likely help overcome difficulty suggestion consider exposing user perceive higher anxiety level wearing hmd greater difficulty understanding activity virtual setup doe require wear hmd e.g. cave automatic virtual environment participant agreed actively involve health staff deployment user make context even familiar another element consider future expand number virtual reality experience familiarize person equipment virtual context three health staff suggested creating

cognitive decline condition might decrease benefit provided intervention e.g. issue related understanding intervention aim difficulty expressing understanding activity really appreciated however reported important human factor consider inviting session related individual personality characteristic since observed two participants—despite critical level cognitive impairment—were calm positive exposure theme risk using virtual reality 5.1 based experience risk applying technology way done research 5.2 significant risk encountered eliciting intense emotion positive must contained even

e.g. table frequency related agreement/disagreement expressed health care staff participant main theme focus group full size table discussion core objective present study ass feasibility potential benefit exposure target older adult living long-term care general perspective feasibility acceptance proved satisfactory line previous research e.g. exposure apparatus well-tolerated severe notable adverse side effect nausea dizziness confusion reported frequently reported symptom wore apparatus five minute slight sensation fatigue eye discomfort limited period exposure hmd relevant note environment used study labeled static scenario slight visual oscillation e.g. seawater oscillation plant due action wind without rapid movement intentional design consideration given previous work reported static scene constant speed movement could prevent cybersickness symptom e.g. main difficulty referred nearly half participant patient healthcare staff weight wearability hmd issue previously reported instance kalantari study differs slightly older study e.g. model hmd used samsung gear weighed oculus quest used weighs even larger sample necessary consider result representative target population sample entirely composed older adult individual slender physique weak muscle mass undoubtedly contributes perception heaviness despite limitation perceived weight device participant significantly affect overall experience virtual context withdrawal study similar study e.g. participant expressed verbally manifested nonverbal behavior general state interest awareness engagement enjoyment exposure showing appreciation experience report collected intervention showed exposure realistic natural customized virtual environment adapted user preference need prompted reaction reminiscence melancholic memory aesthetic appreciation seeing sense safeness protection appreciated context interestingly given research context participant also expressed feeling self-realization useful providing opinion suggestion experimenter improve virtual scenario moreover participant stated would recommend friend confirming potential benefit experience user cognitive impairment general increased relaxation state reduction worry/anxiety post-vr self-reported observed consistent prior finding e.g. supporting hypothesis serve restorative stress-reducing experience set core construct emerged focus group conducted healthcare professional line data reported older adult participant involved study one healthcare staff perceived hmd difficult heavy older adult even corrective measure could taken improve comfort wearing hmd novel lightweight hmd might facilitate acceptance ease use especially fragile state second constraint related difficulty properly assessing patient experience case severe cognitive impairment case collection bio-physiological parameter could added part experimental procedure better ass experience patient triangulate different source information e.g. heart rate skin conductance etc. finally collection informed consent reported problematic—albeit necessary—task signing pen-and-paper form per well accepted older adult whilst approach collecting informed consent might suitable easy-to-deploy e.g. verbal consent however important add step essential deployment research project expected would impact implementation therapy program considering major perceived advantage using patient focus group participant highlighted possibility deploy environment patient able experience anymore e.g. seascape mountainscapes clinical and/or logistical issue given feedback provided staff focus group result patient participant using provide several recommendation inform future development improvement solution methodological viewpoint operational perspective operational perspective hmd proved generally acceptable lighter-weight hmd might improve usability particularly target group addition mitigate discomfort potential anxiety identifying customized time space could beneficial meet patient need instance certain time day e.g. sundown syndrome location unfamiliar room may trigger anxiety behaviour avoided necessary finally preparatory procedure include targeted careful assessment physical condition including hearing aid glass mobility device although current research major problem reported methodological perspective enriching experience additional audio video detail could improve impact intervention considering patient might familiar environment e.g. mountain scenery others thus paying attention wanting explore specific detail term customization option appeared appropriate viable target group fact core objective explore feasibility entire procedure including availability certain degree customization option could potentially neither viable acceptable context adding psycho-physiological measure e.g. heart rate variability skin conductance etc could greatly improve assessment anxiety/relaxation particularly patient severe cognitive impairment may challenge communicating important acknowledge participant anxiety level study may higher expected patient exposed first time unfamiliar room dedicated study additional methodological issue related participant sample inclusion criterion large majority study measure evaluate cognitive decline level e.g. mmse used reference e.g. study demonstrate individual range cognition able benefit even investigate personality trait based proper measured qualitative consideration reported observer focus group suggests personality trait might play role reinforcing efficacy intervention despite fact specifically measured study author might argue specific trait like willingness try new experience could reliable proxy potential success therefore characteristic considered perhaps weighted even cognitive ability future study properly ass impact role process another important outcome study highlighting potential customization term acceptance personal-adaptation refers ability tailor environment feature user preference e.g. removing personal trigger anxiety related peculiar visual auditory stimulus could characterize scenario efficacy adaptation implies opportunity facilitate stronger connection virtual context personal history narrative word linking virtual environment personal constructs/meanings could facilitate emergence viable sustainable therapeutic experience patient involved somewhere area elaboration even considering reminiscence emerge exposure may contribute decreasing anxiety limitation promising important underline several potential limitation may introduced bias present study given small sample size recruitment single long-term care facility generalizability result taken caution moreover even recent study evidence gender difference user experience presence usability gender-related difference still debated literature reason future study stratify sample control effect various socio-demographic variable gender additional bias could introduced subjective researcher observation lack triangulation self-reports objective measure biophysiological data author exclude increased level interaction e.g. combining metaverse game
