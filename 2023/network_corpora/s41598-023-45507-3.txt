introduction facial attractiveness play vital role social interaction example facial attractiveness involves positive bias toward mate choice education personality trait consequently numerous study conducted facial attractiveness factor experimental study shown average face obtained combining multiple face image rated attractive individual face image facial symmetry positively influence attractiveness rating furthermore face emphasize sexual dimorphism masculinity male face femininity female face higher attractiveness sexual dimorphism related morphological feature formed sex hormone female face estrogen suppresses bone growth resulting rounded cheek lip male face testosterone cause cheekbone chin develop brow muscle rise center face protrude forward length face cheek chin increase thus facial morphological feature facial averageness symmetry sexual dimorphism important factor facial attractiveness addition morphological feature facial contrast luminance skin condition smoothness blemish influence one perception facial attractiveness example gender difference facial luminance contrast female face deemed attractive increasing luminance difference eyes/mouth skin male face attractive decreasing luminance difference thus many facial attractiveness factor identified experimental method investigate facial feature based specific hypothesis however experimental method consider influence hypothesis enormous variation combination facial feature difficult examine facial feature comprehensively recent year data-driven approach computationally model relationship facial feature impression using many face stimulus widely used approach examine feature define facial impression minimal researcher bias recent year computer graphic modeling study geometric morphometrics

related morphological feature due action testosterone affect facial masculinity regarding eye heatmap result eye size also consistent finding eye important clue facial attractiveness difference activity value shape attractiveness large however high value shape attractiveness tended narrow heatmap area slightly suggesting morphological feature also contribute attractiveness prediction however overall fluctuation heatmap attractiveness rating large feature luminance contrast around eye eyebrow may important predictor attractiveness using deep learning luminance contrast eyes/mouth skin associated femininity masculinity sexual dimorphism influence attractiveness perception suggesting feature involved attractiveness prediction result showed greater heatmap around eye especially female image high attractiveness rating heatmap around eye female image consistent previous study result may also related influence luminance contrast psychological finding woman attractive increasing luminance contrast eyes/mouth skin eye area luminance contract common element asian white image racial difference case high attractiveness rating male image case middle low attractiveness rating female image model accuracy tested different race prediction accuracy lower race suggesting model may learned different characteristic depending race general discussion study showed large eye elongated nose sharp-angled contour raised eyebrow important feature attractiveness regardless gender eyebrow particularly pronounced male image study showed relationship facial shape attractiveness revealed geometric morphometrics corresponds actual attractiveness perception effect significant asian female asian male image study using grad-cam showed male image active around eye eyebrow chin higher attractiveness rating resulting greater heatmap addition higher value shape attractiveness slightly narrower heatmap area female image showed heatmap around area eye condition greater heatmap higher attractiveness rating consistent study eyebrow eye male image identified study elevated eyebrow associated attractiveness study higher attractiveness rating active eyebrow area higher value
