observed vivo/situ well vitro protection vivo/situ formed pellicle higher vitro formed one upon exposure enamel surface saliva electron-dense basal layer formed within granular layer form top basal layer basal layer contains pellicle precursor protein main acid resistant protein suggesting layer mainly responsible erosion protective property pellicle vitro pellicle generally thinner vivo/situ pellicle proteomics analysis shown contain precursor protein therefore likely composed mainly basal layer generally proteomic analysis vitro formed pellicle difficult since amount protein recovered

proteomic analysis comparing vitro situ vivo formed aeps revealed various difference difference found qualitative level well quantitative level different protein difference likely also lead difference

group without inhibitor difference protective effect vitro pellicle different formation time maximum protection reached already min used formation period commonly used period enable compare result earlier study protease inhibitor used mix chemical non-peptide inhibitor many protease inhibitor cocktail contain peptide inhibitor could interact integrated pellicle would alter pellicle peptide naturally occur pellicle could also lead effect property pellicle also included protocol exchanged saliva several time aep formation vitro pellicle might compared vivo pellicle suffer lack possibility replenish resupply degraded protein peptide rate saliva replenishment even factor influence inter-individual difference pellicle vivo without exchange saliva pellicle likely thinner contains fewer protein enough protein collected pellicle proteomics analysis type saliva result generally showed significantly better protection saliva exchanged aep formation fig car result support better protection exchanging saliva group calcium released corresponding group without exchange fig one important function pellicle maintain high calcium concentration close tooth surface prevent dissolution possibly vitro pellicle thicker saliva exchanged formation also trap calcium calcium-binding protein release bound calcium low calcium also released pellicle disintegrates erosion seemingly heightens calcium release measured protocol reality calcium released enamel surface likely group saliva exchanged since rsmh decreased significantly however effect observed adding protease inhibitor much greater one observed exchange saliva included protocol result clearly show erosion inhibiting effect vitro pellicle protease inhibitor added saliva explanation effect directly deduced one possible explanation could intact protein pellicle since proteolytic activity inhibited case difference vivo formed pellicle might even increased vitro formed pellicle already contain intact salivary protein vivo formed pellicle vivo formed pellicle contain many peptide fragment proteolysis original protein occur adsorption tooth mineral since binding hydroxyapatite protects pellicle protein cleavage found pellicle intact well cleaved form large part processing pellicle protein must happen saliva adsorption tooth surface protease inhibitor would prevent processing one keep mind saliva sample used vitro closed system oral environment open system constant resupply fresh protein clearance processed saliva closed system might overprocessing salivary protein especially incubation used pellicle formation resupply fresh protein another effect inhibitor could pellicle get thicker denser proteomics result inhibitor necessary collect enough material analysis would hint thicker pellicle car result hand suggest also qualitative difference explained thicker pellicle store calcium release upon erosion leading seemingly higher car ctrl group observed hs_exch group however result showed group containing inhibitor released significantly calcium ctrl group fig effect inhibitor enable pellicle get thicker one would expect even larger amount calcium stored pellicle released upon erosion would lead seemingly much higher calcium release opposite case also qualitative difference induced presence inhibitor possibility could pellicle denser sensitive acid attack consequently would release stored calcium would also limit diffusion acid surface dissolved mineral away surface explaining good protection observed parameter measured sri indirect measurement surface roughness pellicle layer cause certain smoothing roughness leading higher reflection intensity also observed pellicle removal ctrl group receive pellicle still similar rsri value pellicle removal fig real difference group surface roughness seen pellicle removal difference rather similar difference pellicle still present would mean pellicle similar smoothing effect surface difference visible pellicle removal already mainly stem difference surface roughness therefore assume ultra- structure different pellicle rather similar classical analysis method ass enamel demineralization chosen present study namely hardness calcium release surface reflection indirect measurement roughness one often used method measure surface loss erosive tooth wear profilometry performed since short erosion time used simulate early erosion lead limited surface loss high variation specimen method afm perfectly suited investigate surface property structure substrate pellicle help understand mechanism protection interaction pellicle substrate magnitude protective effect demineralization focus present study furthermore electron microscopy technique neutron reflectometry would helpful characterize ultrastructure pellicle observed dramatic effect inhibition protease method helpful investigate underlying reason effect although overall goal get closer vivo situ formed pellicle possible say whether pellicle formed closely resembled vivo pellicle direct functional comparison would necessary vitro pellicle inhibitor situ formed pellicle shed light closely resemble shortcoming present study hence situ pellicle group included study protocol important future study together investigation pellicle analysing e.g ultrastructure electron microscopy technique although would provide mainly qualitative information might help visualize explain difference pellicle protection enamel surface furthermore quantitative difference could analysed proteomic analysis although vitro pellicle already compared situ vivo pellicle proteomics method pellicle already formed protease inhibitor present comparison vitro pellicle formed classical way without inhibitor concerning saliva used pellicle formation protease effect property also collection processing investigating different collection processing protocol might also help identifying way achieve vitro pellicle resemble vivo pellicle closely present study showed dramatic difference protective property vitro pellicle formed saliva either without added protease inhibitor might important step toward developing vitro model saliva research closely resemble vivo condition
