endometrium compared control infertile patient detected woi displacement suggesting additional factor implantation failure beyond adjustment progesterone exposure indeed rif case additional endometrial-related factor likely contribute implantation failure along displaced disrupted woi like dysbiotic vaginal uterine microbiome evidence clinical effectiveness endometrial receptivity testing ivf pregnancy rate still controversial several study demonstrated significant increase implantation rate pet era win-test rsert test also proposed receptivity testing first embryo transfer increase implantation cumulative pregnancy rate pet compared conventional embryo transfer contrary report recent randomised controlled trial rct meta-analyses question effectiveness endometrial

pregnancy rate following pet another study haouzi demonstrated implantation rate increased three time using personalised woi determination ivf patient rif diagnosis despite generally supporting endometrial testing rif case study also stress low certainty evidence thus advocating continued research controversial topic one reason disparity study might actual rate recurrent implantation failure due endometrial factor may lower previously thought large-scale retrospective study involving nearly patient undergoing ivf preimplantation genetic testing aneuploidy pgt-a discovered around infertile patient failed achieve clinical pregnancy following three consecutive frozen euploid single embryo transfer embryonic maternal factor embryonal chromosomal aberration impaired endometrial receptivity maternal immune dysfunction infertility-associated disease like endometriosis male factor affect chance embryo implantation therefore due challenge related high heterogeneity study design group specific subgroup woman might benefit endometrial receptivity testing summary personalised endometrial dating likely increase chance implantation patient recurrent ivf failure time considered unnecessary add-on patient planning first ivf treatment however overall efficacy approach still largely unclear due disparity large-scale study transcriptomic test applied potential clinical utility endometrial receptivity testing also fully dependent upon consistency gene expression profile subsequent cycle following endometrial biopsy indeed claim approved seminal paper díaz-gimeno study author demonstrated reproducibility endometrial receptivity testing seven woman underwent era testing twice second endometrial biopsy obtained woman day menstrual cycle month first study cycle intercycle variation analysis showed total consistency era test diagnosis patient first second test therefore believed gene expression profile endometrial receptivity remains consistent time least subsequent couple month biopsy allowing embryo transfer time adjusted according endometrial receptivity test recommendation personalised embryo transfer would allow select time period peak endometrial receptivity embryo transfer however initial study involved seven patient question endometrial profile cycle-to-cycle consistency requires study moreover using endometrial tissue biopsy receptivity testing would exclude possibility embryo transfer cycle thereby prolonging ivf treatment considering possible cycle-to-cycle variation window implantation timing endometrial receptivity testing could benefit could analysed non-invasively cycle embryo planned transferred receptivity assessment uterine fluid would circumvent abovementioned problem uterine fluid aspiration done embryo transfer detrimental implantation rate recently provided proof rna biomarker-based minimally invasive endometrial receptivity testing using uterine fluid-derived extracellular vesicle applying beready endometrial testing model successfully determine receptivity status sample similar approach would open new possibility non-invasive endometrial receptivity testing may eliminate main shortcoming endometrial biopsy-based approach personalised embryo transfer limitation study also noted although set consisted sample clearly different expressional profile corresponding different menstrual cycle
