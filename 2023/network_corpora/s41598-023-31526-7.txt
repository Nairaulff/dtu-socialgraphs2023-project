introduction tobacco harm become one serious public health problem world today biggest preventable risk factor human health occurrence development diabetes stroke coronary heart disease malignant tumor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated tobacco dependence according incomplete statistic smoking cause one million death smoking-related disease china year tobacco epidemic brought huge burden social economic development increase medical expense decline productivity intensification poverty therefore tobacco control become urgent problem solved current society physical exercise play substitute role reward caused nicotine positive effect improving withdrawal intention reducing withdrawal symptom reducing tobacco craving although large number clinical experiment proved physical exercise effectively reduce cigarette craving tobacco addict relieve withdrawal symptom effectively improve success rate withdrawal currently relationship physical exercise smoking behavior china limited adolescent university student lack evidence association physical exercise smoking behavior chinese population whole therefore difficult provide sufficient research support government propose physical exercise assisted smoking cessation policy addition may gender difference cohort effect relationship physical exercise smoking behavior among chinese resident society highly tolerant men men stronger desire imitate smoking woman spend time unsupervised woman survey study also confirmed men smoke much higher rate woman similarly given woman physical mental limitation social image bias misconception role society numerous study shown woman likely men participate physical exercise addition relationship physical exercise smoking behavior among chinese resident complicated different context social change reason must consider issue cohort effect one hand different birth group different historical period difference social system economic level hand influence major social change different birth cohort group different stage life therefore affected differently cohort effect therefore important factor exploring evolution relationship physical exercise smoking behavior among chinese resident perspective social change life course based role physical exercise aiding smoking cessation lack evidence yet association physical exercise smoking behavior chinese resident study used china family panel study cfps cross-sectional dataset sample source analysis exploration based literature review study proposes three research hypothesis physical exercise negatively associated smoking risk chinese resident gender difference association physical exercise smoking risk among chinese resident physical exercise significantly associated smoking risk among male

physical exercise negatively associated smoking behavior among chinese resident aged year similar previous study neurobiological mechanism physical exercise reduces likelihood smoking population include following three aspect distraction according tiffany selective attention bias theory smoking behavior mainly controlled habit smoking behavior hindered smoker experience increase tobacco craving accompanied selective attention tobacco-related cue turn directs cognitive resource away ongoing task tobacco cue mechanism exercise intervention smoking cessation increase individual cognitive need reduce attention bias caused tobacco-related cue improve cognition long-term smoking lead reduced attention memory processing speed executive function atrophy hippocampus prefrontal cortex however exercise alter activation cognitive-related brain region dorsolateral prefrontal cortex anterior cingulate gyrus reducing cognitive impairment improving working memory inhibition ex-smokers thereby reducing tobacco dependence reward substitution long-term smoking cause abnormal release mesolimbic excitatory neurotransmitter dopamine leading dysfunction brain reward system turn make focused positive emotional experience brought tobacco exercise change release central neurotransmitter dopamine turn affect level central peripheral blood resulting substitute rewarding effect smoking gender difference relationship physical exercise smoking behavior among chinese resident aged year older physical exercise negatively associated smoking behavior among male resident association smoking behavior among female resident significant view low social acceptance female smoking behavior low smoking imitation desire risk-taking psychology high awareness health management number female smoker significantly male according global adult tobacco survey gat chinese male current smoker account 50.5 male population female current smoker account 2.1 female population similarly study also proved gender important influencing factor smoking behavior smoking probability male significantly greater female addition female participation exercise much lower male due physical psychological limitation misconception social role social stereotype conclusion lower proportion female smoker exerciser may account gender difference study cohort effect relationship physical exercise smoking behavior among chinese resident aged year older relationship diminishes time social change specific health problem chinese resident result current environmental factor also traced back social cultural background childhood agricultural society people land basic national condition planting crop higher profit main mean farmer improve livelihood ming qing dynasty tobacco planting production operation could obtain higher economic profit important reason rapid spread tobacco soon became indispensable part daily life alongside wine tea handed day reform opening integration tobacco marketing model market economy disposable income resident gradually increased resulting increase proportion resident smoke however since beginning new century implementation china tobacco control policy increase resident health awareness improvement education level proportion young people smoke china shown downward trend may reason social change produce cohort effect value significance study study initially confirmed negative association physical exercise smoking behavior chinese resident aged year older confirmed physical exercise protective factor smoking risk population explained possible mechanism physical exercise reduces smoking risk neurobiological level study provides simple effective side-effect-free way resident quit smoking provides solid data support introduction exercise-assisted smoking cessation policy relevant authority limitation study perspective sociology gender difference physical exercise smoking behavior chinese resident year old social phenomenon cross-sectional survey reflect correlation physical exercise smoking behavior establish causal relationship therefore rigorous epidemiological study needed effect physical exercise smoking behavior chinese resident conclusion study found physical exercise negatively associated smoking behavior among chinese resident aged year older significant protective factor smoking risk among male resident particular furthermore negative association physical exercise smoking behavior resident decrease time social change based result study recommended comprehensive national fitness initiative implemented build social network support build environmental social support system exercise participation improve motivation behavior contribute smoke-free society
