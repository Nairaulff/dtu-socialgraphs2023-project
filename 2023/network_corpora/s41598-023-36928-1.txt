introduction hyper-diversity phytophagous insect tropical area common phenomenon mechanism still debate explaining hyper-diversity coleoptera especially tropic hypothesis latitudinal gradient biodiversity related niche breadth proposed janzen according janzen hypothesis reduced seasonality tropic selects narrower thermal tolerance specie limiting dispersal capacity along tropical altitudinal gradient warmer valley cooler mountain top locally adapted trait would evolve limited niche breadth specie specialization promoting higher speciation rate tropical mountain temperate one alternative idea tropical plant-feeding insect specie richness direct consequence high tropical plant diversity rather increased host plant specialization however many study focused diversity different taxonomic functional group testing one hypothesis achieved contrasting conclusion latitude-niche breadth hypothesis preferred apparent pattern specialization degree along latitudinal gradient mean tropical specie would narrower niche breadth equates greater specialization beta-diversity plant-phytophagous insect food web indicated interaction preference insect host plant high beta-diversity value generally represent specie composition differ remarkably community assemblage across time space generally specie higher trophic level depend specie lower trophic level vice versa dependence stem presence least one resource specie prerequisite presence consumer specie thus speculate beta-diversity variation consumer result specie compositional change producer create biotic filter consumer close association likewise dissimilarity composition producer specie would scale trophic chain bring symmetrical pattern specialized consumer nevertheless necessarily valid generalist wider diet breadth host specie freely distributed exert influence distribution furthermore generalist broader niche breadth compared specialist spatial variation specie composition beta-diversity generalist commonly believed reflect extent satisfy niche requirement therefore generalist get lower value beta-diversity compared specialist although matching pattern could indicate host specialization phytophagous insect resource plant could also indicate parallel response taxon broad abiotic factor macro-climatic gradient shared historical process therefore pattern resulting parallel response macro-climatic gradient biogeographic history often difficult distinguish resulting biotic plant–insect interaction potential approach teasing force apart examine pattern association plant insect beta diversity different spatial scale usually biotic interaction exert influence relatively small spatial scale example research pointed effect biotic interaction measured principally local scale contrast abiotic factor usually influence broader spatial scale thus hypothesize pattern result insect-host specialization plant insect beta-diversity correlated fine spatial scale alternatively pattern result parallel response broad abiotic gradient beta-diversity pattern correlated broad spatial scale longhorn beetle cerambycidae belong order coleoptera class insecta larva

beta-diversity comparison insect plant niche breadth analysis see tropical beetle obtain lower niche breadth subtropical beetle assemblage contrast niche breadth tropical subtropical plant significantly different plant beta-diversity comparison showed plant turnover tropic mirrored subtropics multiple spatial scale however beetle community beta-diversity tropical area significantly higher subtropical area almost spatial scale divergence indicates longhorn beetle plant-feeding insect hold higher degree niche conservatism tropic subtropics speculate pattern also indicates higher degree host-specificity insect tropical zone subtropical one study plant alpha-diversity showed significant difference tropic subtropics beetle alpha-diversity significantly higher tropic subtropics therefore study strongly support hypothesis novotny hyper-diversity plant-feeding insect tropical area direct result greater diversity plant however janzen hypothesis explains higher degree host-specificity driving force diversification insect tropic tends supported longhorn beetle host specialist would inhabit narrower niche width tropic relative subtropics compared plant therefore plant insect gain higher diversity index tropic insect significantly higher another explanation phenomenon hyper-diverse group like tree tropical rainforest characterized functional redundancy niche specialization example neotropical tree shade tolerant shade-tolerant specie appear require finely partitioned abiotic niche janzen hypothesis bridge traditional contradictory two perspective i.e evolution vs. ecology explaining specie diversity along climatic gradient combine climate pattern adaptation mechanism explain macro-ecological phenomenon depicting climatic variability shaping evolution specie physiological trait geographical range size pattern limited longhorn beetle many study documented significant difference specie richness climatic gradient different habitat related niche-breadth conclusion study demonstrates host plant specialization wood-boring longhorn beetle change climatic zone furthermore implies greater ecological specificity contributes higher alpha- beta-diversity plant-feeding insect highlighting key role ecological specialization coexistence diversification insect specie partly explains many specie phytophagous insect tropic deny fact plant diversity profound impact structure plant-feeding insect community maintaining biodiversity however compared host-specificity niche conservatism importance plant specie diversity might pronounced study demonstrates specie host-specificity might shape wood-boring longhorn beetle diversity pattern different climatic zone limitation study recommendation although current study exhibit trend toward

environmental mechanism might significantly responsible diversity feeding behaviour longhorn beetle unfortunately present study measure important parameter therefore investigation required validate
