health predicting under-five child mortality regardless level analysis measured hand found gini index third important social determinant health predicting under-five child mortality however found non-linear relationship two variable low medium level gini index 0.45 approximately gini under-five child mortality negatively related however medium high level gini 0.45 approximately relationship becomes positive result consistent study example schell found gini index among three variable explaining infant mortality however author found gini important mainly middle-income country siddiqi found negative relationship gini infant mortality however including interaction gini time found association positive siddiqi suggest effect income inequality infant mortality depends time interaction social condition part lazariva prisco found relationship gini index infant mortality way avendano also found effect gini index infant mortality controlling difference country avendano considers social policy reduce infant mortality mainly concentrated country low inequality may affect possible effect gini infant mortality study using non-linear model needed explore relationship result showed random forest model error predicting under-five child mortality one problem machine learning model overfitting data however avoid overfitting trained three machine learning model random sample evaluated performance obtained importance variable cumulative dependence remaining data although machine learning model hypothesis testing like classical linear model several method implemented increase interpretability machine learning model use agnostic approach allows multiple model interpreted regardless internal structure use method variable importance perturbation main drawback permutation-based variable importance measure dependence selected subsamples consequently different permutation obtain general different result nevertheless use perturbation minimize much possible error derived random sampling another possible limitation variable measured three country specifically poverty measured differently country however trained one model per country taking account limitation research introduce potential selection bias excluding municipality lower data quality essential emphasize bias doe significantly impact validity result despite limitation found derived data quality method applied excluded population three country taking reference year vast majority population three country taken account analysis rigorous data quality assessment process aimed ensuring reliability accuracy data used analysis particularly vital information although excluded municipality tended greater socio-economic disadvantage found variable crucial study poverty significantly bias result case result could sub estimated moreover fact study mexico identified relationship poverty high mortality rate support consistency finding decision prioritize data quality quantity increased internal validity study also enhanced overall robustness reliability conclusion acknowledge limitation external validity due selection bias believe trade-off justifiable benefit utilizing high-quality data far outweigh potential drawback therefore remain confident study result provide meaningful accurate insight municipality higher data quality brazil ecuador mexico conclusion finding important implication latin america low- middle-income country despite fact observed increase availability human material resource health sewage piped water service also observed decrease poverty illiteracy inequality child mortality continues problem mainly affect developing country latin america caribbean slowing economic growth weak employment high inflation rate deepening prolonging economic social crisis latin america caribbean according cepal extreme poverty latin america caribbean went 13.1 13.8 representing reversal approximately year poverty reach 32.1 total population latin america caribbean end time inequality also increasing recent year region addition impact pandemic caused covid-19 also affected education sector region mainly due prolonged interruption face-to-face education may sharply increase illiteracy rate reduced year context according development bank latin america number vulnerable people also grown recent year latin america caribbean vulnerable people high risk falling poverty due event temporary loss income according organization number vulnerable people increased 38.5 people usually covered conditional transfer basic social protection program increase probability falling poverty aligning panorama finding study mandatory formulate public policy focused improving people living condition term education housing income equity access health among others would fundamental tool reducing infant mortality guaranteeing right child life result show important analyze child mortality multidimensional perspective socioeconomic educational specific approach health system country contemplated result analyzes make explicit relationship exists inequality socioeconomic background child mortality thus approach extends beyond limit health multisectoral public policy approach needed capable acting health organization also social economic aspect prioritizing population suffer deeper level social vulnerability moreover distribution government resource must equitable order effective public policy health care essence mechanism redistribution social advantage disadvantage according result prioritizing allocation public policy population greatest poverty lowest educational level could greater effect reducing infant mortality
