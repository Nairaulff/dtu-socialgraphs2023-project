introduction arising gouveia scientific report http gouveia colleague conducted genome-wide association study gwas polygenic risk score -derived phenotype 37,784 identified independent locus lead snp enormous increase compared recent largest gwas 1,126,563 identified locus show applied approach gouveia colleague may lead inflated false positive rate approach beta-estimates recent gwas alzheimer disease used construct european biobank sample using pruning thresholding p-value threshold next new case–control phenotype constructed based bottom top distribution removing initial sample lastly gwas conducted new prs-derived phenotype author reasoned enriching sample individual known ad-associated variant may also enrich unknown ad-associated variant major concern applied approach used

interestingly overlap discovery target cohort inflated false positive rate null-snps used construct prs-derived phenotype deflated null-snps see supplementary fig reason p-values null-snps correlated gwas gwas prs-derived phenotype sample overlap prs-derived phenotype correlated individual used selecting snp p-values smaller 0.05 similarly selects snp part p-values larger 0.05 consequence gwas prs-derived phenotype deflated test statistic null-snps included next varied p-value threshold inclusion i.e varying threshold 0.05 thus including either snp genome-wide significant snp respectively found using snp constructing prs-derived phenotype reduced inflation false positive rate well number false positive see supplementary fig reduction observed bias diluted across null-snps mean false positive rate decrease reducing p-value threshold resulted false positive rate inflated almost null-snp low p-value thus almost null-snps used construct prs-derived phenotype lastly evaluated potential power gain causal snp included calculated difference test statistic two gwas i.e prs-derived phenotype found strong power decrease mean difference 0.14 2.2 –16 gwas prs-derived phenotype explained reduction sample size partial phenotypic correlation prs-derived phenotype thus increase power observed causal snp included known snp causal true association distinguished reliably false positive summarize gouveia colleague used new study design aim improve power gwas alzheimer disease based simulation showed approach may lead inflated false positive rate 80,000-fold increase genome-wide significance threshold reason snp used construct prs-derived phenotype subsequently tested association newly constructed phenotype found false positive rate inflation pronounced case sample overlap discovery target cohort result show false positive rate inflated gwas prs-derived phenotype performed snp also used construct however note linkage disequilibrium snp included null-snps included could still result inflated false positive rate appealing approach may use leave-one-chromosome-out approach constructed using chromosome gwas prs-derived phenotype 22nd left-out chromosome repeated time chromosome left however simulation found power decrease causal snp included moreover note snp also correlated across chromosome due e.g non-random mating could theory also lead inflated false positive rate approach certain extent inflation could well negligible see supplementary note short discussion approach analyzing partly prs-derived phenotype including approach improve power conclude phenotype definition based require careful consideration subsequent gwas excluding snp linkage disequilibrium gwas used construct prs-derived phenotype prevents inflation false positive rate
