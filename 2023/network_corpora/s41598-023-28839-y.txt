introduction arteriovenous fistula avf one main option vascular access hemodialysis therapy avf usually created anastomosing arterial venous vessel upper extremity potentially reducing risk thrombosis infection compared arteriovenous graft long-term indwelling catheter therefore avf creation recommended first choice access japan however avf may present problem avf vein may become stenosed occluded frequently due burden pressure artery effect vascular puncture therapy general doppler ultrasonography could used device surveillance avf assessing vascular stenosis function including avf blood flow morphology avf stenosis percutaneous transluminal angioplasty pta might performed appropriate pta allows patient maintain avf patency adequate blood flow mature avf blood flow approximately ml/min non-physiological circulation may also affect systemic hemodynamics including cardiac output peripheral tissue circulation particular steal syndrome lead severe ischemia paid attention clinical
