introduction obesity epidemic become one important health issue lifestyle transition leading noncommunicable disease burden obesity appears unavoidable consequence modern living perspective obesity unhealthy lifestyle reframed healthy—avoiding obesity life choice main message health behaviour change programme society moreover obesity serious medical condition affect nowadays adult also child adolescent beside obesity underweight status also make child much vulnerable somatic mental illness nutritional status abnormality still under-recognized undertreated spite irreversible long-lasting health implication identification early sign two type abnormal nutritional status crucial usually nutritional status assessment done year school-aged child public health system however screen year nutritional status abnormality enough since nutritional status alter intensively child adolescent due natural growth developmental process significant change lifestyle factor health status also result nutritional status alteration obesity underweight usually defined body mass index bmi age-dependent cut-off critical value bmi inexpensive easy screening method nutritional status abnormality however bmi adequate indicator percent excess body fat bmi serious limitation nutritional status assessment body fat percentage estimation also possible tool estimating nutritional status however doe also limit body fat percentage estimation requires special equipment e.g dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry bioelectrical impedance analyser equation exist calculate body fat based anthropometric measurement usually circumference height weight moreover critical cut-offs determined obesity adult parental involvement child nutritional status assessment could sufficiently help family-based lifestyle intervention activity since parent usually fail evaluate child nutritional status easy-to-use sufficiently accurate method child nutritional status assessment could help evaluation therefore new monitoring system suggested introduced detail present paper monitoring overfat/obesity undernutrition child aged year adult aged 18+ using easy-to-perform body measurement new method doe require either child remove clothing special equipment subject method research design sampling method subject recruitment done using multilevel multistage sampling obtain subject represented diverse type settlement age sex distribution hungarian child aged year cross-sectional study carried 2014–2015 hungarian county capital main aim study collect information child bone development analyze accuracy
