accumulating evidence demonstrating serum hemoglobin concentration associated poor neurological outcome variety brain injury including traumatic brain injury tbi subarachnoid hemorrhage sah stroke

literature indicates risk progression iga nephropathy decrease increase serum level hemoglobin evidence suggests decline serum level hemoglobin g/dl related increased risk mortality patient acute

anemic mouse worse prognosis traumatic brain injury compared non-anemic mouse exact mechanism unclear meta-analysis mori colleague suggested serum level hemoglobin associated overall mortality disease progression patient metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer another meta-analysis revealed stroke patient present anemia onset higher risk mortality recent study shown lower serum level hemoglobin admission may predict extent kidney damage patient type diabetes best knowledge meta-analysis first investigate association serum level hemoglobin neurological outcome patient following cardiac arrest meta-analysis showed higher serum hemoglobin level may improve neurological prognosis patient survived cardiac arrest finding consistent cavicchi also reported patient following ohca higher serum level hemoglobin achieved full neurological recovery however data incomplete study selected inclusion current meta-analysis another study reported anemia risk factor cardiac arrest also general conclusion meta-analysis however tran published significant correlation serum level hemoglobin neurological prognosis ihca patient heterogeneity subgroup analysis contradict finding tran al. found high serum level hemoglobin improve neurological prognosis ohca ihca ohca ihca patient therefore serum hemoglobin testing may help physician patient choose appropriate treatment meta-analysis several limitation noted first number included small subgroup analysis prone error second study high heterogeneity subgroup analysis indicated cardiac arrest type serum hemoglobin sampling time might source heterogeneity included study cohort study two study multicenter study thus need large multicentre prospective cohort type study confirm result meta-analysis reduce heterogeneity data ethnic group country included thirdly result may vary depending time point cpc measurement conclusion serum hemoglobin level patient survived cardiac arrest may associated better neurological prognosis perhaps appropriate increase serum hemoglobin level improve neurological prognosis patient survived cardiac arrest remains seen future study cut-off value serum hemoglobin level recommend initiation transfusion therapy increase chance survival good neurological prognosis cardiac arrest
