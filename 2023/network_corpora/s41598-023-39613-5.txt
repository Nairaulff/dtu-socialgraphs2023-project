optimal survival additionally part emitted infectious particle may never produce exposure recipient host example deposited location inaccessible host furthermore data indirect transmission experiment confirm infectious material also dispersed environment example moved via air flow water movement movement contaminated object i.e fomite may cause material moved area close source part environment distant source thereby reducing probability infection near source time facilitating uptake distant recipient host depending speed dispersion material arriving larger distance source expected undergone
