introduction covid-19 pandemic exposed health system frailty exacted terrible death toll united state may million american died covid-19 death source personal tragedy social disruption also resulted unprecedented economic loss longstanding socioeconomic inequity loss evenly distributed economic analysis earlier pandemic estimated covid-19 related excess mortality may resulted 4.4 trillion loss estimate predicated conservative mortality estimate failed account pandemic would impact specific racial ethnic group far others analysis sought determine life expectancy loss due million covid-19 death resulting economic welfare loss race ethnic origin used full-income approach allows estimate combined impact national income growth value life lost method using national life table disaggregated race ethnicity calculated life expectancy birth age eliminating covid-19 cause death thereby reduction life expectancy attributable million death due covid-19 valued economic welfare loss three way

non-hispanic white population 16.1 hispanic population 14.3 non-hispanic black population 3.1 non-hispanic asian population age-adjusted death rate however highest hispanic population followed non-hispanic black population non-hispanic white population non-hispanic asian population among non-hispanic white population largest number death population year older among hispanic population 65–74-year-old population overall death contributed 3.08-year reduction life expectancy birth age reduction 3.02 year life expectancy loss highest hispanic population 5.31 year birth 5.23 year age

58.59 valued using age- race- ethnic-group-dependent vsly loss amounted 4.38 trillion non-hispanic white population contributing 2.88 trillion 65.82 see table table economic value life lost due covid-19 united state january may race ethnic origin full size table discussion finding highlight life expectancy reduction magnitude unprecedented since influenza pandemic million covid-19 death february may resulted drop life expectancy birth 3.08 year age 3.02 year age 2.07 year loss effectively reversed gain made last year reduction hispanic population twice large reduction non-hispanic white population reduction black population twice large reduction asian population lowest reduction hispanic population already reached largest life expectancy reduction record due early covid-19 death 81.8 78.8 year black population early decline led lowest life expectancy seen since 74.7–71.8 year covid-19 substantially decreased mortality advantage hispanic population non-hispanic white population gained prior covid-19 economic welfare loss measured term impact national income growth value life lost range 3.7 trillion—nearly half output loss expected due covid-19 since estimate exclude loss due morbidity long-term impairment affect nearly half hospitalized patient welfare loss likely higher uneven distribution loss across racial group also deeply troubling hispanic population welfare loss proportional population size non-hispanic black population however welfare loss approximately greater compared population contribution disparity driven lower pre-covid-19 life expectancy among black population age indicative underlying health disparity including high prevalence chronic condition associated worse covid-19 outcome well disproportionately lower socioeconomic status likely lead undesirable health outcome chronic stress brought racial discrimination moreover stark disparity life-expectancy existed covid-19 widened pandemic highlight difference place-based risk resource deficit experienced black community uneven distribution primary care service along racial line example extensively documented highlight burden systemic anti-black racism healthcare system since start pandemic prompted huge economic disruption massive public health challenge government spent 3.7 trillion response covid-19 including 12.4 billion vaccine development operation warp speed however investment must weighed staggering welfare loss outlined analysis current administration proposed apollo-style pandemic preparedness plan includes strengthening public health system particular focus reducing inequity cost 65.3 billion next ten year investment maybe insufficient address social welfare damage resulting covid especially hispanic non-hispanic black community disproportionately impacted estimate optimal investment pandemic preparedness vary set intervention optimize access care vulnerable population strengthens technological surveillance clinical manufacturing regulatory capacity respond future pandemic likely cost hundred billion dollar nonetheless weighed full income loss outlined paper investment likely yield substantial dividend moreover dismantling structural racism key driver shaping health inequity require coordinated inclusive multisectoral strategy level society failure address underlying driver inequity likely deleterious impact economy year come acknowledge analysis limitation estimate full income loss prone vsl-related limitation inconsistency age-vsl relationship estimate using age invariant vsl inherently higher compared estimate using age-sensitive vsl given higher concentration covid-19 death older age nonetheless life expectancy estimated loss consistent prior estimate albeit higher given million covid-related death considered summary analysis highlight massive economic loss resulting excess death covid-19 hispanic black american disproportionately impacted scale welfare loss underscore pressing need invest health united state prevent economic shock future pandemic threat
