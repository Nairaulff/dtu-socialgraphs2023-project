lipopolysaccharides also known endotoxin part outer membrane gram-negative bacteria vital maintaining structural integrity microorganism lipopolysaccharides gram-negative bacteria like coli trigger systemic local immune response several study used triggering inflammation release pro-inflammatory cytokine chicken activation tlr4 study hypothesized supplementation se-challenged broiler could affect inflammation pathway interacting pparγ tlr4 il-10 gene expression based previous study speculated dietary supplementation se-challenged broiler might reduce tlr4 expression due reduced

regulatory cell turn cell protein junction icam-1 neutrophil cd11b induce il-10 secretion neutrophil reduces inflammation inhibiting proliferation cell collectively study demonstrated disposal several microorganism mycobacteria gram-negative gram-positive bacteria enforce il-10 production neutrophil addition vitro investigation shown tlr4 agonist potentially induces il-10 secretion neutrophil present study showed supplementation colistin level g/kg numerically increased il-10 transcription infected bird based previous study increasing activity lps-stimulated regulatory cell could induce il-10 secretion neutrophil also il-10 production increased positive feedback il-10 regulating immune response study supplementation likely decreased gram-negative bacteria thus increasing intestinal soluble peptidoglycans lipoteichoic acid concentration cell contact regulator cell neutrophil finally increased il-10 production neutrophil demonstrated siepert speculate low level 0.3 g/kg colistin supplementation could decrease number harmful bacteria git reflected decreased il-10 cytokine exposed chicken increased secretion pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage also enhanced secretion anti-inflammatory cytokine neutrophil however infected chicken supplementation lowest level increased il-10 expression also reduced tlr4 expression restrain pathogen common criticism raised phage therapy follows stimulates production neutralizing antibody body therapy bacteria may become resistant bps active administered shortly bacterial infection use bps may associated risk immunological reaction although bacteria typical host bps also interact immune cell study shown get circulation regardless administered find bacterial host eliminated phagocytic cell moreover host immune system may produce antibody neutralizing antibody may one important factor reducing effectiveness phage therapy concentration anti-phage neutralizing antibody depends dose route administration oral administration slightly increase antibody response three approach solve problem repeating administration increasing dose using different bps study tried prevent problem repeated administration bacteria may become resistant could hamper effectiveness therapy however bacterial resistance doe seem problem therapy bacteria time resistant antibiotic addition use multiple bps reduce development bacterial resistance naghizadeh also reported use phage cocktail control colibacillosis effective single one due synergistic effect created among individual phage according previous study therapy

easier control indeed systemic infection detected exposed bird isolated liver jeong also reported whereas effectively treated infected chicken fewer exposed chicken infected transmitted salmonella gallinarum added diet infected bird result showed could included diet dietary supplement prevent bacterial infection reduce spreading infection flock third act growth promoter supplement diet even flock without disease another experiment studied effect growth promoter supplement normal condition without bacterial challenge found supplementation improved gut health function increasing beneficial bacteria improving production performance broiler chicken agreement previous work broiler layer demonstrated adding colistin diet exposed bird rearing period effective controlling salmonella infection however adding antibiotic diet associated risk antibiotic act specifically may kill beneficial bacteria gut leading dysbacteriosis hand reported adding antibiotic diet bird reared normal condition without bacterial challenge may detrimental effect intestinal cell condition bacterial host gut therefore may destroy intestinal villus deteriorate bird production performance lei also added virginiamycin diet broiler chicken reporting virginiamycin shortened villus height duodenum jejunum another experiment studied effect colistin growth promoter agp broiler chicken finding adding colistin diet bird first day rearing period reduced growth performance use antibiotic banned many country due bacterial resistance contrary using risky based result current study seem promising alternative antibiotic controlling salmonella broiler chicken conclusion using treat bacterial infection new strategy however study used supplement prevent spreading transmission salmonella bird demonstrated could used feed additive increase growth performance control salmonella pathogenic bacteria broiler addition supplementation lead down-regulation tlr4 pparγ transcription gene up-regulation il-10 gene expression resulting reduced git inflammation
