introduction conspiracy theory attribute cause significant social political event small powerful group individual organisation act secretly benefit common good omnipresent among western society shown many member public endorse least one conspiracy theory become prevalent time emergency crisis uncertainty surprisingly ever since coronavirus disease covid-19 caused novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 spread rapidly around world wuhan hubei province china december becoming global health social economic crisis lead many emerged shortly first news covid-19 skyrocketed world health organisation declared spread coronavirus pandemic march lockdown usage social medium increased platform youtube facebook twitter become major vector dissemination covid-19-related leading unique infodemic general mass suspicion going spread infodemic significant consequence affect people health behaviour adherence preventive measure covid-19 pandemic fact beginning various origin covid-19 virus effectiveness vaccine side effect spreading associated people perception infection risk resistance following early control measure non-pharmaceutical intervention intended curb spread infection i.e using personal protective equipment social distancing testing isolation quarantine lockdown moreover research showed historically belief impeded population immunisation covid-19-related also associated increased tendency resist vaccination consequently identified significant threat public health time previous research often focused either psychological political structural aspect suggesting people conspiratorial thinking result either psychological factor i.e bias emotion various personality trait intuitive paranoid style thinking versus worldviews ideology i.e political ideological self-identification populism institutional distrust disadvantaged social status i.e ethnic minority lower consequently particular attention paid education religiosity political orientation trust science researcher consider education essential covariate believing among many factor example swami suggested people higher education better trained analytical logical thinking aware counterargument make resistant conspiracy belief douglas showed higher level education reduces one tendency attribute agency intentionality doe exist decrease personal appeal besides van prooijen demonstrated people higher education sceptical idea complex problem simple solution greater feeling control social environment resulting scepticism towards regarding factor impacting people belief many study suggested positive correlation religiosity argued people declare religious sceptical science tend bound conservatism traditionalism offer support conspiracy belief often also shown apocalyptic belief hidden force shaping human history also drive support finally conspiracy narrative quasi‐religious element including prophecy esotericism millennialism suggested religiosity somewhat dogmatic religious belief i.e. fundamentalism impact past study also demonstrated tendency endorse strongly influenced rejection distrust science scepticism towards scientist lower trust scientist associated higher susceptibility covid-19-related misinformation higher confidence science scientist strongest predictor adherence public health behaviour fighting pandemic addition people higher trust science likely believe frame vaccine dangerous unnecessary likely get vaccinated finally research showed political orientation particularly political extremism associated conspiracy thinking van prooijen explained result highly structured thinking style intends make sense societal event characterised belief simplistic explanation societal problem moreover political extremism strongly associated dichotomous i.e. black-and-white thinking social event classified good evil like positive negative inspired previous study analysis considers education essential covariate
