introduction sarcopenia characterized age-related loss muscle mass muscle strength and/or physical performance contributes development frailty associated poor clinical outcome mortality functional disability fall hip fracture hospitalization factor found increase risk sarcopenia include aging physical inactivity malnutrition poor dental health chronic disease cardiovascular disease diabetes hypertension dementia particular multiple physiological change associated aging found contribute development sarcopenia include protein synthesis abnormality degradation cellular senescence oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction low-grade inflammation inadequate nutrition hormonal change satellite cell dysfunction however pathophysiological mechanism responsible sarcopenia yet fully elucidated recent study found relationship endothelial dysfunction age-related loss muscle mass grip strength asymmetric dimethylarginine adma endogenous amino acid competitively inhibits endothelial synthesis

blood sample stored may affected adma level fourth used bioimpedance analysis measure skeletal muscle mass although gold standard body composition measurement dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry criterion sarcopenia include smi measured bioimpedance analysis fifth incidence sarcopenia may underestimated study participant gait speed could measured owing space limitation however prevalence sarcopenia community-dwelling older japanese woman reported 16.5 previous study prevalence sarcopenia current study 22.2 seem underestimated prevalence sarcopenia rather may obtained slightly higher
