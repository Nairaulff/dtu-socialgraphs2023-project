introduction surgical implantation cochlear implant become standard treatment option restoring hearing loss patient every age group including new-born infant young 9–10 month old placing electrode array optimally inside scala-tympani compartment cochlea excess electrode lead coiled mastoid drilled cavity following standard surgical procedure literature show natural growth overall mastoid thickness measured linear distance cochlear entrance skull surface well overall width skull measured one side age rapid growth mastoid thickness approximately year age reaching average growth slows reach plateau 30–35 around puberty similar growth pattern seen mastoid surface area around 3.5–4 age one average growth rate 1–1.2 per year year age thereafter growth rate decrease reach maximum surface area puberty literature shown electrode array extrusion cochlea may occur following surgery rate 2–3 straight lateral wall electrode type compared pre-curved electrode type rate electrode array extrusion much pre-curved electrode type complication like electrode tip fold-over scalar deviation reported higher rate pre-curved electrode type straight electrode type logical thinking excess electrode lead mastoid drilled cavity would relax response natural growth mastoid time alone primary reason electrode array extrusion recently alhabib reported change electrode lead coiled configuration mastoid drilled cavity response mastoid growth subject subject studied extrusion electrode array etiology behind electrode array extrusion/migration fully explained growth mastoid area proposed one factor affecting migration pulling excess lead consequently electrode gradually cochlea excess coiling electrode lead store kinetic energy always want escape electrode lead adequately secured could spring back pulling electrode array cochlea surgical device solution available secure excess electrode lead mastoid drilled cavity electrode array migration still reported smaller rate

mastoid volume non-implanted patient using three-dimensional reconstructed model whereas approach involved applying regular pacs-mpr used clinical practice comparison method published far benefit method definition consistent plane measurement enables measurement follow-up image aligned manner first image schilde report growth rate mastoid 0.76 ml/year male 0.53 ml/year female study found growth rate mastoid average 239.48 0.239 ml/year lee reported average growth rate mastoid per year 4.32 3.31 ml/year male female respectively present study mean preoperative volume 1.62 0.37–3.72 age 0.92–3.92 year mean postoperative volume 2.43 1.53–4.06 age 3.25–11.33 year known size mastoid varies considerably individual comparing volume another study say relatively little effect mastoid growth study seems growth rate mastoid volume table lower compared finding schilde al. except patient electrode migration electrode migration right ear six basal electrode extruded cochlea growth mastoid enlarged compared case table measurement bec remained unchanged patient considering measurement error observed one year age preoperative image mastoid volume quite small postoperative volume bigger case patient much younger patient postoperative time point another interesting finding change mastoid volume patient mastoid reach final size around age puberty however case volume increase year month follow-up period despite patient close puberty end follow-up period hard speculate mastoid drilling surgery may affected mastoid growth following surgery case whereas case due smaller sample size could draw conclusion mastoid drilling could affect mastoid growth thus study larger sample size needed investigate finding mastoid volume measured study close agreement earlier finding generally endorses use simple measurement technique applied study linear distance rw-ss rw-bec ss-bec form three side triangle measurement system best knowledge previous report uniform method mastoid measurement using pac system showed clear correlation linear measurement mastoid volume method advantage aligning image standardized format measurement made proposed method seems promising validation technique larger sample size reproducibility required conclusion observed increase mastoid volume linear distance key anatomical point mastoid bone comparing pre-operative post-operative image time drilling away mastoid air cell cochlear implantation doe seem affect natural growth mastoid air cell system child due small sample size remains inconclusive whether mastoid growth associated electrode migration therefore warrant research
