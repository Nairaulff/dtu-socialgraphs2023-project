respectively previous work showed spill-over contamination human occurred vole outbreak year result suggests spill-over contamination likely also affected iberian hare region francisella tularensis infection cause increased mortality hare although individual may respond differently infection hare may die overwhelming bacteraemia others may survive protracted course infection would contribute maintenance tularensis prevalence consistent view hare act key reservoir system vole cause pulse tularemia contamination outbreak hare may play key role maintaining bacterium least one year vole peak since hare eventuality decline outbreak tularemia detected hare inter-epizootics beyond second year outbreak environmental reservoir must involved tularemia cycle contributing persistence tularensis environment prolonged survival pathogen may occur outside host example water invertebrate vector e.g. tick might aid infection later point vole number increase regardless pathogen persists interepizootic period result suggest tularensis spill-over facilitated vole population outbreak contributed reduced hare population growth rate process may trapping hare population locally stable state low density study area i.e. disease pit scenario keeping hare number underneath threshold abundance around hares/hunter fig situation arises low prey density rate population growth lower rate diseases-induced mortality increase increased prey density similar disease pit situation suggested european wild rabbit oryctolagus cuniculus doñana national park dnp southern spain sudden population crash due impact rabbit haemorrhagic disease rhd 1990s rabbit number kept stable dnp low density due predator regulation i.e. predator pit however rhd still killing susceptible animal recruited year reproduction dnp consequently population progressively declining alternative explanation observed hare decline vole outbreak year first hare might declined vole control action example collateral damage rodenticide use e.g. bromadiolone chlorophacinone probably contributed higher hare mortality 2007–08 outbreak use bromadiolone allowed large-scales unlikely explain hare population decline subsequence vole outbreak since anticoagulant rodenticide use prohibited afterwards second alternative explanation hare decline vole outbreak could impact predator attracted sudden prey increase landscape i.e. common vole however increase generalist vole predator usually occur time delay take time vole predator breed last alternative explanation seems unlikely given iberian hare population decline occurred vole outbreak year without lag still plenty vole specialist generalist predator feed disease difficult manage control wild effective future effort increase iberian hare population based reliable information includes simultaneous data population dynamic field epidemiology future work needed confirm disease pit hypothesis proposed absence tularaemia vaccine wildlife suggest informative approach would detailed longitudinal study tularemia infection among iberian hare tagging hare allow determine demographic parameter survival reproduction relate tularemia infection would also useful compare demographic parameter hare area without tularensis verify recruitment higher mortality rate tularemia absent thereby obtain empirical evidence supporting disease pit scenario
