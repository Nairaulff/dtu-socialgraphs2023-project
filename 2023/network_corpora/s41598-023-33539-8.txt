endometrium evident according microarray analysis reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction study kinetics expression lh/hcg receptor endometrium suggests receptor could even constitute marker endometrial receptivity delicate interaction embryo endometrium crucial timing window implantation affected several factor including hormonal milieu interaction considered assumed triggering hcg already started increase could problematic endometrium already exposed activated therefore window implantation could theoretically shift cause implantation failure due asynchronous endometrium ivf unit modified ovu-fet usually triggered hcg surge however scenario fet day scheduled triggering hcg already started rise example starting rise level still low waiting spontaneous ovulation might require transfer weekend unit closed hcg trigger led scheduling fet day later case believe although theoretically triggering hcg elevated lead asynchronous endometrium poorer outcome practice effect apparently minor peaked level ng/ml several study compared true modified fet result reported support finding retrospective study groenewoud reported similar ongoing pregnancy rate compared modified nc-fet hcg given surge modified nc-fet hcg given surge however defined surge iu/l level seems low may reflect baseline level reported study add uncertainty regarding conclusion result support

include ultrasound scan hormonal blood monitoring increase cost however center government supported compensation per fet cycle regardless number follow-up visit moreover scan may increase cost per transfer cycle cancelation even expensive strength study include involved large cohort one center relatively short period embryo frozen vitrification taken together factor decrease potential difference practice addition accurate baseline level reported well day hcg trigger conclusion study contributes information help clarify inconsistency regarding triggering ovulation hcg ovu-fet cycle particularly surge begun outcome ovu-fet cycle comparable regardless whether ovulation triggered surge begun result seem reassuring indicate hcg given even surge started ng/ml believe finding present flexible approach allows hcg triggering ovulation surge started without compromising fet outcome strategy allows greater flexibility scheduling fet day administering hcg hormonal change determine window implantation adjusted way suit schedule patient clinic potentially fewer cancelations due weekend holiday closure without detrimental effect desired outcome well-planned trial larger patient population including cost-effectiveness assessment needed develop guide best practice
