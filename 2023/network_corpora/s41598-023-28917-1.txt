introduction coronavirus disease covid-19 promotes significant burden symptom subacute long term post infection commonly reported residual symptom include fatigue dyspnoea chest pain among others collectively described post-acute covid-19 syndrome long covid progressive implementation effective vaccination severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 mitigated risk complication including hospitalisation mortality recent report suggest vaccination reduce long covid patient need hospitalisation therefore unclear whether vaccination status influence magnitude long covid symptom patient severe disease frequently require intensive support susceptible long-term complication current study systematically evaluated several long covid symptom day hospital discharge consecutive patient according vaccination status hypothesised patient incomplete vaccination would present least one symptom compared patient complete vaccination least two dos vaccine dose janssen™ vaccine described others moreover incomplete vaccination would independently associated persistence symptom hospital discharge method study reviewed institutional review board caae 45978621.9.0000.5461 deemed

analysis evaluating independent variable associated symptom day hospitalization due covid-19 full size table discussion study evaluated potential impact vaccination long covid symptom hospital discharge following result obtained despite patient complete vaccination older substantially high frequency several comorbidities probably worldwide vaccination strategy initially focused vulnerable individual presented lower frequency symptom day hospital discharge result may partially explained fact patient incomplete vaccination complication hospitalisation received complete vaccination table however multivariate analysis revealed complete vaccination independently associated lower rate symptom day hospital discharge taken together result emphasise role vaccination promoting lower chance long covid hospital discharge evidence supporting impact vaccination long covid scarce limited mild case survey conducted community-dwelling population united kingdom 23.7 reported long covid symptom regardless severity least follow-up least week post infection likelihood long covid symptom decreased vaccination however 3.2 population required hospitalisation acute phase recent systematic review six study including preprints revealed vaccination sars-cov-2 infection could reduce risk subsequent long covid overall study reported long covid patient hospitalised therefore study add literature providing consistent result also demonstrating benefit vaccination long covid also observed severe case i.e patient sars-cov-2 infection require hospitalisation date definitive answer lower rate long covid vaccination vaccination increase antibody titre potentially eliminate viral reservoir conceivable abnormality cell platelet vascular endothelium clotting factor related covid-19 mitigated vaccination consistent previous finding hospitalised patient completed vaccination lower rate significant complication including thrombotic event study strength included consecutive patient hospitalised due confirmed covid-19 two hospital used standard procedure checking vaccination status performing structured interview looking symptom day hospital discharge access vaccination status severity hospitalisation however need acknowledge following study limitation influence vaccine type outcome long covid could tested several potential combination limit ability detect statistically significant difference long covid symptom time data collection third fourth dos implemented brazilian vaccination program therefore number patient hospitalised despite receiving three four dos small addition finding explained higher protection offered patient received extra dos hospital admission another limitation follow-up short 90-day symptom relied patient notification multiple evaluation overtime would interesting explore potential impact complete vaccination dynamic change symptom finally explore whether impact complete vaccination long covid might influenced variant sars-cov-2 lack genetic confirmation relative sample size prevented utility analysis conclusion result suggest effective vaccination may decrease burden long covid patient require hospitalisation therefore finding add recent literature suggesting multiple benefit vaccination covid-19 infection hospital admission severity hospitalisation long covid
