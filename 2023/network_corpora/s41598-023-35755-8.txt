consanguinity high prevalence many culture society worldwide twenty per cent world population life society consanguineous marriage prevalent highest rate described middle east 20–50 reaching certain region union seem confer social economic advantage society strengthening family tie leading greater marriage stability even better support female partner spouse first degree cousin share 1/8th 12.5 gene inherited common ancestor hence offspring homozygous 1/16th 6.25 locus meaning receive identical gene copy parent genome site large run homozygosity roh distributed throughout genome descendant

previous publication shown increased risk neonatal infant death rate among offspring consanguineous marriage approximately 2.5 time higher among offspring unrelated parent addition higher rate pregnancy complication described including increased risk early pregnancy loss previously author presented controversial result regarding miscarriage rate among consanguineous population important notice early pregnancy pregnancy loss easily missed study recruit woman later first trimester population little access healthcare addition preclinical loss difficult diagnose considered resulting
