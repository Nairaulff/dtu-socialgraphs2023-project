asia new zealand acris tolerant wide range habitat including natural seminatural strictly man-made habitat e.g. meadow pasture wasteland roadside railroad embankment forest clearing although believed

resource likely reduce population size specie due inhibition seed germination hand nondisturbed naturally subsaline meadow tolerance sodic salinity allows successful establishment similar conclusion drawn vegetative growth studied specie seems niche similar several commonly occurring dicotyledonous plant nonspecialized general meadow specie however taking account result present study contrary hypothesis stated acris probably susceptible saline condition trifolium repens taraxacum hieracium specie represents salinity tolerance similar achillea millefolium trifolium pratense growth inhibition due mmol nacl treatment observed field observation acris roadside road ditch anthropogenic salinity road maintenance serious problem common central europe habitat often characterized higher salinity intuitively contrary described growth relation also characterized higher water ability help acris survive reproduce notably growth specie substantially inhibited plant grown mmol nacl-treated

hypothesized design study although stimulating effect caused low dos nacl salt known phenomenon also observed wild cultivated plant specie including glycophytes finding satisfactory explanation growth stimulation plant saline subsaline condition difficult task even halophyte must noted effect species-specific refer relatively narrow concentration window selected salt including nacl 20–50 mmol considering presented result taking consideration low content soil used presumed acris specie whose optimal niche realized subsaline soil salt load threshold soil salinity mmol nacl similar typical soil temperate meadow pasture rangeland mean acris well adapted habitat severely disturbed anthropogenic salt loading basis study also stated acris doe experience serious problem mineral nutrition could associated progressing sodic salinity line hypothesis rather unusual sodic salinity halt adequate acquisition macro- micronutrient however several halophytic halotolerant plant known maintain mineral nutrition rather stably sodic salinity e.g. tamarix gallica sesuvium portulacastrum crithmum maritimum context physiology acris resembles functioning halophyte valuable specie balanced mineral nutrition known ensure survival individual reproduction observable effect increasing salinity accumulation aerial part studied individual always youngest leaf variation content greater whole shoot

stress observed change value seen adjustment contributing positively plant fitness salinity due small size effect associated effect reduced area leaf worsened functioning photosynthetic apparatus contrary hypothesis result demonstrated leaf plant subjected saline stress smaller also developed dysfunction level photosynthetic apparatus contrary hypothesis several previous work suggested apart

increase decrease value observed nacl-stressed plant specie correlation analysis strongly suggests major source mode action thus indicates osmotic- and/or nutritional-caused limitation plant cell

chlorophyll content except mmol nacl contrast evident deterioration plant functioning high salt dos plant subjected mmol nacl encountered slight stimulation selected parameter hypothesized occur design study similar stimulation e.g. considering value observed beta vulgaris plant specie prefers mild salinity another argument seeing acris specie able take advantage subsaline condition including temperate meadow pasture generally determination csr strategy considered useful comparison different plant specie however also used monitoring response environmental stressor including salinity case acris intensifying salinity mmol nacl caused slight significant shift competition-oriented disturbance-oriented strategy rephrasing salinity decreased investment development large leaf growth general

confirmed study shortage photosynthesis product intensification need associated process growth also worth noting plant develop adjustment associated stress tolerance opposite observed plant subjected mmol nacl promoted greater competition balanced development toward c/csr-type strategy mean subsaline condition e.g. meadow specie greater competitive stance grows nonsaline saline habitat probably help monopolize access resource mostly space light wide spectrum natural man-made habitat looking practical context study worth noting recent study showed acris suitable monitoring availability soil greater availability soil greater leaf concentration study agrees finding also suggests spatial inconsistency plant occurrence due inhibition seedling establishment easily catchable conspicuous difference plant physiognomy acris plant size leaf morphology due intoxication signal suggesting progressing salinization habitat conclusion present study show growth development functioning acris seriously deteriorated upon sodic salinity specie withstand subsaline constantly temporarily slightly saline habitat however malfunction observed acris seem effect simple intoxication effect
