introduction rapidly diminishing global boundary readily available communication device increasing popularity social medium new trend extreme becoming normal today attention-driven society domain like religion politics trend evident whereas area like music lifestyle food healthcare day-to-day choice visible still present covertly ubiquitous presence trend make important understand cause effect identify method intervene necessary appropriate religious violent extremism well-discussed topic literature due global presence destructive outcome however category extremism grow gradually time remain unnoticed ultimate consequence visible use term eccentricity distinguish extremism traditional political religious extremism impact eccentricity perceived various form spreading hate disharmony eccentric behavior polarizes society fanaticism favorite celebrity singer politician often lead personal rivalry threat cyber-bullying scenario eccentricity injurious fatal outcome observed anti-vaccine movement firearms-related discourse impact eccentric opinion behavior limited social individual issue influence financial economic domain industry often utilize behavioral tendency change

extremism definition restricted application domain work directly used define eccentricity broader context definition cover aspect extremism ignores rest researcher consider extremism term violence weigh opinion based whether opinion result action opinion result action mostly destructive opinion considered extreme e.g. leading terrorism coup major drawback popular definition doe quantify strength opinion definition make binary classification extremism would miss scenario extremism might result direct action may cause gradual escalation opinion another common way define eccentricity using threshold method continuous model method opinion strength quantified range possible value strength greater predefined threshold opinion considered extreme eccentric one major challenge method deciding threshold threshold value varies different environment different background different task opinion qualify extreme one setting versus another even setting time opinion initially classified eccentric may sound sensible presence eccentric idea later vice versa study chose simplest dictionary definition eccentricity deviation norm norm conversation discussion defined center opinion social
