introduction liver cirrhosis one major disease burden worldwide last decade natural course cirrhosis understood two distinct stage disease identified compensated decompensated cirrhosis decompensated cirrhosis causing million death annually rank 14th among leading cause death adult estimated 1.5–5 patient progress compensated cirrhosis decompensated cirrhosis annually 5-year mortality without liver transplantation patient end-stage liver cirrhosis liver transplantation remains treatment option however limited due lack liver donor death waiting list high medical expense thus paramount significance identify patient would benefit early clinical practice main non-invasive method used ass prognosis cirrhosis stage model end-stage liver disease meld child–pugh score application

noxious stressor localize eliminate endogenous exogenous source insult although pathophysiology acute-on-chronic liver failure aclf remains studied study shown sir may play important role occurrence development aclf unlike patient acute decompensation organ failure patient aclf severe systemic inflammation oxidative stress study aclf shown systemic inflammation directly related severity syndrome greater intensity systemic inflammation greater number organ failure higher short-term mortality rate systemic inflammatory response often accompanied excessive release proinflammatory cytokine inflammatory cytokine stimulate activate neutrophil promote phagocytosis bactericidal efficacy return neutrophil promote inflammation secreting range cytokine il-1 il-8 releasing number enzyme containing particle oxidant protease antimicrobial protein mediate liver inflammation apoptosis hepatocyte necrosis onset acute infection neutrophil predominant immune cell driving early inflammatory response neutrophil count used significant indicator systemic infection therefore neutrophil rapidly recruited acute inflammatory response used marker tissue inflammation disease severity addition study also found cohort although significant difference serum albumin 90-day dead patient surviving patient stratifying nar found serum albumin level high nar group significantly lower low nar group serum albumin level represent systemic inflammation albumin synthesis decrease response inflammatory cytokine il-6 study revealed decreased albumin related adverse outcome acutely ill patient addition inflammatory status serum albumin reported reflect individual nutrition status albumin produced liver hypoalbuminemia common complication patient cirrhosis lead ascites edema leading increased
