introduction triazole antifungal first choice preventing treating invasive fungal infection addition recommended prophylactic treatment general antifungal prophylaxis patient undergoing solid organ hematopoietic stem cell transplantation generally triazole antifungal must taken long period week month followed long-term suppressive therapy however long-term use triazole antifungal raised concern cost development resistance treatment-related adverse effect meanwhile increasing use frequency triazole antifungal drug safety receiving attention common adverse event voriconazole include visual impairment fever rash nausea vomiting diarrhea headache septicemia peripheral edema abdominal pain respiratory dysfunction periostitis caused voriconazole therapy described various case report symptom periostitis typically include myalgia diffuse pain one skeletal area often involving tibia orbital bone root bone case report published new england journal medicine revealed patient voriconazole-induced periostitis reduced pain 7-month follow-up discontinuation voriconazole range motion limitation bone swelling persisted hand case infectious periostitis sepsis may occur involve body organ addition suggested periostitis mainly caused fluoride voriconazole alternative therapy triazole antifungal clinically considered avoid periostitis however study association periostitis triazole antifungal large population including signal mining study based adverse event reporting database therefore unclear whether association periostitis triazole antifungal real-world clinical setting fda adverse event reporting system faers database utilized collecting information spontaneously reported adverse drug event due large amount data diversity data information free access public often used study adverse drug event signal mining faers receives approximately 1.5 million report adverse event drug medical device every year reflect adverse event real-world clinical setting addition data mining algorithm already developed signal detection database example positive signal refers statistical association adverse event drug thus faers widely used detect potential
