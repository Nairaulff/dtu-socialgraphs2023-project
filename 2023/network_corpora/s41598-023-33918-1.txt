exhalatory event generating aerosol breathing coughing talking singing sneezing example single sneeze release 40,000 aerosol particle physical point view term aerosol corresponds heterogeneous mixture airborne particle solid liquid suspended gas relatively low settling velocity i.e typically airborne particle aerodynamic diameter lower however medical literature decade distinction frequently found appearing arbitrary misleading aerosol scientist airborne particle smaller diameter droplet larger diameter confusion emanating traditional medical language sometimes created scientific unfounded terminology distinction so-called airborne droplet transmission indeed people inhale aerosol particle variable size space time always dynamic transitory phenomenon mainly constituted droplet
