introduction erectile dysfunction represents common disease subject experience incapacity obtain maintain erection satisfactory sexual performance disorder may featured severe impact quality life patient partner etiology historically subdivided three main category organic mixed psychogenic note although classification widely employed categorize patient complex disorder multifactorial factor involved therefore term primary organic primary psychogenic implemented redefine patient according binary etiological classification primary organic several factor involved evolution disease including vascular neurologic i.e. caused deficit nerve signaling corpus cavernosa iatrogenic e.g. secondary radical pelvic surgery endocrinological factor among vasculogenic common etiology account case primary organic vasculogenic impairment proper functioning penile vasculature occurs latter requiring complex interplay multiple component nitric oxide play major role erectile function molecule released terminal cavernous nerve corpus cavernosum activates guanylate cyclase cavernous smooth muscle cell latter process resulting smooth muscle relaxation arteriolar vasodilation moreover also released vascular endothelium response parasympathetic activation therefore neurovascular dysfunction relation impairment no-related process may lead impairment blood flow regulation corpus cavernosum finally contribute pathogenesis vasculogenic even though cavernous small vessel disease demonstrated involved pathogenesis vasculogenic microcirculation corpus cavernosum still difficult explored vivo since cavernous retinal vasculature resemblance term morphologic functional attribute assessment retinal vasculature may thus beneficial provide new relevant insight pathogenesis vasculogenic notably

disease furthermore assuming may imply systemic endothelial dysfunction previous study tried elucidate whether patient may characterized alteration retinal vessel using dva chew performed static analysis retinal vessel patient type diabetes without diabetic retinopathy agreement result latter study author demonstrated patient characterized higher value crve comparison healthy control two hypothesis suggested explain finding since wider retinal venular diameter thought reflect inflammation supposed retinal venular dilatation may reflect thickening intima-media secondary atherosclerosis alternatively wider retinal venular diameter may secondary endothelial dysfunction previously suggested nevertheless finding partially disagreement reported chew showed reduction crae value patient however study chew al. enrolled patient older analyzed study i.e. mean age 65.6 vs. 52.0 year number subject sign diabetic retinopathy assuming age diabetic retinopathy factor demonstrated significantly affect crae value study cohort difference two study might explain result inconsistency importantly result wider retinal arteriolar diameter i.e. increase crae value patient may reflect thickening intima-media endothelial dysfunction add literature providing data retinal neurovascular coupling subject primary organic vasculogenic erectile dysfunction asserted dva testing healthy subject provides biphasic response reflecting primary vasodilation secondary vasoconstriction vasodilatation seems provoked photoreceptors latter causing increase level subsequent rise retinal blood flow cohort vessel response flicker stimulus reduced reduction mainly characterized artery vasodilatation asserted released vascular endothelium terminal cavernous nerve result smooth muscle relaxation arteriolar vasodilation therefore impairment no-related process thought contribute pathogenesis vasculogenic similarly result may suggest patient also characterized impairment retinal vessel endothelium resulting diminished production crucial obtaining vasodilatation flicker stimulation alternatively smaller response might secondary increased rigidity retinal artery view fact systemic vessel displayed featured thickened intima-media patient finally decreased metabolic demand associated neuronal degeneration might cause lower vascular response however structural oct data show significant difference term retinal structure patient healthy control one notable result study metric reflecting retinal neurovascular coupling i.e. arterial dilation reaction amplitude significantly associated severity detail displayed retinal arterial dilation reaction amplitude directly correlated increase iief-ef score improvement erectile function result may indicate common pathophysiological process impaired retinal neurovascular coupling patient main limitation report subject assessed single time point prospective study testing retinal vessel patient may shed light whether impaired retinal neurovascular coupling may also affect retinal function patient moreover although patient study cohort homogenously categorized affected primary organic able exclude psychogenic component may also present number patient importantly latter aspect may impacted iief-ef score furthermore study cohort composed caucasian men therefore finding limited kind patient also provide data measurement repeatability although reported previously finally sample size cohort relatively small reduces power analysis particular powered evaluate small difference two group conclusion report provided fully integrated assessment either static dynamic modification retinal vessel subject primary organic vasculogenic erectile dysfunction showed retinal vascular alteration distinguish disorder arterial function inversely correlated severity result confirm may associated systemic endothelial dysfunction future report prolongated longitudinal follow studied cohort may furnish additional substantive information retinal vascular metric may prove useful biomarker monitoring value therapeutic approach predict disease progression importantly assessment retinal function healthy men may provide information whether metric may predict development time
