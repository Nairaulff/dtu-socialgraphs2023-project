image-guided percutaneous needle localization enb dye marking needle placement intraoperative technique commonly used percutaneous needle localization hookwire localization common complication associated technique pneumothorax rate range 7.5 addition parenchymal hemorrhage frequently reported dislodgement occurs 2.5–13 case however rare major complication systemic air embolism reported rate 0.6 large case report moreover technique originally designed breast nodule localization might optimal choice pulmonary lesion enb-guided dye marking gained lot popularity recent year localization

lesion enb-related complication observed however patient still receive radiation intraoperative image enb system viable rural low-income area access equipment training limited hospital intraoperative technique widely used localizing pulmonary nodule since 1990s many clinician reported safe effective option allowing intraoperative spns identification case nonetheless nodule ggo semisolid appearance

localize nodule effectively safely far know one largest series new localization performed date localization experience spns multidisciplinary effort year share cumulative experience hope aid thoracic surgeon first unlike hookwire keep length steel wire outside body localization push soft suture attached claw thorax may significantly reduce tension chest wall claw caused position change respiratory movement seen dislodgement wire firmly attached chest wall second find 4-hook anchor claw important component new device claw gradually released hook adjacent tissue without causing great structural damage remarkably reducing risk pneumothorax parenchymal hemorrhage third claw endure considerable traction operation pull suture lift adjacent lung tissue create better visual field exposure make convenient resect lesion maximize preservation lung function fourth scale-coaxial needle assist surgeon regarding precise localization one important process take pusher withdraw scale-coaxial needle end within 0.5–1 inner surface chest wall tip needle exposed pleural cavity case nodule adjacent visceral pleura need dealt carefully end coaxial needle pushed little beyond nodule avoid failure breaking visceral pleura pseudo-pneumothorax caused needle pushing tissue fifth find tri-color suture reliable marker help evaluating depth nodule ensures adequate negative margin wedge resection segmentectomy however found depth pulmonary nodule length suture lung tissue significantly associated occurrence parenchymal hemorrhage suggest surgeon always aware risk parenchymal hemorrhage nodule deep lung tissue sixth found coaxial needle inevitably placed acute angle surface visceral pleura localization apex diaphragm case claw likely displaced surface lung tissue make vat resection difficult moreover segmentectomy lobectomy performed entry point displaced claw included resected lesion avoid continuous air leakage finally recommend placement claw adjacent nodule localization deeper heart-side nodule within lung tissue often lead unnecessarily deep wedge resection may distort lobe compromise lung function make anatomic resection complicated limitation study retrospective
