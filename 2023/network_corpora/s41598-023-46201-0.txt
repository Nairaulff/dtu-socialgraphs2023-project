confirmed use nutritional supplement achieved mitigating negative effect heat stress result current study indicated mixture probiotic significantly improved performance heat-stressed broiler chicken general use probiotic clove essential oil additive showed significant improvement body weight gain feed conversion ratio compared control group current result consistent attia elbaz yin reported including probiotic dietary supplement improved productive performance term live body weight feed conversion rate similar finding attia reported dietary addition enhanced growth performance bird summer improved growth performance may due high potential combining probiotic enhances feed utilization general health including stimulating effect activity digestive enzyme antimicrobial antioxidant immunity addition broiler fed diet containing probiotic showed significant improvement growth performance may due synergistic effect probiotic enhancing gut health improving digestion absorption nutrient addition property phenolic compound alleviate thermal stress effect interesting noticeable improvement growth performance result effect dietary supplement carcass dressing carcass yield meanwhile addition probiotic reduced abdominal fat content however insignificant numerical increase carcass yield dressing may due improvement digestion absorption nutrient result supported many study indicate carcass percentage relative weight internal organ broiler chicken fed diet includes probiotic affected several study also confirmed adding live microbe broiler diet reduces carcass content abdominal fat explained effect adding probiotic reduction acetyl-coa carboxylase enzyme catalytic role synthesis fatty acid reduces lipogenesis low abdominal fat represents great economic benefit poultry industry abdominal fat main source waste excess fat slaughterhouse therefore low content abdominal fat carcass lead increased carcass yield increase total productivity slaughterhouse lack abdominal fat indicates beneficial effect experimental dietary supplement distribution fat carcass utilized distribution fatty acid muscle contributes improving carcass quality however still need study fatty acid composition carcass meat determine meat quality previous study documented beneficial effect probiotic essential oil nutrient digestibility broiler chicken similarly current study
