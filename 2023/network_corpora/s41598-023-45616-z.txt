three test different time compared first prior infection second acute phase infection third month acute phase significant difference found data three questionnaire contrast study found slightly improving qol decrease median total score pandemic may multiple reason found slightly improving qol related angioedematous symptom compared period prior pandemic one may ae-qol questionnaire evaluate week completion certainty recall period increase doe bias test reason improving qol may study analyzed second third wave covid-19 hungary similar lockdown restriction first wave may possible time people approach sars-cov-2 restriction introduced due pandemic changed resulting situation caused fear uncertainty conclusion study investigated significantly high number hae patient analyzing course covid-19 also vaccination sars-cov-2 pose specific risk hae patient including vector based live attenuated well mrna vaccine knowledge also first study investigated covid-19 hae patient hungarian population based research assume sars-cov-2 similarly infection may induce hae attack certain case course mostly similarly severe attack patient used treated successfully well although median age 44.5 analyzed hae population underwent sars-cov-2 infection endangered age group number infected patient population small patient comorbidity internal medicine based received result seems hae doe aggravate acute infection sars-cov-2 infection furthermore despite limitation survey propose since hae attack occurring acute phase infection always milder course two disease aggravate course despite overlap pathomechanisms survey patient hae attack occurred acute side effect sars-cov-2 vaccine patient day administration vaccine established neither mrna vector based live attenuated sars-cov-2 vaccine pose higher risk c1-inh-hae patient average population according patient availability hae physician hae medication change analyzed pandemic period since significant difference attack number prior pandemic find significant difference qol two period finding study indicate second third wave hungarian covid-19 epidemic significantly influence clinical picture c1-inh-hae
