introduction one main problem studying transfer parameter radionuclides heavy metal organ product originating animal wild livestock extensive range transfer data e.g concentration ratio transfer factor case difference great four order magnitude even though one main factor behind could source intake water soil forage parameters—e.g duration ingestion radionuclide specie soil composition macro trace element diet characteristic feature animal like age productivity etc.—might also significant studying contribution factor uncertainty evaluation concentration ratio transfer factor could solve problem concerning wide range data point available crucial predictive modeling biomonitoring contribution importance unintentionally ingested soil contaminated radionuclides previously addressed study
