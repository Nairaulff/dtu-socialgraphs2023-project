however research correlation digitalization traditional industrial upgrading yellow river basin still theoretical level different conclusion relatively scattered present china critical period industrial upgrading transformation old new driving force economic structure moreover digitalization become important starting point promoting high-quality development china economy context clarifying relationship digitalization traditional industrial upgrading help promote upgrading industrial structure yellow river basin effectively achieve high-quality economic development china particular accordance provincial panel data yellow river basin paper firstly constructed coupling coordination model digitalization traditional industrial upgrading secondly coupling coordination degree relative

conclusion drawn follows coupling coordination degree digitalization traditional industrial upgrading yellow river basin continuously optimized however traditional industrial upgrading yellow river basin lag behind digital level two match study period digitalization level traditional industrial upgrading level coupling coordination degree gradually increased relative development degree gradually decreased whole coupling coordination degree digitalization traditional industrial upgrading yellow river basin gradually experienced transformation process disordered state disordered state

industrial ecological upgrading increase impact digitalization level however short term improvement level digital application improve traditional industrial upgrading upgrading function increase impact digital level implication according conclusion transformation traditional industrial upgrading yellow river basin relatively backward level coupling coordination digitalization traditional industrial upgrading high basis clarifying development pain point traditional industry different region yellow river basin government improve law regulation institutional system soon possible reduce cost digital transformation traditional industrial enterprise first government provide financial subsidy tax incentive traditional industrial enterprise investment digital transformation encourage enterprise accelerate pace intensity digital transformation second government guide government fund type social capital actively support development digital economy grant project funding enterprise independently research develop digital software promote key research pilot application industrial software technology third government speed construction digital integrated application platform driving supporting role digital high-tech artificial intelligence blockchain cloud computing big data internet thing high-quality development traditional advantageous industry transportation manufacturing yellow river basin promoted traditional industrial enterprise one hand focus promoting application digital technology practice concept application digital management whole process product design production planning manufacturing process organization service addition also pay attention promoting transformation upgrading upstream downstream enterprise ultimately achieve double upgrading industrial chain value chain hand necessary strengthen digital vocational training talent needed various industry standardize evaluation criterion digital talent accelerate formation talent

transformation according conclusion conclusion significant difference coupling coordination degree digitalization traditional industrial upgrading among province yellow river basin one hand developed province region play leading role improving coupling coordination level digitalization traditional industrial upgrading yellow river basin present sichuan shandong two major province yellow river basin driving role obvious seriously affect collaborative upgrading mechanism coupling level digitalization traditional industrial upgrading province yellow river basin yellow river basin gradually strengthen advantage large city first promote development three state-level urban cluster namely shandong peninsula central plain guanzhong second give full play guiding role leading city zhengzhou qingdao jinan 'an hand positive spatial correlation coupling coordination level different region therefore government focus improving reality spatial spillover effect digital traditional industrial upgrading weak province strengthen demonstration effect digital development spillover effect industrial chain province within basin specifically government combine resource endowment condition social market need technological condition different region first government accelerate effective flow efficient agglomeration regional production factor increase regional interactive digital sharing center build mutually beneficial digital ecosystem second government improve digital economy industrial chain promote digital integration yellow river basin third government jointly improve efficiency regional resource allocation enhance value traditional industrial chain guide digital development traditional industry example due help traditional industry expand function reduce cost improve efficiency increase power necessary build digital service platform industrial interconnection global awareness combination regional industrial layout provide supporting platform high-quality collaborative development traditional industry province yellow river basin although relevant viewpoint proposed paper supported theoretical practical data still area improved due time level research example research dimension paper limited yellow river basin necessary carry comparative study important economic zone china beijing-tianjin-hebei region yangtze river economic belt guangdong-hong kong-macao greater bay area yangtze river delta addition factor affecting relationship digitalization traditional industrial upgrading fully considered example coupling coordinated development two
