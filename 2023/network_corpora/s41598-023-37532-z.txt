introduction childhood glaucoma account 4–18 cause blindness child disease includes two type pathogenesis primary congenital glaucoma associated primary maldevelopment trabecular meshwork secondary glaucoma aqueous outflow reduced due ocular systemic disease elevated intraocular pressure iop lead visual dysfunction damaging optic nerve causing corneal scarring also cause cosmetic disfigurement globe enlargement buphthalmos corneal opacity hydrophthalmos avoid irreversible sequela important identify affected child early stage diagnosis childhood glaucoma involves multiple diagnostic method tonometry funduscopy gonioscopy case general anesthesia required child may cooperate exam identification external symptom crucial first step diagnostic process motivate performing exam childhood glaucoma characterized three typical sign photophobia blepharospasm tearing however non-specific sign may absent misinterpreted parent caregiver primary physician furthermore mild bilateral enlargement globe corneal opacity may unnoticed resulting delayed diagnosis consultation childhood glaucoma specialist month even year last decade advance made use deep learning detect pediatric
