introduction biological invasion refers kind specie certain distribution abundance country region outside origin capable breeding offspring causing damage natural community ecosystem invaded area become one five major global environmental change twenty-first century biological invasion destroys original ecosystem invaded area also threatens local economic development invasive plant important group invasive organism assimilate resource needed local plant complex competition inhibits survival reproduction local plant pose serious threat local biodiversity xanthium italicum first discovered china annual invasive weed compositae native north america widely distributed america europe asia oceania due strong adaptability high seed production fast growth high dispersal ability easy form dominant specie invaded community resulting decline even extinction native plant italicum spread throughout many chinese province liaoning shandong hebei shaanxi xinjiang presently brought serious
