also planned compare outcome individual noacs verify whether edoxaban associated better outcome presumed latest guideline study lacked statistical power undergo analysis third due small number major

concomitant anticoagulation anti-tb treatment difference risk use noac warfarin negligible fourth inr level available database could ass time therapeutic range warfarin user last due retrospective observational nature study study provide causal relationship caution interpreting result despite limitation believe study practical value considering randomized clinical trial regarding issue unlikely
