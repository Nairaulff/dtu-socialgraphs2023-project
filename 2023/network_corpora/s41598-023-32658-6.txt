developing condition defined listed introduction chapter early detection myocardial function impairment still challenging furthermore child ventricular arrhythmia usually primary disease diagnosis left ventricular dysfunction irreversible consequence appear enables proper therapeutic intervention may substantially improve prognosis study found diastolic function parameter disturbed despite normal left ventricular systolic function suggests diastolic function disturbance precede systolic myocardial impairment pvc patient among parameter obvious child ventricular arrhythmia left atrial enlargement functional disturbance expressed strain parameter reservoir contractile strain left atrial enlargement already described adult pvc study park indexed left atrial volume correlated statistically significantly arrhythmia burden pediatric population contrary study park correlation arrhythmia burden left atrial parameter weak statistically significant several explanation discrepancy firstly cited data degree linear correlation pvc burden left atrial size could stronger despite larger study population patient patient secondly cited trial performed relatively old population mean age year compared mean age year left atrial size reflecting left ventricular filling pressure may relate pvc burden also low compliance myocardium due degeneration could extent empower increased filling pressure associated ventricular arrhythmia furthermore found statistically significant difference control patient regarding left atrial strain variable cut-off limit left atrial strain child established meaning finding uncertain detailed evaluation bigger cohort would detect cut-off limit left atrial strain pvc child shed light clinical value finding elongation deceleration time edt study group suggests ventricular diastolic dysfunction disease initial stage general edt preservation closely connected diastolic function impairment severity adult elongation edt often seen physiological process due gradual decline myocardial compliance age young human reflects early diastolic left ventricular stiffness due mildly impaired relaxation pseudo-normal mildly reduced edt sign concomitant concentric left ventricular hypertrophy markedly reduced edt mean restrictive filling advanced diastolic dysfunction patient elongation edt probably observed reflection mild relaxation disturbance speculate patient long-term follow-up diastolic function would deteriorate leading irreversible stiffness ventricle proper antiarrhythmic treatment performed point isovolumetric relaxation time ivrt analysis confirms hypothesis ivrt also found elongated population best knowledge never described literature concerning pvc child increase relates early diastolic dysfunction many disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy arterial hypertension diabetes pvc child consequence dyssynchronous contraction due arrhythmia lead natural way dyssynchronous relaxation dyssynchronous myocardial activation seen premature beat occurs also sinus rhythm neighboring premature contraction probably normalizes gradually beat neighboring beat remote pvc evidence last assumption doe exist literature need investigation still could explain ivrt relates arrhythmia burden patient another diastolic function parameter disturbed adolescent pvc e/e ratio significantly higher case control e/e primary factor reflecting filling pressure left ventricle according guideline become one essential noninvasive diastolic function parameter result concordant study salem significantly higher adult pvc control moreover recent trial found statistically significant correlation exercise capacity e/e elevated filling pressure left ventricle strictly related low exercise capacity many disease e.g. aortic stenosis atrial fibrillation diabetes considering data may assume high e/e child pvc may reflect increased filling pressure probably doe normalize effort directly influence exercise capacity another possible explanation dyssynchronous contraction primary factor connected low exercise capacity diastolic filling pressure meaningful exertion tolerance pvc patient assume analysis using detailed hemodynamic evaluation e.g. stress echocardiography would help explain mechanism low exercise capacity young individual ventricular heart rhythm disturbance conclusion left ventricular diastolic function impaired deteriorates arrhythmia burden increase pvc child ventricular arrhythmia young individual may related exercise capacity decrease due left ventricular filling pressure elevation
