five prevalent hpv genotype differed among group considering detection single mixed infection fact previous study showed hpv genotype differ term period clearance woman mixed infection longer time clear infection compared single infection increasing number sex partner could contribute persistence since increase risk acquiring new hpv genotype study vaginal microbiota demonstrated association gardnerella spp persistent hrhpv infection well progression cervical lesion result association gardnerella spp persistence progression hrhpv usik proposed addition role gardnerella spp viral persistence also contributes disruption vaginal microbiota increased bacterial diversity also lead persistence progression hpv infection recently demonstrated newly described specie gardnerella produce sialidase therefore studying presence sialidase encoding gene gardnerella important paving way study focusing role individual gardnerella hpv infection persistence best knowledge first study ass relationship hrhpv persistence infection load nanh3 gene known sialidases hydrolyze sialic acid host epithelial cell provides carbon source gardnerella allowing uptake catabolism expose binding site facilitating bacterial adhesion epithelium biofilms formation sialidases still cleave mucin oligosaccharide decreased cervicovaginal mucus viscosity compromising physical biochemical barrier pathogen besides sialidases compromise immune barrier hydrolyzing immunoglobulin present study result quantification nanh3 differ included hrhpv infection grouped however load nanh3 higher cervicovaginal fluid woman hpv16 persistent study reporting association altered vaginal microbiota hpv infection despite mechanism influence hpv infection remain unknow known lactobacillus spp produce several microbicidal factor including lactic acid important agent acidify vaginal environment control overgrowth bacteria preventing stis difference nanh3 load found hpv16 infection intriguing needed new approach involving vaginal microbiota hpv16 since genotype responsible case high-grade intraepithelial lesion invasive cervical carcinoma human papillomaviruses modulate host immune response blocking immune-related gene expression immune signaling pathway different genotype may act different pathway addition cervical microbiome cytokine profile showed notably different stage natural history cervical cancer thus bacterial specie may interact immune signaling hpv infection contributing persistence progression hand consequence hpv immune evasion imbalance vaginal microbiota due reduced amino acid source sustaining survival lactobacillus specie therefore association hpv seems bi-directional fact study showed stability vaginal microbiome necessary maintenance immune surveillance hpv16 clearance sense difference load nanh3 gene presence hpv16 lead hypothesize vaginal microenvironment would different modulation presence different genotype change immune response might create permissive microenvironment bacterial overgrowth gardnerella spp present virtually case frequent dysbiosis vaginal microbiota study association nanh3 gene observed robinson suggested

well increased sialidase level indeed sialidase activity cervicovaginal fluid already demonstrated presence microscopy-detected fact sialidase activity could promote growth colonization prevotella bacteroides well vaginalis vaginal bacterial sialidase producer production sialidase important step biofilm formation mechanism reinforces role gardnerella spp scaffold vaginal mucosa attachment bacterial specie start form biofilm condition already associated refractory treatment persistence bv-associated bacteria treatment although amount sialidase-encoding nanh3 gene differ clearance persistence presence hrhpv infection load high persistent group difference among group considering hpv16 infection limitation analysis due low sample size stratifying genotype furthermore result
