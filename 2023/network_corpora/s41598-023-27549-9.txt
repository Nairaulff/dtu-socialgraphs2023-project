introduction knee osteoarthritis common osteopathic problem usually occurs among people aged year old prevalence knee increasing substantially around world due aging society damage loss articular cartilage remodeling subarticular bone formation osteophyte ligament laxity weakening periarticular muscle around knee joint characteristic occurring result disease progression knee tends cause significant burden affected including joint pain stiffness muscle weakness deficit often lead limitation movement functional activity large weight-bearing joint inability voluntary fully activate muscle well decreased muscle cross-sectional area contribute insufficient muscle strength lower extremity especially quadriceps hamstring gluteal complex previous study also found muscle weakness lower extremity main cause functional decline positively correlated degree disability therefore restoring muscle strength lower extremity important factor preventing deterioration physical activity
