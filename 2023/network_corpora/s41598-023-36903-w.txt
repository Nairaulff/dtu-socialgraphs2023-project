introduction urbanization one main driver global change biodiversity loss so-called biotic homogenization process however specie response urbanization varies many example animal adapting even flourishing habitat specie colonize urban habitat mostly show high degree environmental tolerance example term habitat breadth geographic range size although mechanism behind pattern remain poorly studied behavioural physiological ecological flexibility proposed explain ability organism tolerate disturbed habitat underlying assumption tolerant generalist specie composed individual capable exploiting full range available resource even adaptively shifting niche necessary allow cope highly modified habitat urban environment recent year growing number study showing generalist specie actually composed individual whose diet represent spectrum specialization within overall feeding resource population recognition difference among individual ecological niche exploitation implies within specie population individual segregate habitat and/or diet composition subject different selective force promote change frequency phenotype leading population divergence line result carrete
