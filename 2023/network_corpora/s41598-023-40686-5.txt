present study found decreased blood level gpx malaria patient compared uninfected individual meta-analysis revealed falciparum vivax infection associated diminished blood level gpx significant difference observed two infection falciparum generates breaking amino acid within acidic food vacuole process additionally lead generation toxic free-heme ferri/ferroprotoporphyrin mechanism

level antioxidant enzyme sod cat gpx indicate antioxidant level equally increased combat generation oxidative stress product subgroup meta-analysis revealed decreased reported gpx level study published contrast comparable gpx level observed study discrepancy may stem difference study location fact fewer study conducted compared period result conclusion regarding decreased gpx level likely robust reliable conclusion drawn earlier study additionally fewer publication gpx level conducted compared could contributed heterogeneity result subgroup meta-analysis variation level gpx different plasmodium specie infection revealed substantial gpx depletion seen patient falciparum malaria study included patient vivax malaria however direct comparison patient falciparum vivax malaria showed

study included direct comparison gpx patient vivax falciparum malaria regardless type plasmodium infection falciparum vivax infection could increase oxidative stress decrease antioxidant level nevertheless meta-analysis result suggest additional research required examine different plasmodium specie infection relate gpx level clinical status subgroup analysis revealed whereas gpx change study included symptomatic asymptomatic malaria patient decrease study included symptomatic patient mda measure oxidative stress considerably greater symptomatic malaria patient asymptomatic malaria patient people asymptomatic malaria may exhibit lower level oxidative stress gpx level lower patient high moderate parasitemia low parasitemia reason behind inverse correlation gpx level parasitemia

lower compared uninfected case previous meta-analysis study suggest possible positive correlation gpx sod another antioxidant enzyme cat rank among significant antioxidant performs similar function gpx sod three antioxidant enzyme gpx sod cat directly combat free radical like peroxynitrite hydroxyl perhydryl radical lessen reactivity lipid target forming oxidative stress hypothesized hyperlipidemia significantly contributes depletion gpx falciparum -infected erythrocyte regard anti-malarial drug therapy malaria patient reduces lipid peroxide level result significant restoration

remained subgroup analysis potentially limiting conclusion made meta-analysis difference gpx level plasmodium specie parasite density different level clinical severity could estimated effectively present study study investigated finding conclusion conclusion malaria associated reduced gpx level finding provides valuable insight prompt need investigate role gpx depletion malaria pathogenesis research necessary determine difference gpx level infection caused various plasmodium specie varying parasite density varying degree clinical severity given small number study included meta-analysis addition study required understand potential benefit anti-malarial medication combined gpx supplementation restoration antioxidant status varying clinical malaria case
