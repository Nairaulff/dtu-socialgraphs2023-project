introduction central venous catheterization frequently employed technique monitoring managing critically ill patient owing recent surge frequency hospital visit admission emergency room critically ill patient central line insertion commonly used continuous infusion ionotropic agent repeated blood sampling real-time monitoring consequently also increased incidence central line insertion-related side effect including mechanical problem pneumothorax remnant guidewire external puncture infectious problem negatively affect patient clinical outcome one complication central line-related bloodstream infection crbsi important cause nosocomial infection previous epidemiologic study reported crbsis still fairly common associated poor prognosis critically ill patient admitted intensive care unit icu study based patient admitted general ward reported infection staphylococcus aureus candida charlson comorbidity score independent risk factor 30-day mortality furthermore critically ill patient frequently visit stay emergency department may susceptible crbsi unique scenario associated difficulty maintaining sterile atmosphere frequent visit although several report incidence crbsi study lack statistical power small sample size therefore study performed single center retrospective cohort study evaluate incidence crbsi among patient receive central line insertion identify clinical factor

incidence nosocomial infection increasing ranging depending study population recent population-based study reported crbsi occurred 19.2 patient suspected systemic inflammatory response syndrome however limited data exploring incidence crbsi patient undergo catheter insertion although could collect detailed clinical data severity acute illness specific diagnosis indication central line

finding underscore importance effort place catheter single trial ultrasound-guided access reducing incidence crbsi saliba found staphylococcus specie common causative microorganism crbsi also observed study—notably staphylococcus epidermidis common staphylococcus aureus furthermore case longer maintenance catheterization usually day required endoluminal spread catheter hub known pathway infection colonization cutaneous pathogen along external skin catheter found main cause bacteremia study therefore sterilization effort strengthening infection bundle including hand hygiene aseptic skin preparation avoidance inappropriate insertion site must enforced reduce crbsi catheterization owing extensive research implementation aggressive monitoring management strategy patient suspected crbsi crbsi-associated mortality decreased considerably recent year nevertheless correlation occurrence crbsi greater mortality inconsistent similar previous study also found development crbsi independent risk factor in-hospital mortality hand retrospective cohort study revealed crbsi attributable factor increasing icu mortality multiple plausible explanation first characteristic study population quite different since age underlying illness severity active disease could affected mortality second management patient suspected crbsi including timing catheter removal selection empirical antibiotic identical accordingly future research must utilize randomized controlled study design provide high-level evidence association mortality crbsi limitation study single-centered retrospective study design limit generalizability result severity disease patient clinical profile expertise professional dispensing intervention would differ hospital moreover could exclude several hidden confounding factor sterile technique insertion manage include information additional treatment outside including central line change despite limitation strength study relatively large sample size patient
