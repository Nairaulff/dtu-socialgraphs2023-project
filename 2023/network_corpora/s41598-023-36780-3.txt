introduction massive uptake development deployment large-scale natural language generation nlg system recent month yielded almost unprecedented worldwide discussion future society chatgpt service serf web front-end gpt-3.5 gpt-4 fastest-growing service history break million user milestone january billion visit february driven upheaval particularly anticipated education knowledge transfer future generation conduct first independent systematic study ai-generated language content typically dealt high-school education argumentative essay i.e essay student discus position controversial topic collecting reflecting evidence e.g student taught cooperate compete learning write essay crucial aspect education student learn systematically ass reflect problem different perspective understanding capability generative perform task increase understanding skill model well challenge educator face come teaching crucial skill multitude individual example anecdotal evidence quality ai-generated content genre e.g paper first systematically ass quality human-written ai-generated argumentative text across different version chatgpt use fine-grained essay quality scoring rubric based content language mastery employ significant pool domain expert i.e high school teacher across discipline perform evaluation using computational linguistic method rigorous statistical analysis arrive several key finding model generate significantly higher-quality argumentative essay user essay-writing online forum frequented german high-school student across criterion scoring rubric chatgpt-4 chatgpt web interface gpt-4 model significantly outperforms chatgpt-3 chatgpt web interface gpt-3.5 default model respect logical structure language complexity vocabulary richness text linking writing style human generative model differ significantly instance gpt model use nominalizations higher sentence complexity signaling complex scientific language whereas student make use modal epistemic construction tend convey speaker attitude linguistic diversity nlg model seems improving time chatgpt-3 still significantly lower linguistic diversity human chatgpt-4 significantly higher diversity student work significantly beyond existing benchmark openai technical report gpt-4 present benchmark evaluation lack scientific rigor fails provide vital information like agreement raters doe report detail regarding criterion assessment extent statistical analysis conducted larger sample essay contrast benchmark provides first statistically rigorous systematic study essay quality paired computational linguistic analysis language employed human two different version chatgpt offering glance nlg model develop time work focused argumentative essay education genre also relevant beyond education general studying argumentative essay one important aspect understand good generative model conveying argument consequently persuasive writing general related work natural language generation recent interest generative model largely attributed public release chatgpt public interface form interactive chat based instructgpt model commonly referred gpt-3.5 comparison original gpt-3 similar generative large language model based transformer architecture like gpt-j model trained purely self-supervised manner e.g masked language modeling instead pipeline involved human-written content used fine-tune model

low-frequent grammatical construction like complex nested hierarchy self-embeddings another recent line research structure automatically generated language evaluated guo show question-answer scenario chatgpt-3 different linguistic device human zhao show chatgpt generates longer diverse response user apparently negative emotional state given aim identify certain linguistic characteristic human-written versus ai-generated content also draw related work field linguistic fingerprinting assumes human unique way using language express i.e linguistic mean employed communicate thought

however human yet familiar chatgpt-3 capable identifying ai-written answer time moreover author also find ai-generated output deemed helpful human answer slightly half case suggests strong result openai benchmark regarding capability generate free-text answer generalize beyond benchmark however indicator benchmark may overly optimistic assessment model capability example kortemeyer conduct

united state medical licensing exam usmle find model performs near passing threshold assessment bit optimistic kortemeyer state level performance comprehensible reasoning valid clinical insight suggest model chatgpt may potentially assist human learning clinical decision making frieder evaluate capability chatgpt-3 solving graduate-level mathematical task find chatgpt-3 seems mathematical
