people data vary developing country tbis still caused road traffic accident definition tbi state alteration brain function evidence brain damage caused external force definition recognises symptom brain damage may delayed even absent therefore evidence brain damage obtained analytically scan required sometimes sign brain damage delayed hour tbi complication appear day even week later fact one main concern associated cardiovascular respiratory endocrine complication may occur patient pathological finding tbi within day may suffer complication development chronic comorbidities tbi complicate
