attributed pathogenic variant two gene causing simultaneous occurrence one monogenic disease patient although combination inheritance mode autosomal x-linked recessive dominant observed co-occurrence two independent recessive condition particularly prevalent consanguineous family shown others surprising since consanguineous couple share significant proportion genome e.g 1/8 case first cousin likelihood shared carrier status one pathogenic recessive variant greatly increased indeed recently shown classic counseling consanguineous couple recurrence risk familial variant overlook small significant recurrence risk autosomal recessive variant even family history lacking therefore consanguinity may prompt search one disease-related gene family disease phenotype atypical especially challenging absence family relative different component phenotype segregate separately limitation study include limited number family member available ophthalmic examination addition evaluation family include anti-retinal antibody testing explore possibility autoimmune retinopathy could underlie rod dysfunction observed patient summary present first time co-occurrence pde6c -related cone dystrophy aps1 suggest ophthalmologist encounter unusual presentation disease well-established phenotypic spectrum consider possibility multilocus disease especially setting consanguinity
