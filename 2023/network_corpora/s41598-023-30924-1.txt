introduction bart hydrops fetalis homozygous α-thalassaemia severe thalassaemia foetus die either utero soon birth severe anaemia tissue hypoxia importantly mother affected foetus increased risk obstetric complication including severe preeclampsia dystocia postpartum haemorrhage due placentomegaly maternal mortality estimated nearly medical treatment affected pregnancy usually terminated associated maternal perinatal morbidity identification couple risk genetic counseling early prenatal diagnosis essential early decision avoid serious complication late gestation hence accurate diagnosis population screening important preventing controlling disease α-thalassaemia often caused deletion α-globin gene consequently reduced absent α-globin chain synthesis two copy α-globin gene located homologous chromosome contribute foetal adult haemoglobin thus variable number α-globin gene defect lead varying clinical manifestation foetus adult severe form α-globin gene abnormality
