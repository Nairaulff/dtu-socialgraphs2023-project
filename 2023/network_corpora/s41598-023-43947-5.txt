treatment option rising rapidly growing need reassess question treatment covid-19 broad clinical spectrum although infected individual experience mild subclinical disease approximately hospitalized covid-19 patient develop severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care according living world health organization guideline drug severe covid-19 corticosteroid il-6 receptor blocker tocilizumab sarilumab baricitinib janus kinase inhibitor strongly recommended favor whereas remdesivir conditionally recommended ruxolitinib tofacitinib considered neither baricitinib il-6 receptor blocker
