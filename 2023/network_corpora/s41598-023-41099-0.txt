behavioral survey month immediately geje conducted analyzed patient thyroid cancer alternatively effective dos msv estimated based number formation using lymphocyte however unlike analysis dic formation used estimate dose acute phase radiation exposure analysis formation susceptible long-term effect smoking drug natural radiation previous study revealed increase dic formation single scan impossible find significant increase formation theoretically produced equal ratio dic formation find accumulative increase formation three consecutive scan thought reason finding influence confounding factor especially subject middle-aged older conversely present subject young mean age approximately year therefore considered effect confounding factor small formation present study caused mainly radiation exposure majority might exposed msv regardless history examination based calibration curve 23-year-old healthy subject high compared external exposure dose estimated behavioral survey learned dose–response curve age-related difference formation even healthy subject accordingly suggests dose–response curve least every year might necessary therefore difficult determine radiation exposure msv based number formation significant feature present study rather performing comparison two group thyroid cancer healthy control group aberration frequency compared among three group included patient benign thyroid tumor thyroid-related disease thyroid cancer initially aberration frequency significantly higher patient thyroid cancer fig suspected due genetic instability proposed

body type adult although waza-ari could used estimate past exposure dos based specific detailed scanning site present study consider difference number examination scanning site following reason equipment differed facility thyroid cancer non-thyroid cancer patient including control subject multiple examination effective dose head frequently performed control subject lower scanning site waza-ari estimation radiation exposure dose msv based number formation difficult mentioned initial higher aberration frequency thyroid cancer group caused radiation exposure nuclear power plant accident frequency remained significantly higher group even adjusting history examination however significant difference among three group disappeared adjusting history examination furthermore subject study younger year age effect confounding factor considered small therefore consider examination greatest impact occurrence chromosomal translocation accordingly consider radiation exposure examination likely cause increased aberration frequency unfortunately external exposure dos based behavioral survey obtained resident thus insufficient result present subject inclusion study however evacuee behavioral survey record external exposure dose reported msv analysis representativeness individual external dos indicated lived area resident known exposure dos lived time geje exposure dose level resident known exposure dos therefore already reported relationship found occurrence pediatric thyroid cancer external exposure dos absorbed dos thyroid gland place residence result study support claim occurrence pediatric thyroid cancer caused radiation exposure due nuclear accident contrast present result suggest examination young people aged year induce increase lymphocyte formation previous study reported examination child increased risk cancer development especially brain tumor suggesting possibility dna chromosome damage due radiation exposure examination might responsible inducing chromosomal abnormality genetic mutation however pearce al. report state child needed undergo examination hand child cancer-predisposing factor pfs congenital genetic abnormality immunodeficiency excluded relationship examination risk developing cancer might suggest conversely child pfs would risk cancer development examination recent study reported radiation dose head neck examination age associated subsequent development brain tumor study 5-year observation period examination rule latent cancer time scan interest excess relative risk err brain tumor highest year lowest year since exposure therefore important minimize medical exposure examination especially young people conclusion analysis aberration frequency using lymphocyte indicator radiation exposure support claim evidence additional exposure without examination pediatric thyroid cancer patient compared control furthermore noted medical exposure scan child adolescent affect chromosome gene patient method
