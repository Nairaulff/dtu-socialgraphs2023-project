introduction fibromyalgia chronic diffuse dysfunctional pain syndrome affect around population western country systematic literature review epidemiologic study indicate fibromyalgia associated deterioration quality life increased mortality strong psychopathological comorbidity particularly depression although pathogenic mechanism fully explored literature suggests one main mechanism linked deregulation pain control different level nervous system according evidence-based recommendation optimal treatment requires transdisciplinary approach combining pharmacological non-pharmacological treatment including resuming physical activity however resuming adapted physical activity challenging patient clinical point view one hand patient often aware adapted physical activity crucial therapeutic process hand previous experience physical activity causing discomfort pain sustain vicious circle fear avoidance according fear avoidance model fam pain lead catastrophizing thinking movement activity develop excessive irrational debilitating fear movement kinesiophobia feeling one prone experience painful injury re-injury feeling might lead avoidance movement general physical activity avoidance turn lead fear spite lack consensus theoretical background pain catastrophizing i.e form abstract intrusive repetitive negative thinking difficult disengage rumination consequence physical activity negative affect pain seems one key mechanism involved process partial model rumination pain thus addressing rumination resuming physical activity patient might promising path improving adapted physical activity compliance consequently enhancing patient wellbeing although link pain rumination already shown several qualitative e.g. correlational review see experimental e.g. study impact rumination pain experimentally tested context physical activity rumination defined chain repetitive passive relatively uncontrollable thought focused negative content including pain consequence context might causal role decreasing physical activity chronic pain several reason one hand rumination shown associated higher pain intensity poorer therapeutic outcome neuroimaging study suggested rumination might linked impaired anticipatory treatment aversive stimulus related pain healthy population resulting exaggerated response pain mechanism might also potentially explain rumination affect avoidant behavior modifying expected outcome pain hand qualitative research along conclusion literature review suggest rumination might also triggered experience pain moreover seems patient chronic pain may positive metacognitive belief rumination—they tend think rumination might help cope serve problem solving strategy kind metacognitive belief might also mediate positive relation pain intensity catastrophizing additionally rumination theory shed light link rumination avoidance applied perspective chronic pain kinesiophobia watkins nolen-hoeksema suggest maladaptive abstract rumination might considered emotional avoidance disconnecting patient current experience mechanism might provide momentary relief deleterious long-term consequence e.g increasing depression and/or anxiety impairs emotion regulation might also linked deregulation level goal action identification i.e flexibly adjusting level abstract vs. concrete processing ongoing situation overuse abstract processing turn might result decreased general motivation commitment pursuing goal might particularly relevance context resuming adapted physical activity chronic pain patient moreover experiential avoidance i.e deliberate effort alter form frequency aversive experience negative emotion unwanted cognition experimentally shown reduce pain tolerance mechanism line patient positive metacognitive belief might explain rumination become preferential strategy pain regulation reduce use emotion regulation strategy distraction could considered effective strategy cope pain adaptive alternative rumination finally literature provides evidence rumination might mediator moderator certain risk factor pain e.g. gender pain anticipation maladaptive coping strategy functional disability pain furthermore rumination might play mediator role link pain psychological distress mediator pain depressive symptom non-clinical population suffering pain also mediate negative relation protective factor e.g mindfulness depression chronic pain patient thus addressing rumination patient might also potentially reduce risk comorbid psychological disorder sum use rumination respond discomfort daily physical activity might maintain higher pain exercise compared strategy e.g. distraction cognitive attentional process also impair long term emotion regulation mechanism experiential avoidance however direct impact rumination regulation strategy never previously tested experimental setting exploring path seems particularly appealing according recent study patient might prone ruminative style

discomfort rumination induction group word rumination interferes recovery physical activity term subjective pain compared patient using distraction result support partial model rumination chronic pain also line literature describing effect distraction pain however one interesting result study lack effect rumination vs. induction procedure patient affect positive negative result induction procedure pain affect taken together particularly appealing compared result experimental study brooke tested effect experimental procedure rumination versus distraction induction similar one used present study attentional pattern undergraduate student received threat-inducing information cold pressor task result suggests trial shorter exposition rumination induces bias toward stimulus linked pain trial longer exposition induces experiential avoidance behavior result alongside rumination literature might explain one hand rumination might increase subjective experience pain attentional focus interoceptive stimulus hand doe necessarily increase short term negative affect due experiential avoidance function attentional scope model rumination suggest individual engaging ruminative process struggle disengage attention rumination content additionally group study already shown also linked attentional bias toward pain stimulus trait rumination might modify treatment pain stimulus also non-clinical population moreover literature provides evidence pain might linked avoidance tendency present study rumination time may operate overly general abstract level processing might disconnect patient direct emotional experience even though still focused negative content–pain significance consequence overgeneralization might result short-term emotional relief also deregulates long-term emotion regulation sum rumination might enclose patient vicious circle attention sustainably focused pain stimulus experience overly general level preventing use adaptive emotion regulation strategy beyond aforementioned result study also opportunity test feasibility ecological pain activation procedure procedure never used fibromyalgia field activating pain understand evolution mechanism new idea research classically activation conducted using standardized laboratory procedure example activation c-fibers thermodes a-beta fiber pressure repeating localized nociceptive stimulation classical cold pressor task pain activation method may essential understand neurological mechanism involved processing nociception laboratory procedure nevertheless reflect chronic pain patient everyday life experience particular lack appropriate ecological context study order enable patient process pain experience cognitive level ecological setting used everyday-life activity patient regularly home working shopping etc participant agreed participate research compliant completed task either initial pain increased reached sixth floor record dropout physical activity allowed significant increase pain two group record adverse event procedure therefore ecological activity accessible easy set clinical situation make possible activate pain without using laboratory equipment one limitation present study measure rumination mrsi show significant difference distraction rumination group spite difference reported participant subjective pain intensity discomfort one possible explanation unexpected result choice momentary ruminative self-focus inventory although scale cited previous study tool measuring state rumination validation never published tool published modified version brief state rumination inventory—bsri unfortunately data collection present study started prior publication bsri alternative relevant solution might also use recently validated item assessing rumination ecological momentary assessment setting absence control group accounting spontaneous recovery pain also significant limitation present study constrains drawing conclusion causal role rumination maintenance pain particularly taking account distraction suggested positive effect pain recovery remains therefore unclear whether rumination really impairs pain recovery distraction effective method coping pain however control group seems difficult design especially given one hypothesize left without precise instruction patient use habitual regulation strategy thus designing passive control group kind experiment challenging definitely subject reflection study moreover one challenge study design reduce amount cognitive activity e.g. questionnaire fill physical activity rumination vs. distraction induction thus data patient affect physical activity induction evaluate whether patient emotional reactivity physical activity impact use rumination distraction would interesting consider future study alternative method evaluating affect would interfere rumination induction example passively collecting psychophysiological data additionally would interesting study take account maladaptive abstract form rumination also test impact adaptive concrete experiential rumination processing mode pain line processing mode theory study experimentally shown abstract versus concrete rumination might differential impact affect emotion regulation testing hypothesis context would particularly appealing light lack significant impact induction procedure affect present study hypothesize lack might linked emotional avoidance thus testing also concrete experiential processing mode might provide interesting insight role avoidance testing adaptive rumination mode comparing maladaptive rumination strategy e.g relaxation might also crucial perspective study suggesting distraction long term become problematic chronic pain also seen avoidance/escape strategy despite limitation result obtained relevant clinical point view suggest addressing rumination treatment could direct effect pain level also avoidance behavior thus rumination-focused treatment could potentially adapted management pain comorbidities fm—particularly given key element treatment gradually restart appropriate physical activity russel underlined patient may find great difficulty facing activity resumption may associated feeling loss decreased self-efficiency feeling loss result perceived discrepancy current condition past ability perception gap hypothesized trigger rumination process according control theory additionally study suggest kinesiophobia also linked higher level rumination therefore seems necessary support resumption physical activity also anticipating risk engaging rumination could alter physical activity benefit also patient self-efficiency moreover underlining role cognitive process training teacher adapted physical activity could limit risk post-activity rumination potentially reduce avoidance mechanism path seems particularly promising considering first study testing rumination-focused cognitive behavioral therapy chronic pain patient chronic low back pain suggests might reduce depression anxiety pain severity conclusion participant engage process rumination following physical activity seem recover pain experience compared engage distracting activity result endorse edward partial model rumination pain highlight causal role rumination development maintenance pain comorbidities causality confirmed larger study psychological physical treatment evolve better take account cognitive process pain maintenance
