introduction sarcopenia defined progressive systemic loss skeletal muscle mass strength physical performance adversely associate quality life qol clinical outcome clinical importance highlighted field chronic liver disease cld well various area clinical practice liver cirrhosis representative cause secondary sarcopenia caused something ageing e.g. chronic inflammatory disease diagnosis sarcopenia

reliable valid clinical tool commonly used ass muscle strength elderly people advantage grip strength include simple inexpensive quick repeatable tested limited space recent worldwide cohort study

list liver transplantation hcc patient treated systemic chemotherapy believe study able demonstrate grip strength useful skeletal muscle mass predicting mortality first decrease grip strength according severity liver disease greater skeletal muscle mass indeed decrease grip strength three time greater patient patient second grip strength loss prominent among sarcopenia-relevant factor patient third multiple regression analysis demonstrated independent factor associated decrease grip strength age associated decrease skeletal muscle mass loss result suggests grip strength directly affected cirrhosis skeletal muscle mass fourth skeletal muscle mass trunk likely decrease extremity grip strength even cirrhotic patient method measure skeletal muscle mass trunk often used ass skeletal muscle mass field liver disease however method reportedly reflective prognosis modality contrast decline grip strength particularly pronounced cirrhotic men study grip strength may thus significant impact overall prognosis especially male patient european working group sarcopenia older people ewgsop guideline state low muscle strength primary parameter sarcopenia muscle strength reliable measure muscle function furthermore awgs doe support concept pre-sarcopenia loss skeletal muscle mass due lack sufficient evidence regarding prognostic value finding seem compatible statement supporting practical value grip strength measurement assessing sarcopenia progression sarcopenia pronounced patient patient addition age-related skeletal muscle loss unique multifactorial mechanism including protein-energy malnutrition increased autophagy ubiquitin proteasome decreased serum testosterone growth hormone level hyperammonemia physical inactivity increased myostatin level lead sarcopenia indeed skeletal muscle loss rate increase progression cld patient child–pugh class relative change skeletal muscle volume per year reported 1.3 3.5 6.1 respectively regarding hcv-infected patient skeletal muscle loss frequent patient patient result consistent finding study men showed greater decline grip strength woman present study cross-sectional national survey independently

nutritional therapy exercise therapy recommended treatment sarcopenia due cirrhosis result study may helpful determining area resistance training focus example training leg vulnerable decline may need emphasized end important clarify age decline skeletal muscle mass accelerates patient cirrhosis body part research required several limitation associated present study warrant mention first single-center study relatively small sample size particular small number patient poor liver function malbi 2b/3 may contributed lack clear stratification rate change sarcopenia-relevant factor second unable standardize interval assessing sarcopenias however believe impact limitation minimal assessed patient 70.2 interval 1–2 year compared annualized change third may selection bias prevalence sarcopenia study lower others similar study lower prevalence may due exclusion patient advanced liver dysfunction initial subsequent assessment fourth bia method grip strength measurement associated several limitation bia method known overestimate skeletal muscle mass presence edema ascites frequently seen patient cirrhosis case obvious edema ascites excluded study mild case may included although grip strength commonly used index muscle strength study ass index muscle strength physical ability besides grip strength e.g. walking speed chair stand test past study shown muscle weakness varies sex
