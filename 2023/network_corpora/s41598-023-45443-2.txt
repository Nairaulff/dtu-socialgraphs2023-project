literature therefore finding intervention effectively improve post-resuscitation myocardial neuronal dysfunction critical patient prognosis cardiac dysfunction associated post-cpr syndrome characterized severe myocardial impairment global hypokinesia affecting success rate cardiopulmonary resuscitation cardiac function deterioration begin minute arrest peak within resuscitation reinforcing early intervention treatment proposed molecular mechanism post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction involve i/r injury resulting large amount oxygen free radical damage cell membrane induce myocyte necrosis apoptosis moreover intracellular accumulation occurs cytosolic overload action exchanger present sarcolemma membrane presence endogenous paracrine heart recently recognized

blood flow modulation sympathetic neurotransmission cardiac contractility stimulation cell hyperplasia hypertrophy addition repairing cardiovascular structure angiotensin interacts two pharmacologically distinct subtypes cell surface receptor type type ang receptor type receptor mediate main cardiovascular effect ang mechanism may explain significant difference found lower myocardial injury score gat1 group reported furthermore limiting influx sarcolemma ventricular fibrillation resuscitation prevents accumulation excess mitochondrial attenuates myocardial injury mechanism may explain significant reduction cardiac arrhythmia observed since difference cpr duration number defibrillation adrenaline dos group observed thus suggest action candesartan doe interfere reversal heart rhythm cpr however incidence cardiac arrhythmia one hour rosc higher control group drug could potentially affect reduction new arrhythmogenic trigger mechanism lead blockade angiotensin at1 receptor explaining higher survival animal gat1 group demonstrated previous study since retrospective study suggested high cumulative epinephrine dosage associated worse hemodynamic neurological outcome although may improve coronary perfusion increase vascular resistance promote initial rosc cpr effect may lead increased myocardial dysfunction occasionally severe toxic hyperadrenergic state post-resuscitation period based fact previous animal study shown using large dos sodium nitroprusside cpr significantly improved hemodynamics used simulated acls intervention hypothesis ara could behave similarly optimizing vital organ perfusion pressure redirecting blood flow brain thorax significantly improving myocardial perfusion facilitating spontaneous rosc finding brain histopathology point candesartan potential neuroprotector ischemic injury caused hyperactivation brain at1 receptor responsible harmful effect associated leading vasoconstriction cerebral blood flow decrease increased oxidative stress vulnerability ischemia addition promoting vascular tissue inflammation neurodegeneration exacerbation at2 stimulation counteracts mechanism therefore selective blocking at1

inhibitor ace inhibitor mechanism used hajjar demonstrating neurocognitive impairment elderly population used candesartan instead lisinopril regardless blood pressure control recently at2 receptor also linked neuroprotection especially stroke study shown pathological condition ischemic insult at2 receptor expression may upregulated speculated increased stimulation at2 receptor may responsible therapeutic effect observed at1 receptor antagonism also shown coadministration at2 receptor antagonist decrease potential neuroprotection conferred candesartan irbesartan animal model cerebral artery occlusion clearly demonstrating at2 receptor activation contributed effect at1 receptor antagonist also supported fact at2 receptor-deficient mouse larger infarct volume poorer neurological outcome stroke study lack group at2 receptor antagonism making unclear whether neuro- cardioprotective effect due at1 receptor antagonism could at2 stimulation limitation study investigation needed clear question metabolic analysis i/r gat1 group lower level acidosis base intake group suggesting combination adrenaline candesartan protect myocardial tissue improve energy metabolism rosc since candesartan one potent aldosterone suppressor higher potassium level implicated lower rosc rate expected higher potassium level gat1 however potassium level lower min rosc infer finding might
