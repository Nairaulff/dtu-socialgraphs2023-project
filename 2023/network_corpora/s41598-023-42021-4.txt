introduction iran located arid semi-arid area country includes area wild specie valuable genetic resource term desired trait breeding program include trait related tree fruit accordingly using plant resistant weather condition prioritized also valuable feature resistance biotic abiotic stress evident specie used breeding program improve domesticated plant diversity wild specie fruit tree iran considerable reserve rich almond specie specie whose distribution reported endemic wild specie almond high survival water shortage due characteristic defoliation hot season high ability absorption storage water useful feature drought resistance evident breeding program also specie grow shallow rocky soil sometimes grow rock wild specie almond used iran since year ago rootstock almond related specie different region iran including hormozgan bushehr kerman far province many orchard almond grafted onto wild-related specie wild almond specie used economics ecology kernel oil used local people addition wild almond specie play role physical soil protection high ability prevent soil erosion resistance wild almond specie hot dry weather condition well salinity cold stress high important characteristic valuable gene pool late late-blooming self-fertilization dwarfing therefore important genetic resource used future breeding program landscape reforestation also used air purification polluted area one wild almond specie widely distributed throughout iran prunus scoparia spach schneid fig wild specie multi-purpose importance important use rootstock domesticated almond also used stabilize prevent soil erosion arid semi-arid region high resistance drought stress infertile soil dense green canopy beautiful flower long-lasting green branch long flowering period make plant

within among population variation due cross-pollination natural hybridization cross-incompatibility propagation seed gene flow exchange plant material study area traditional method propagation distribution almond seed caused differentiation trait increased diversity time also exchange almond germplasm done country millennium due communication interaction caused interbreeding population thus possible justify grouping accession distant population also dissimilarity accession specie denotes capability generating new progeny producing different association segregation gene thereby facilitating partial removal former linkage creation new one applied classical modern breeding method generate new progeny subsequent generation new linkage group new population property common practice use distant genotype frost resistance major breeding goal almond cultivar many production area early flowering time late winter early spring accession scoparia showed late flowering time possibility use almond related specie late-flowering date high chilling requirement develop new cultivar late-flowering would reduce frost damage reduce disease damage flowering delayed beyond rainy season would allow efficient use increasingly scarce insect pollinator conclusion wide range variation detected within among population studied scoparia obtained result important management protection
