introduction diabetic retinopathy one common microvascular complication diabetes mellitus leading cause visual impairment blindness global working-age population predicted number patient reach million

interaction test work however mechanism association bun level prevalence type diabetic patient yet clear bun level often elevated patient diabetes nephropathy suggesting bun may important indicator impaired renal function disturbed glucose homeostasis prolonged hyperglycemia triggered excessive oxidative stress subsequently leaded inflammation microvascular endothelial dysfunction common pathophysiological mechanism either may develop along therefore elevated level bun tended suggest presence moreover bun closely related catabolic activity human body thus elevated level may reflect decrease circulation status hypercoagulable oxidative stress microvascular hypoperfusion oxidative stress important mechanism development may account elevated level bun patient investigating subgroup analysis extremely important scientific studie unfortunately previous research tended performed partial subgroup analysis rather test interaction would hinder exploration true relationship bun probability subgroup analysis study participant divided two group according median level duration year found bun positively associated probability group figure show probability short duration group

could explained insensitivity bun change caused microvascular endothelial dysfunction prolonged hyperpermeability patient long duration kawasaki also found incidence increased rapidly type diabetic patient duration year may remind strengthen management follow-up patient duration year actively intervene bun level resist development potential mechanism among bun duration need elaborated research novelty work presented linear association bun probability form curve fitting also found joint effect bun duration probability certainly limitation study first study analytical cross-sectional study thus provided weak evidence exposure outcome making difficult elaborate causality second population study southern chinese patient type diabetes conclusion applied caution population type diabetes region third could observe association bun fundus lesion due limit original data lastly use medication considered effect development however secondary analysis based publicly available database lacking variable use medication led failure adjustment drug use conclusion found positive association bun probability patient type diabetes association stronger patient shorter finally must emphasize finding simply hypothesis-generating prospective research required confirm finding
