intervention potential change ocular blood flow strabismus surgery always captivating ophthalmologist anterior segment eye supplied anterior ciliary artery long posterior ciliary artery former account 70–80 whole blood supply strabismus surgery anterior ciliary artery transected thus speculated hemodynamic change may happen eye surgery early work attempted potential hemodynamic change via different

design stringent ruled factor might affect chorioretinal microcirculation choroid thickness much possible systemic disease smoking drug alcohol abuse caffeine-containing product physical exercise diurnal variation choroid study suggests recession–resection surgery horizontal strabismus significantly impact microcirculation retina early postoperative period however choroidal thickening found

increase represented increase total according cvv total increased time could cvi remain constant inferred csv also increased otherwise cvi would remain unchanged possible explanation phenomenon periocular inflammation choroidal thickening cataract surgery widely reported postoperative inflammation considered important cause besides many inflammatory disorder known lead choroidal thickening thus likely increase following strabismus surgery resulted postoperative inflammation suture material used strabismus surgery reported cause postoperative inflammation besides surgical procedure would inevitably cause damage blood vessel muscle resulting series reaction secretion proinflammatory cytokine activation neutrophil vasodilatation increase vascular permeability fluid exudation happen via complex immune cascade dilation choroid vessel would explain increase cvv whereas higher vascular permeability could contribute elevated fluid exudation vessel stroma causing increased csv simultaneous rise csv cvv resulted increased constant cvi observed study although research needed verify hypothesis study several limitation first single-center study limited number patient thus study larger sample size needed another limitation evaluated retinal choroidal microcirculation one week surgery thus long-term effect recession–resection surgery horizontal strabismus retina choroid need study finally since included patient horizontal strabismus esotropia exotropia possible difference two type horizontal strabismus may overlooked would interesting topic future exploratory work acknowledge limitation result may offer new insight dispute whether chorioretinal change exist strabismus surgery conclusion summary showed recession–resection surgery horizontal strabismus significantly impact microcirculation retina early postoperative period however choroidal thickening happened case constant cvi likely due postoperative inflammation study longer follow-up needed investigate long-term effect recession–resection strabismus surgery retina choroid
