introduction striped hyena hyaena hyaena hyena large-bodied facultative nocturnal scavenger across range specie occurs mostly open habitat arid semi-arid environment hyena considered globally near threatened international union conservation nature iucn red list reported decreasing global population trend however regionally middle east classified vulnerable conservation point view specie described one experience ongoing deliberate incidental persecution coupled decrease prey base may come close meeting continuing decline next three generation main cause projection abhorrence specie among human including plethora superstitious belief e.g. grave robber and/or damage agriculture livestock therefore surprising various type systemic institutional action plan implemented reduce hyena population israel specie experienced extreme population decline owing either targeted accidental poisoning especially susceptible scavenging behavior historically widespread throughout country nineteenth century also common however driven verge extinction turn twentieth century consequence two temporal geographically extensive incident poising occurred israel—the first british mandate authority placed strychnine poisoned donkey carcass order control golden jackal canis aureus try prevent rabies process also killed large number hyena second israeli authority 1950s 1960s assorted extensive poisoning campaign resulting many specie either going regionally extinct greatly reduced population 1970s estimated population consisted individual i.e. density israel area 22,145 0.06 hyenas/100 1990s estimated population size negev desert estimated 0.016/km beginning twenty-first century according israeli red book population size estimated individual i.e. 0.09/100 however hadad estimated population individual 0.18/100 revised number 0.45/100 specie persecuted indiscriminately west bank wherein killed body part considered medicinal value killed range superstitious belief connected underworld hence striped hyena population israel west bank second half twentieth century reported relatively low number owing uncertainty status hyena israel different level human ecological pressure experience across length country based 47-year time series data developed temporal geographic model population trend specie israel hypothesized termination targeted persecution authority first half twentieth century rapid urbanization central northern israel would conducive reviving local hyena population allowing largest carnivore country interacts frequently human conservation

arid region israel appears overcome environmental restriction present occupies habitat also appear overcome fear human become human commensal discovered observation near urban agglomeration assume may due two reasons—first increased hyena activity specific area owing access anthropogenic food base extensive area human habitation agriculture accompanied large quantity garbage dump resulting commensal carnivore population increasing greatly also increase body size also reported hyena furthermore establishing feeding station restaurant scavenger allowed access food carnivore including hyena second reason high activity hyena near urban agglomeration may due methodological artifact higher human activity reporting observed animal urban area open area ilani reported israel hyena either non-existent extremely rare 10–25 wide area along mediterranean coastline rafiah gaza strip rosh hanikra border lebanon also inland jezreel valley lower galilee region specie also existed low number upper galilee golan height gilboa mountain south along rift valley number small stable middle east country status hyena range vulnerable critically endangered including endangered israel however one careful changing status higher e.g. based population growth trend obtained population number mainly dependent habitat fragmentation optimal habitat human persecution form poisoning illegal wildlife trade retaliatory killing collection sexual organ traditional medicine result disproportionately large rate mortality road kill climate change also appears influence hyena population influence israeli population remains unknown solutionis similar ilani country-wide monitoring survey elucidate actual regional density reassess specie status authority ensure continued persistence viable population israel necessary despite use complex analytical procedure independent evaluation estimation still risk under- overestimating population size study based archival data albeit correct present based observation regular survey assumption two hyena sighting within year distance belong individual may potentially misleading given hyena exhibit complex social structure however approach solution ensure population estimated correctly came conclusion heuristic review data point lying apart supposed area single individual furthermore described degree interaction individual despite may vary season something yet described specie thus clear evidence exists hyena sighting away belong two individual next assignment post-hoc observation analytical square predictive procedure also generate random distortion avoided kind citizen science especially since data come period almost year year change people awareness advanced technological capability allowed improved observation e.g. smartphone application reporting system dramatically increased number report filed however also resulted individual reported year ability discern however matter level underestimation doubt hyena population increasing israel indirectly ground-proofed number road-kills study specific region extensive fieldwork ground-proofing almost 4-decades support conclusion judea region central israel mentioned earlier benign behavior hyena fact endanger human resulted region tolerated point become human commensal suspect also led lower perception risk hyena requires study speculate rapid population growth consequence intensification human development—whether building new town city expanding old one introducing new road infrastructure increasing acreage agricultural silvicultural area furthermore agricultural industrial intensification produce much organic waste desert region hyena exploit also semi-arid region bedouin allow livestock forage winter result abundance domestic prey readily available hyena extinction leopard panthera pardus nimr essentially leaf hyena largest carnivora country minimal intra-specific competition similar shamon also found highest density hyena carmel mountain northern israel assume probably result increase prey availability agricultural pest region subsequent human-wildlife conflict hunter contracted kill many wild boar sus scorfa golden jackal canis aureus possible whose carcass removed rich resource allowed foraging carnivore including hyena establish substantial population within relatively small area quickly however unlike panda unable elucidate competitive inter- intra-specific interaction carnivore result show israel hyena density 2.1 individuals/100 central kenya estimated minimum density 0.3 adults/100 estimate neighboring lebanon 0.11/100 several study also conducted striped hyena density central india 0.45/100 gir national park gujarat western india 0.7/100 however highest density observed kumbhakgarh 6.5/100 esrana 3.7/100 well ranthambore tiger reserve 5.5/100 sawai mansingh wildlife sanctuary 12.0/100 conclusion present recent evaluation hyena population israel west bank demonstrate specie appears recovered dramatically previous poisoning episode despite persecuted certain region specific ethnic group rebounded impressively hyena learned exploit human waste afraid human however coexistence wild hyena population human must treated caution proximity human habitation lack fear human result undesired conflict future similar occurring mount carmel region wild boar relevant authority must indulge education program explaining danger contact wildlife feeding ensure public health susceptible hyena population monitored expansion human exploitation authority must try nullify anthropogenic influence hyena high density evaluate environment actual carrying capacity large carnivore ramification study also projected area specie distribution help specie persist wild across range
