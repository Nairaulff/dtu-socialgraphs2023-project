world health organization recognizes neonatal hypothermia one major risk factor morbidity mortality newborn thermoneutral environment ensures optimum temperature maintain minimal basal metabolic rate ensuring neonate expends energy growth maintaining temperature india prevalence hypothermia varies normal newborn reported recently community hospital setting around respectively mainly included normal-weight newborn prevalence neonatal hypothermia higher low birth weight infant lbwi preterm newborn twenty-seven million infant born india every year million low birth weight infant lbwi preterm
