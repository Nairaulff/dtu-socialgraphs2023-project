introduction worldwide tuberculosis considered leading cause premature death among hiv/aids patient tuberculosis caused mycobacterium tuberculosis mainly affect lung also affect body part brain kidney spine hiv coinfection prime risk factor developing active high-burden setting turn increase susceptibility primary infection reinfection risk reactivation patient latent mycobacterium tuberculosis also negative effect immune response hiv accelerating progression hiv infection aid furthermore risk developing among people living hiv plhivs time higher general population according 10.6 million people estimated affected worldwide 1.6 million death recorded including 187,000 hiv-positive people according report sub-saharan africa home people living hiv/tb co-infection world uganda among high burden country country accounted new case recommends isoniazid preventive therapy intensified case finding infection control three main strategy prevention among people living hiv study shown ipt significantly lower incidence among plhiv completion month period treatment however uptake ipt relatively low developing country including uganda information enrolment retention challenge faced loss follow completion prevalence treatment period documented however hardly study documenting prevalence among plhiv completed ipt therapy associated predisposing factor hence study method study design

among plhivs sub-saharan africa including uganda risk developing among people living hiv plhivs higher general population therefore strongly recommends use isoniazid preventive therapy among plhivs fight incidence addition infection control active case finding number study reported ipt significantly reduces incidence among plhiv completion month period treatment study recorded prevalence 5.8 among plhiv completed month period ipt treatment lower 8.1 9.0 reported respectively study conducted ethiopia difference might attributed different study design sampling technique used study reported similar finding lower incidence rate among plhiv completed ipt therapy ipt therapy study observed female higher completion rate ipt compared male counterpart agreement study butebo uganda reported female higher uptake ipt compared male 33.8 although disease higher male 9.8 female 3.2 study gender important predictor disease prevalence similarly reported previous study observed study adherence counselling important predictor reduced likelihood disease occurence concurs previous study ethiopia uganda pre-counselling hiv client prior enrolment ipt significantly improved ipt uptake completion hence preventing active although study provides baseline evidence regarding prevalence predisposing factor active among plhiv ipt finding used affirm administration ipt plhiv effectively reduced occurrence control group plhiv completed ipt included comparative analysis prevalence active ipt also determined conclusion study observed considerably low prevalence among plhiv undergone ipt counselling noted significant predictor prevention active among hiv patient therefore addition recommended 3is consistent counselling pre treatment emphasized ensuring effectiveness ipt among plhiv
