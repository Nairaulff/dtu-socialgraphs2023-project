new home dog need time adapt stress-related parameter significantly decreased time shelter adoption showing form adaptation shelter new home however response higher shelter adoption dog returned normal i.e control group response level quicker new home shelter suggests shelter environment challenging dog novel home environment different word novelty shelter environment cause stress response two main component explain response first shelter environment might novel stimulus home environment unfamiliar people shelter routine differs home routine home routine might differ unfamiliar noise another reason could specific intense stressor shelter environment present home loud noise e.g. barking dog unfamiliar smell urinate defecate living space exercise attention etc example adam johnson found dog woke due barking dog responded barking sound common urban sound also social isolation spatial restriction stressor dog importantly stressor may different per shelter shelter vary greatly regarding environment management routine depending available resource instance addition two potential explanation combined effect factor might contribute well example social separation previous attachment figure entering shelter quite stressful new owner may time provide emotional support shelter staff dog may spend time alone especially first period new home shelter adoption important early identify individual hard time adapting provide strategy support transition shelter and/or new home example providing human interaction shown decrease stress level sheltered dog providing quiet comfortable resting hiding place may also support dog adapting shown sheltered cat hiding box reduced acute stress least day earlier cat without hiding opportunity furthermore result highlight relevance considering alternative option rehome dog example community rehoming prevent dog stay shelter especially important dog unlikely tolerate shelter stay prolonged disturbed deprived resting sleep useful measure monitor adaptation also negative physical mental consequence therefore welfare risk dog shelter dog might get drowsy irritable due lack rest like sleep deprived human influence react shelter staff new owner sleep deprived laboratory dog showed behavioural change including increased inactivity time spent laying standing inactive increased display maintenance behaviour decreased play alert behaviour relationship sleep deprivation behaviour mental state sheltered dog need study may impact welfare dog also relationship shelter staff matching potential adopter adoption

influence response dog relinquishment type kennel history largest effect parameter dog known history kennel environment significantly active night lower uccrs dog unknown kennel history shelter adoption implies kennel experience might help dog adapt faster shelter environment stray dog lower stress response shelter relinquished dog concurrent previous finding reflected hair cortisol mean relinquished dog kennel history highest risk showing longer pronounced stress response similar effect previous kennel experience stray relinquished home environment reported however study find effect previous kennel experience effect habituating dog kennel environment therefore need investigation positive practical application prepare dog stay kennel environment later life prior positive training example socialisation period addition found main effect weight class uccr level shelter adoption smaller dog 10–20 higher cortisol level larger dog 20–30 higher cortisol level smaller dog described uccr salivary hair plasma several potential explanation given ranging physical reason like mass-specific metabolic rate little creatinine production smaller dog due muscle mass mental reason like higher stress vulnerability small dog shelter due socialisation training smaller breed result study pinpoint hypothesis uccr level higher smaller dog general therefore physical reason found overall effect interaction time one limitation shelter study life history dog intake generally unknown especially early life experience huge impact development behaviour individual ability adapt novel

behavioural problem affiliated life history might therefore represent average dog population another limitation study due handling dog sample collection dog included study interaction human generally dog shelter would might influenced stress response instance dog taken kennel often urine collection fitting collar accelerometer weighing dog scale interaction human known decrease stress level sheltered dog might therefore influenced result even though aimed minimize effect keeping handling moment minimum interact dog necessary smooth sample collection conclude accelerometer-derived
