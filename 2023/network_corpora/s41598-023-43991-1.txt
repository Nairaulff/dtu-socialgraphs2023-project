introduction urban air pollution recognized major factor harm human health due increase morbidity mortality cardiovascular respiratory disease cancer diabetes systemic implication worsening chronic disease addition compromising integrity environment world health organization warns world population life place air pollution rate recommended limit main air pollutant particulate matter gaseous pollutant effect human health depend external factor concentration pollutant atmosphere body characteristic defense individual respiratory immune system estimated air pollutant contribute approximately million annual death worldwide including 300,000 death among child year age loss life expectancy approximately year brazil cohen reported 50,000 death secondary air pollution although author reported 100,000 death period among child adolescent numerous association reported environmental concentration pollutant asthma wheezing allergic rhinitis pneumonia loss lung function estimated new case asthma among child adolescent associated exposure 150,000 case occurring brazil paraguay california usa study included child showed exposure particulate matter increased prevalence respiratory symptom medication use among asthmatic child compared child without asthma emphasizing susceptibility patient asthma systematic review also showed increase risk pneumonia among child exposed exposure pregnancy also related impaired neonatal outcome prematurity low birth weight studied influence exposure first two year life age group respiratory system still developing disease

increase atmospheric associated increase risk death acute exposure also corresponded increased los acute subchronic exposure previous study found literature influence subchronic exposure respiratory health infant importantly precursor range secondary pollutant sequence photochemical reaction initiated solar radiation produce oxidant converted ammonium salt forming organic particle nitrate sulfate compose thus association found present study may partially reflect influence severity arf outcome greater severity exposure pollutant day dry weather noteworthy dispersion atmospheric pollutant smaller condition present study influence temperature marked acute subchronic exposure greatest severity arf observed high exposure so2 hot weather influence relevant since positive association severity low- high-rh situation study design allow in-depth analysis influence temperature since factor rainfall wind index also interfere smaller number individual comorbidities may impaired comparison infant without comorbidities nevertheless situation statistically significant association observed group greater acute exposure associated greater increase hospitalization time among comorbidities notably higher acute exposure associated increase day hospitalization among child comorbidities subchronic exposure associated almost increase risk death according previous study presence chronic disease increase susceptibility deleterious effect air pollutant adult fewer study effect air pollution child comorbidities rosenquist suggested child allergic asthma susceptible effect 2.5 child nonallergic asthma study also reported greater vulnerability child rheumatological disease hand result draw attention serious effect air pollution health previously healthy child sample size design study allow comparative analysis different etiology arf future study may propose association considering etiology due nature database clinical information missing however lack information correlated exposure unlikely bias toward one side affecting size estimate conclusion result contribute characterization possible effect urban air pollution health infant higher atmospheric concentration pollutant studied associated greater severity arf especially period hot dry weather
