introduction intravitreal injection medication particularly anti-vascular endothelial growth factor anti-vegf currently considered one common procedure medicine treat disease neovascular age-related macular degeneration diabetic macular edema general treatment minimal side effect good safety profile however post-injection endophthalmitis always major concern due devastating visual outcome although incidence endophthalmitis post intravitreal treatment reported vary 0.004 0.036 great effort employed reduce risk infection much possible number study evaluated potential risk factor intravitreal injection-related endophthalmitis oropharyngeal droplet transmission one major risk factor previous study suggested streptococcus spp. one respiratory tract microbe associated poor endophthalmitis outcome reason several protocol talking physician wearing face mask policy recommended covid-19 pandemic face mask wearing become general routine decrease risk coronavirus infection however concern face mask used patient may increase oropharyngeal bacterial dispersion toward eye due upward air flow breathing speaking several experiment suggested taping superior rim mask using n95 face mask could reduce upward air flow bacterial dispersion many ophthalmology center including center siriraj hospital sterile fenestrated surgical drape opening periorbital area employed cover patient face giving intravitreal injection keep area sterile increase awareness serious procedure physician patient although significant evidence routine use drape could reduce endophthalmitis rate hand similar face mask fenestrated surgical drape covering nose mouth opening periorbital area potentially increase air flow pharyngeal bacterial dispersion toward periorbital area intravitreal

covid-19 pandemic become general practice many hospital wear face mask physician patient recent study found increased air leak superior rim face mask raised concern increasing periorbital oropharyngeal bacterial dispersion patient face mask post-intravitreal injection endophthalmitis risk however still lack data regarding periorbital air leak bacterial dispersion relating fenestrated surgical drape study addressed issue demonstrated using fenestrated surgical drape either reusable cloth drape disposable drape lead bacterial growth agar plate simulated intravitreal injection condition combination using drape properly worn patient surgical mask tight-fitting also affect bacterial growth however speaking patient significantly associated periorbital bacterial dispersion according result wearing tight-fitting surgical mask patient showed significant impact periorbital bacterial growth compared mask silent speaking condition moreover taping superior edge surgical mask seal gap mask nasal bridge show significant difference bacterial dispersion compared taping recently patel found significant difference bacterial dispersion wearing tight-fitting surgical mask mask similar study however find significant reduction periorbital bacterial dispersion taping top edge surgical mask compared taping different facial anatomy asian subject study caucasian subject study might partly explain discordant result reavis also find significant reduction bacterial dispersion taping superior aspect surgical mask another study showed reduced air particle count indicating exhaled bacterial flora contamination top cloth mask speaking condition taping top edge cloth mask however air particle count detected taping condition surgical mask cloth mask different taping based piece evidence although taping patient face mask could reduce exhaled air jet toward periocular area might clinical importance term bacterial contamination moreover study previous data provide significant evidence patient face mask surgical cloth mask associated bacterial dispersion wearing mask support result recent large multicenter retrospective study involving 500,000 injection also suggested universal face mask wearing intravitreal injection associated risk post-injection endophthalmitis large scale cohort would required definitely address issue although would challenging conduct given low incidence post-injection endophthalmitis common bacterial strain identified staphylococci spp micrococcus luteus found similar proportion experiment control agar plate consistent fact staphylococci micrococcus common bacteria found indoor air environment demonstrated importance including control agar plate experiment interestingly streptococci well-known oropharyngeal microbiota associated severe post-injection endophthalmitis identified speaking experiment scenario emphasized importance keeping silence intravitreal injection procedure study particle settled agar plate captured active air sampling employed able detect particle suspended air however believed approach reasonable detect bacteria oropharyngeal droplet study active air sampling would interesting corroborate result 2-min exposure time chosen scenario represent duration fenestrated surgical drape covering face patient undergoing actual intravitreal injection exposure time also employed study investigating bacterial dispersion using blood agar plate limitation study sample size small although range study investigating periorbital bacterial dispersion owing fact post-injection endophthalmitis event rare bacterial dispersion chosen surrogate outcome presence might necessarily translated clinical endophthalmitis tight-fitting surgical mask investigated since loose-fitting standard practice would difficult control facial anatomy facial hair controlled although subject thai ethnicity facial hair participant study relatively young healthy result might generalizable patient poor oral hygiene respiratory infection using mask plus surgical drape could cause perception suffocation old patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease study older diseased individual would useful however study uniquely focused use fenestrated surgical drape careful study measure including presence room control agar plate internal control agar plate every scenario randomization scenario sequence washout period scenario masking outcome assessor employed minimize study bias much possible conclusion study suggested general using fenestrated surgical drape either reusable cloth drape disposable drape alter periorbital bacterial growth blood agar plate result also support patient surgical mask associated periorbital bacterial dispersion refraining talking intravitreal injection procedure remained crucial factor minimize oropharyngeal bacterial dispersion
