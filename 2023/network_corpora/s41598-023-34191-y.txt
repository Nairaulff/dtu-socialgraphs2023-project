introduction thalassemia common hereditary blood disease causing anemia worldwide reduced absent production either α-like β-like globin chain form hemoglobin tetramers fetal postnatal life main characteristic disease identified common chronic genetic disease world health organization country especially mediterranean region middle east southeast asia interestingly million people worldwide carrier hemoglobin disorder million southeast asia example bangladesh one member southeast asia population million population β-thalassemia carrier hemoglobin hbe carrier prevalence rate β-thalassemia hemoglobin hbe 4.1 6.1 respectively thus thalassemia becomes severe public health concern affect patient negatively previous study demonstrated thalassemia cause severe clinical physical social psychological complication instance poor physical health result deformity growth issue delayed puberty bone abnormality short height also reported suffered psychological social behavior abnormality low self-esteem depressive symptom stress anxiety poor social communication inadequate school functioning furthermore treatment process involves repeated blood draw multiple transfusion routine subcutaneous injection oral iron chelator therapy affect daily life consequently thalassemia reduces hrqol therefore predisposing factor determining hrqol might provide roadmap mitigating problem evidence-based information common thalassemia patient psychological social financial deficit yet emerge holistic welfare chronic patient include varied support initiative alongside clinical

discussion significant finding study hrqol male patient vulnerable compared female overall hrqol associated lower income high blood transfusion status disease severity comorbidities medical expense majority transfusion dependent comorbidities low-income family bangladesh low-middle-income country world bank data bangladesh lower middle income|data n.d. low income high medical expense high blood transfusion frequency significantly affect hrqol evidence previous study reported household income negatively impacted hrqol summary score thalassemia patient higher income scored higher physical health mental health total quality life score lower income low income also associated lower score physical health mental health outcome total sf-36 score low income high medical cost affect hrqol thalassemia patient several way firstly low income lead reduced access healthcare facility limited disease management resource physical mental health outcome financial barrier prevent seeking necessary treatment time resulting physical psychological health outcome deteriorating quality life furthermore thalassemic patient require lifetime treatment requires high blood transfusion iron chelation therapy laboratory testing associated expense affecting life satisfaction quality life addition increased medical cost cause significant financial strain leading stress anxiety poor quality life thalassemia patient family high blood transfusion frequency significantly affect hrqol however significant association found transfusion frequency reported high blood transfusion frequency another factor impact hrqol thalassemia patient regular blood transfusion essential maintaining health thalassemia patient also lead complication iron overload negatively impacting organ function physical health outcome furthermore frequent transfusion time-consuming require patient take time work school affecting daily routine social interaction reducing hrqol score clinician policymakers aware factor address improve hrqol outcome thalassemia patient addition patient comorbidities including cardiological disorder diabetes mellitus hepatitis related complication presence comorbidities independent factor lower physical health summary score overall quality life patient reportedly thalassemic patient comorbid medical condition demonstrated substantially impaired reduced hrqol comorbidities attributed increased burden managing multiple health condition including frequent medical visit increased healthcare cost potential adverse effect medicine moreover comorbidities may lead increased complication worsening symptom thalassemia reducing physical health qol patient study showed participant suffered e/β-thalassemia half participant severe form disease approximately transfusion dependent domain hrqol compromised patient thalassemia addition poor iron chelating therapy compliance also associated poor physical health mental health total sf-36 score finding showed age negatively correlated quality life among patient thalassemia statistically significant previous study stated similar observation due disease-related complication social psychological challenge age negatively correlated quality life qol thalassemia patient elderly thalassemia patient may experience reduced mobility social isolation anxiety related disease progression decreased resilience coping mechanism older thalassemia patient lower qol score younger patient disease-related comorbidities complication potentially explaining finding significant difference mental physical health male female however men scored higher woman one scale bodily pain 0.002 previous study south-west iran observed significant association gender overall quality life however observation echoed earlier study reporting gender correlated overall hrqol mental physical health score one possible explanation gender-related difference hrqol health outcome among thalassemia patient could related difference disease severity research shown male thalassemia tend severe symptom require frequent transfusion female could lead significant impact physical health quality life statistically significant association observed index family type marital status education level economic class hrqol finding consistent previous study suggesting married person scored higher mental physical health several possible explanation marital status may associated higher health-related quality life hrqol score thalassemia patient firstly marriage may offer emotional support sense belonging positively affecting mental health overall well-being secondly spouse may provide practical assistance treatment adherence management illness lead better physical health outcome lastly married individual may greater access social financial resource also positively impact hrqol factor suggest marital status essential consideration healthcare provider managing well-being thalassemia patient ensuring unmarried patient receive appropriate support resource address challenge living illness essential however education level significantly associated many aspect hrqol earlier research however insignificant income correlated physical health mental health quality life score impact income level health-related quality life hrqol thalassemia patient may attributed several factor firstly cost thalassemia treatment involves frequent medical intervention including blood transfusion iron chelation therapy may financially demanding low-income patient consequently financial burden may lead poor adherence treatment resulting exacerbation symptom deterioration physical mental health secondly patient low income may experience social emotional stress may adversely affect mental health overall quality life logistic regression analysis demonstrated comorbidities significant predictor hrqol however finding inconsistent previous study indicating comorbid condition thalassemic patient significantly associated overall quality life clinical characteristic clinical subtype disease severity splenectomy status blood transfusion iron-chelating therapy showed significant association mental physical health component nonetheless evidence showed patient severe disease condition history splenectomy receiving frequent transfusion iron-chelating medication significantly poor hrqol score contribution factor disease severity history splenectomy regular blood transfusion iron chelation therapy poor health-related quality life hrqol thalassemia patient attributed several reason firstly severe disease condition may cause physical emotional stress leading decline hrqol secondly history splenectomy may increase likelihood developing infection complication impacting hrqol thirdly frequent blood transfusion iron chelation therapy may time-consuming costly resulting side effect pain discomfort fatigue negatively impact hrqol thalassemia fatal patient appropriately treated however outlook thalassemia remarkably transformed recent year life-threatening deadly disease chronic illness disability clinical management improved extensively recent year even developing country however minimal attempt made uplift quality life among patient thus assessing hrqol patient thalassemia crucial identifying factor lead poor quality life addition physical mental health issue out-pocket expenditure treating thalassemia cause financial social problem may lead poor quality life poor chance leading happy life thus patient require physical rehabilitation psychosocial support network give hope better future policymakers field pay special attention patient comorbid condition poor compliance iron chelating therapy lower socio-economic status improve 'quality life qol addition family member support overcoming mental health issue besides physical illness however nationwide research needed depict real scenario regarding quality life thalassemia patient present study single-center cross-sectional study thus nationally representative data conclusion finding study highlighted significant negative impact thalassemia treatment hrqol term comorbidities poor iron chelating therapy poor income study suggested modifying existing thalassemia management care could beneficial psychosocial counseling program aimed helping patient discus accept illness facilitating normal lifestyle providing link patient school official family physician might help alleviate difficulty especially academic performance addition modification health care service child thalassemia become patient-centered flexible comprehensive reduces time spent hospital improves treatment outcome including hrqol patient future several potential therapy could significantly impact treating thalassemia patient gene therapy stem cell therapy promising therapy developing treatment thalassemia therapy potential offer long-term cure reduce need blood transfusion improve quality life patient thalassemia patient must stay informed work healthcare provider explore available treatment option available
