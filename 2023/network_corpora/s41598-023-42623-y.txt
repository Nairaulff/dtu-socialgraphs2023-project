introduction colorectal cancer crc third common malignancy worldwide second common cause cancer-related death future estimated global burden crc increase resulting 2.2 million new patient 1.1 million death modifiable risk factor including alcohol intake smoking obesity poor diet physical inactivity widely recognized known risk factor crc addition gut microbiota emerged recent year important risk factor crc receiving increasing attention recent year suggested escherichia coli phylogenetic group genomic island called polyketide synthetase pks coli might involved development crc pks coli encodes genotoxin colibactin induces dna damage cell cycle arrest mutation chromosomal instability eukaryotic cell indeed result previous meta-analysis demonstrated crc odds ratio 2.3 pks coli carrier compared non-carriers addition since small molecule inhibitor targeting colibactin production reported prevent tumorigenesis mouse model strategy reduce prevalence pks coli could lead prevention crc physical activity serf crucial preventive measure colorectal cancer crc meta-analysis shown high level associated reduced risk crc compared low level furthermore recent finding indicate gut microbiota may play pivotal role mediating relationship reduced risk crc development key factor understanding mechanism underlying preventive effect crc short-chain fatty acid scfas metabolite produced specific gut microbiota scfas generated fermentation dietary fiber gut microbiota serve energy source intestinal epithelial cell anti-inflammatory ph-regulating gut motility-enhancing barrier function-enhancing antineoplastic property colonic condition scfas notably inhibit growth pathosymbiont coli suppress virulence gene including genotoxicity-associated pks gene cluster recent meta-analysis revealed lower fecal scfa concentration correlate higher risk incidence crc associated increase scfa-producing bacteria elevate fecal scfa concentration thus regular might deter colonization proliferation pks coli enhancing scfa production although previous study provide important insight reducing prevalence pks coli several knowledge gap exist first knowledge study examined association pks coli thus remains unclear whether related second study suggest excessive could adverse effect gut microbiota specifically prolonged high-intensity exercise reported decrease diversity gut microbiota increase inflammatory bacteria optimal amount intensity remains unknown therefore intensity dose–response relationship pks coli also evaluated furthermore beneficial effect pks coli

many participant study may engaged high level according data published japanese ministry health labour welfare average step-count per day japanese adult male female whereas average step-count per day participant study 10,634 male female data shown therefore possible participant study likely engaged general japanese population association prevalence pks coli low may underestimated initially postulated scfas might partially mediate relationship pks coli however mediation analysis result support anticipated association among scfas pks coli notably existing literature doe unanimously

factor obesity study focusing community-dwelling older adult insomnia lower pal gauged accelerometer exhibited higher fecal scfa concentration another recent investigation revealed inverse

tumorigenesis prevention questioned researcher given diverse finding evident relationship among scfas pks coli complex warrant investigation future study aim provide clearer understanding intricate interplay among factor although study suggested negative effect excess gut microbiota result seem indicate higher level associated increased induction pks coli finding gastrointestinal disorder

therefore level general public engaged considered harmful enough increase prevalence pks coli previously reported green tea intake stool pattern associated pks coli prevalence japanese population result study may suggest influence prevalence pks coli weaker dietary stool factor development crc solely attributable presence pks coli numerous factor contribute risk crc including diet genetics lifestyle previous study indicated inverse association crc incidence suggesting might influence crc risk various mechanism regulation inflammation apoptosis growth factor axis immunity epigenetic factor reported underlying mechanism association lower crc risk although fully understood study examined association pks coli prevalence one risk factor crc based finding alone would premature conclude doe influence prevalence pks coli finding observational preliminary requiring cautious interpretation research study several limitation mentioned firstly due cross-sectional design infer causality observed association secondly sample size pose concern highlighted discussion study may lack statistical power detect subtle association prevalence pks coli third sex distribution skewed female participant comprising cohort stratified analysis sex might shed light potential influence sex association however study insufficient statistical power perform stratified analysis sex future research involving larger balanced sample instrumental clarifying association lastly study employ random selection participant city indicating potential selection bias conclusion pks coli new risk
