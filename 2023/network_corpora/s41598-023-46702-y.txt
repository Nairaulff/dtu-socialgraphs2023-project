complication disease addressing requires integrated approach focus direct treatment also encompasses broader preventive post-care strategy especially vulnerable geriatric population hospitalisation trend treatment protocol regarding patient hospitalisation observed trend towards shorter length stay throughout study period although occasional fluctuation older patient generally required longer inpatient treatment minimum average length stay remained significantly two week attributed widely implemented standard protocol two-week intravenous i.v antibiotic therapy integral component conservative surgical treatment approach detailed guideline regarding duration i.v antibiotic therapy typically necessitates prolonged inpatient care currently absent german american spondylodiscitis
