introduction issue water sanitation hygiene wash remains global public health problem outlined sustainable development goal sdgs however wash problem may pronounced population affected war conflict globally million people displaced forced flee country due armed conflict crisis people risk infrastructure collapse food insecurity unsafe water inadequate water supply sanitation particularly affecting woman child achieving universal access safely managed water service require 23-fold increase current rate progress ninefold increase sanitation fivefold increase hygiene according world health organization inadequate wash contributes 842,000 death low middle-income country accounting death diarrheal disease unsafe inadequate drinking-water lead death inadequate sanitation lead 280,000 death inadequate hand washing lead 297,000 death year approximately 525,000 child age five die diarrheal disease study show number under-five death indirectly attributable conflict three five time higher number directly attributable death ethiopia improvement wash service hampered various humanitarian situation large-scale internal displacement people political tension conflict mobilization worsen security situation country pre-war period various wash project implemented tigray region one wash national program reduce wash-related mortality morbidity november drastic war

main finding present study show high prevalence diarrhoeal disease among child war tigray ethiopia majority household relied unimproved drinking water source unimproved sanitation facility hygiene practice also poor menstrual hygiene material available war tigray ethiopia prevalence diarrhoeal disease child one year age higher present study 25.5 pre-war survey 10.2 result consistent study conducted flood prone settlement conflict however result present study higher study conducted community difference could explained war study service affected compared study conducted normal circumstance higher prevalence diarrhoeal disease child found household visited hews household visited hews frequency home visit hews lower war pre-war study health extension program flagship program government ethiopia launched gregorian calendar health sector development program hsdp â€“ii targeting household provide health promotion preventive service community grassroots end 38,000 hews

role reducing burden diarrhoeal disease hews able carry work either resettled migrated died due war tigray evidence suggests scaling health extension program reduces child morbidity mortality due diarrhoeal disease low frequency household visit hews make difficult follow hygiene environmental sanitation program health package community result reported high prevalence diarrhoeal disease among child may exacerbated neglected role hews community health promotion disease prevention large number household reported relaying unimproved water source resulted higher prevalence diarrhoeal disease among child present study finding consistent result another study unimproved water source one identified predictor diarrhoeal disease percentage household relying unimproved water source higher regional socioeconomic survey study also showed quarter water source reported functional time study rest non-functional could due direct damage water source lack maintenance lack budgetary resource non-functioning water source could force people search unimproved water source leading morbidity mortality war-related damage various water source believed affect functionality water source tigray damage water source could indicate use water blockade weapon war observed elsewhere found 17.3 respondent use water treatment method household indicating majority household still water treatment facility could lead waterborne disease study shown effective consistent use household water treatment safe storage reduces waterborne disease diarrhoeal disease depending type water supply however study examined source drinking water war examine household access drinking water could potential research topic future prevalence diarrhoeal disease higher household relied unimproved sanitation provision improved sanitation facility lower war survey well documented lack improved sanitation lead diarrhoeal disease provision improved sanitation safe water shown successful method improving maternal new-born health conflict situation percentage hand washing practice 14.5 lower pre-war figure 47.5 low- middle-income country promotion hand washing resulted decrease diarrhoeal disease among child year age however higher prevalence diarrhoeal disease among child may due poor wash service war-torn tigray improved water sanitation hygiene measure shown reduce burden diarrhoeal disease child access menstrual hygiene material reportedly available 22.1 war menstrual hygiene critical lack access menstrual hygiene material negatively impact health well-being dignity woman girl lack improved water supply sanitation access menstrual hygiene material tigray burden woman girl impact health dignity well-being strength limitation study study strength limitation large sample size covering woredas six zone tigray increase validity result large sample size reduces sampling error increase representativeness addition majority respondent female provides relevant information wash prevalence diarrhoeal disease among child activity also burden woman child due socially constructed task assignment woman use pretested standardized questionnaire inclusion supervisor also increase validity result knowledge first study conducted ass wash war tigray ethiopia however study also limitation result study based cross-sectional design limitation cross-sectional study inconclusive cause effect relationship wash diarrhoeal disease child respondent sociodemographic data collected study fear study participant willingness sociodemographic factor considered study could confounding factor diarrhoeal illness child exclusion western tigray study could also affect nature overall result study also examine access drinking water supply prevalence diarrhoeal disease child older one year age examined study addition prevalence diarrhoeal disease child eight- month war particularly siege tigray studied known believed affect service wash burden diarrhoeal disease wash related disease community conclusion overall result study show war tigray ethiopia frequency home visit health extension worker low water sanitation service improved prevalence diarrhoeal disease among child high addition zonal difference selected wash indicator prevalence diarrhoeal disease child based finding study better access improved water sanitation service recommended prevent high prevalence diarrhoeal disease among child war-torn tigray ethiopia collaborative effort also needed engage health extension worker provide promotive preventive service war affected community tigray ethiopia comprehensive survey household child one year age recommended ass access wash burden wash associated disease
