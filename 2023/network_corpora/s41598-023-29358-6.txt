introduction quality water paramount importance survival health human well flora fauna one determinant life however quality developed well developing country greatly uneven may reflect economic social physiological status although country water shortage problem poor water quality issue well known development industry urbanization inappropriate agriculture practice ever-expanding population etc. damaged freshwater resource discharging effluent runoff dumping waste islam determined trace metal deep surface water korotoa river bangladesh rizwan detected toxic metal concentration different environmental matrix emet stream basin one important river system turkey polluted harmancik chromium mine chromium level water basin fish capoeta tinca squalius cii barbu oligolepis found higher prescribed limit water quality issue curtailed periodic systematic surveillance present investigation undertaken check degraded water quality narora channel narora 27° 30′ 0.00 78° 25′ 48.00 district bulandshahar uttar pradesh india surveillance narora channel quite important emerges middle ganga reach extends narora district ballia narora channel supply water almost entire village crop field narora adjacent area investigation found poor water quality ganga river different reach however knowledge investigation made channel region ganga river narora channel receive waste industrial domestic source solid garbage directly thrown mass bathing clothes washing defecation etc heavy metal form common group persistent non-biodegradable waste presence heavy metal water affect quality water also make unfit drinking use economic loss well limit upgradation living standard native community everywhere clean drinking water short supply village therefore local community depends natural freshwater resource need reason become quite supreme take organized step check quality water water quality index wqi help interpretation water quality associating complex data giving rise score report water quality status moreover living organism wqi utilized bio-indicators monitor effect pollution fish chief organism freshwater ecosystem therefore health status show quality water also fact heavy metal cause stress overcome stress fish utilize energy reserve like carbohydrate fat protein moreover depletion upregulation energy reserve impacted body index hepatosomatic index etc recently samim vasim highlighted change haematological variable like hemoglobin concentration count blood cell oxygen-carrying capacity etc due pollution tokatli find high amount heavy metal gala lake turkey help diatom fish bioindicators furthermore inhabiting flora also represents bioaccumulation heavy metal different part translocation shoot restricted however heavy metal amount increase root may beyond 100,000 time surrounding water since aquatic plant bioaccumulate heavy metal hence utilized check pollution freshwater body eichhornia crassipes common freshwater tropical subtropical plant almost decade back crassipes cultured ornamentation purpose however spread fast rate found suitable ambiance http tosummaryofinvasiveness withstand extreme condition temperature toxic substance etc present investigation area study rural residing community native depend entirely natural freshwater resource drinking purpose therefore target discus suitability narora channel water consumption local domestic based wqi physicochemical variable moreover accumulation endemic fish bagarius bagarius crassipes plant also utilized bio-indicators narora channel fish bagarius carnivore fish feed zooplankton mollusc insect even piscivore besides also show antisocial behavior captivity also known name devil fish prefers live fast flowing water furthermore fish condition index metal pollution index mpi harmful impact heavy metal energy source glucose glycogen protein amount measured addition bioaccumulation factor baf translocation factor mobility factor also measured crassipes since resident investigated area also professional fisherman catch fish channel hence human health risk assessment also evaluated result discussion analytical method validation result precision study relative standard deviation rsd

crossing limit contributing poor quality furthermore wqi calculation give insight overall quality water explains combined effect several physicochemical property calculation done simply converting numerous variable water quality single number addition wqi simplifies data help clarifying water quality issue combining complex data producing score show status water quality wqi classifies water quality status five group wqi indicates excellent quality wqi 50–100 designates good quality wqi 100–200 show poor quality wqi 200–300 reflects inferior quality wqi unfit drinking current study wqi calculated 4124.83 fall set wqi group wqi result show narora channel water investigated rural area unsuitable drinking well domestic purpose high wqi value narora channel water could correlated prof main culprit due high value 885.04 3196.26 respectively lead high consequently high wqi high content may due effluent several type source like sugarcane iron factory cement dust mechanical workshop agricultural activity etc near bank drain partial untreated effluent channel waste domestic source contribute pollution upper ganga region brijghat narora poor water quality reported prasad tabrez also found high wqi kshipra river dewas segment madhya pradesh india giao reported worse quality water low-lying area vietnamese mekong delta rural well urban region india also meet national guideline water quality natural freshwater resource furthermore rural region colombian caribbean represent poor water quality investigation highlighting water quality problem become meaningful integrated assessment adverse impact health outcome bio-indicator organism inhabiting ambiance therefore endemic fish bagarius plant crassipes chosen investigation table water quality property narora channel
