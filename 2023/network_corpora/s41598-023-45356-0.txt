introduction due explosive increase availability digital content demand computer efficiently handle textual data never greater large amount data improved computing power enabled vast amount research natural language processing nlp goal nlp allow computer program interpret process unstructured text computer text represented string reality human language much richer string people relate text various concept based previously acquired knowledge effectively interpret meaning text computer must access considerable knowledge base related domain topic semantic network represent human knowledge computer first proposed quillian 1960s semantic mean relating meaning language logic semantic network graph representation structured knowledge network composed node represent concept e.g word phrase link represent semantic relation node link tuples format source semantic relation destination encode knowledge example information car wheel represented car wheel figure show toy example semantic

application instance google introduced google knowledge graph enhance search engine result knowledge graph specific type semantic network relation type explicit voice assistant digital intelligence service apple siri ibm watson use semantic network knowledge base retrieving information result machine process information raw text comprehend unstructured user input achieve goal communicating user
