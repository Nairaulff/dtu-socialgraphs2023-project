introduction obesity considered one severe health problem worldwide obesity affect wide range systemic disease including asthma obesity identified risk factor poor asthma control several mechanism obesity affect asthma identified clinical data indicated reduced response inhaled corticosteroid obese asthmatic patient vivo finding also shown asthmatic patient overweight obese show steroid resistance adult onset-type obese asthma characterized elevated oxidative stress level female predominance lower serum immunoglobulin ige level infrequent antigen-specific ige antibody detection poor quality life asthma symptom considering existing knowledge regarding characteristic obese asthma widely considered adult asthmatic patient obesity characterised non-type-2-inflammation however clinical setting several adult obese asthmatic patient higher serum ige level peripheral blood eosinophilia furthermore sputum interleukin level obese adult asthma higher participant normal weight addition mepolizumab monoclonal antibody il-5 omalizumab monoclonal antibody human ige improved control severe asthma obesity thus may another phenotype adult obese asthma addition previously reported

asthma patient gina therapy step 4â€“5 showed significant number obese asthmatic patient positive type-2 inflammation marker detected real-world data one characteristic group percentage adult patient persistent asthma since childhood higher finding suggests significant proportion patient obese asthma positive type-2 inflammation marker early-onset type obesity-related asthma childhood early-onset

participant study adipocytokines non-type-2 cytokine serum identical individual nt2 group course type-2 inflammation marker higher patient group finding indicate patient obese asthma positive type-2 inflammation marker type-2 inflammation adipocytokine-related non-type-2 inflammation patient obese asthma negative type-2 inflammation marker mainly adipocytokine-related non-type-2 inflammation therefore overlapping inflammation patient obese asthma positive type-2 inflammation marker appears associated severe disease phenotype fact real-life data showed patient acute exacerbation table overlapping inflammation patient obese asthma positive type-2 inflammation marker seems cause distinctive response mepolizumab obese asthma although mepolizumab reported effective obese asthma percentage super-responders patient reported low mechanism increased type-2 inflammation adult obese asthma seem heterogeneous relationship asthma obesity reported bidirectional mean possibility obesity increase asthma severity asthma increase risk obesity patient severe asthma higher risk obesity frequent use systemic corticosteroid sedentary lifestyle resulting poor asthma control contrast evidence suggesting obesity-related factor might involved upregulation type-2 inflammation sputum eosinophil count il-5 expression ccr3 expression positively correlated body mass index bmi visceral fat area asthmatic participant additionally epidemiological study showed eosinophil count correlated bmi healthy participant thus may association obesity-related factor increased type-2 inflammation pulmonary function patient obese asthma positive type-2 inflammation marker lower patient obese asthma negative type-2 inflammation marker univariable analysis however variable considered confounders multivariable logistic regression analysis finding suggest patient may experience compromised lung function due increased frequency exacerbation and/or prolonged asthma duration persistent asthma since childhood presented table key strength study patient enrolled database diagnosed asthma trained allergy specialist physician training allergy specialist based gina guideline however limitation study limitation eosinophil rast score used divide enrolled patient nt2 group using high-dose ocs would influence level eosinophil blood ideally method also take account serum cytokine related type-2 inflammation sputum eosinophil fractional exhaled nitric oxide breath would better however since data available parameter database realistic divide group using eosinophil count rast score another potential limitation enrolled patient exclusively japanese individual however think impact minimal definition obesity japanese individual used study definition obesity used based criterion established japan society study obesity definition specifically developed japanese individual based observation threshold rise obesity-related disease population occurs bmi kg/m higher world health organization definition obesity hand bmi kg/m higher based global survey indicate threshold increase obesity-related disease bmi kg/m higher therefore considered obese group study corresponds obese population worldwide term physiological characteristic conclusion patient obese asthma positive type-2 inflammation marker distinct phenotype obese asthma characterised persistent asthma since childhood severe asthma patient phenotype type-2 inflammation obesity-related non-type-2 inflammation extent latter phenotype strong patient obese asthma negative type-2 inflammation overlapping inflammation may cause severe disease phenotype mechanism elevation type-2 inflammation obese asthma seems heterogeneous adult patient obese asthma positive type-2 inflammation marker noteworthy therefore study phenotype
