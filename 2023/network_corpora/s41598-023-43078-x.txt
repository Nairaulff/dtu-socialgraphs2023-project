introduction one frequent surgical condition treated surgeon ventral hernia leblanc booth firstly published intraabdominal positioning prosthetic mesh ipom non-adhesive coating regarded milestone ventral hernia surgery due advancement minimally invasive technique ipom technique laparoscopic closure defect ipom plus reported franklin already received extensive acceptance due little impact stability abdominal wall great reproducibility primary disadvantage however increased risk intestinal injury potential long-term problem intraperitoneal mesh placement despite remarkable development industry mesh technology significant risk persisted furthermore ipom plus advantage acute chronic pain quality life extended view totally extraperitoneal e-tep repair inguinal hernia first reported jorge daes adopted ventral hernia belyansky later non-composite mesh positioned retromuscular plane without fixation although reduces risk visceral injury bought intraperitoneal mesh posterior sheath

table quality life survey information carolina comfort scale full size table discussion recently several technique mesh positioning plane developed incisional hernia thus might challenging choose ventral hernia surgery two popular minimally invasive method ventral hernia nowadays ipom plus e-tep procedure compared open mesh repair ipom plus repair infection wound-healing problem however ipom plus linked higher risk bowel lesion adhesive small bowel obstruction asbo intestinal erosion greater morbidity following reoperation risk increase visceral injury e-tep technique benefit retromuscular mesh position minimally invasive nature operation combined reduce complication keeping foreign material abdominal cavity break posterior sheath retromuscular technique crossover tar however approach would separate peritoneum doe break structure abdominal wall extent could get around positioning preperitoneal mesh correctly prevent foreign body entering abdominal cavity prolonged duration surgery taken account may best choice maintains integrity functionality abdominal wall much possible also advantage risk complication quality life postoperative length stay cost-effective result obtained analyzed detail according data difference risk complication group ipom plus group little literature technology comparable technology searched literature e-tep available data e-tep

conventional macro-porous mesh ensured closure defect linea alba posterior rectus sheath reduce risk seroma formation recurrence eventration pseudorecurrence case routinely closed fascial defect might explain seroma hematoma case study therefore result study consistent existed study performance complication also worth mentioning table show mesh area group small ipom group due difficulty separating preperitoneal space long-term follow-up necessary determine whether increase recurrence rate big difference quality life laparoscopic ipom plus quality life evaluated based score including pain mesh sensation mobility limitation three component study comparing quality life ipom plus group group based comparative result found could improve quality life patient short term within six month preperitoneal approach provides possibility proper position mesh sandwiched posterior fascia peritoneum without fixation maybe lack fixation reason reduced postoperative pain mesh sensation mobility limitation contrary majority minimally invasive procedure ipom doe always result pain relief improvement quality life research revealed connection aggressive double crown fixation and/or transfascial suture postoperative pain following ipom repair early postoperative pain prevalent reported incidence range pain last week month make difficult patient recover resume normal activity quickly higher quality life score also consistent longer postoperative length stay higher medical expense ipom group approach offer higher level cost-effectiveness postoperative length stay medical expense group significantly lower ipom plus group cost medical care drastically lowered use expensive composite mesh fixation tacker group mitigates complication reduces postoperative length stay despite above-mentioned advantage cost paid prolonged operative time ergonomic problem surgical team group report mean operative time 213.4 min significantly longer ipom plus group surgical procedure considerably complex summarized following practical experience learning curve approach may steep requiring advanced laparoscopic skill surgeon make preoperative surgical planning trocar layout convenient operation according size site defect previous surgical scar may benefit reasonable trocar placement term technical ergonomic benefit decreased physical stress strain improved visualization access target tissue main issue preventing abdominal wall bulging recurrence requires firm closure anterior defect although limited experience consider approach also applied simple case many type small medium-sized ventral incisional hernia however given limitation workspace rigid stiff instrument hypothesized technique adequate manage large complex defect study limitation include limited sample size non-multicenter study enough data follow-up phase draw judgment long-term complication study retrospective design demonstrate method potential advantage solid proof randomized control trial required conclusion approach involves preperitoneal ventral hernia repair viable minimally invasive method finding indicate ipom plus technique yield comparable outcome term complication basis protecting abdominal wall structure approach better quality life short term within six month higher cost-effective shorter postoperative length stay ipom plus approach take longer operative time besides important consider long-term advantage preperitoneal mesh location technique intraabdominal prosthesis ipom plus technique
