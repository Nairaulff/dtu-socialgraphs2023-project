introduction male house mouse musculus deposit urinary scent mark contain compound often called pheromone attract female reviewed induce change female reproductive physiology behaviour reviewed example exposure male urine accelerates female sexual maturation vandenbergh effect especially urine dominant male exposure male urine also promotes oestrous cycling whitten effect sexual receptivity maternal behaviour male increase excretion pheromone urine obtain territory become socially dominant pheromone production correlate male reproductive success seminatural context effect female chemical signal male nearly well understood female pheromone identified though see yet male mouse attracted urine female exposure female urine elicits male scent-marking emission ultrasonic vocalization especially male previously exposed female stimulus sexually primed exposure female urine activates rapid rise male luteinizing hormone testosterone hypothalamic-pituitary–gonadal hpg stimulates male copulatory behaviour spermatogenesis exposing juvenile male adult female mouse accelerates male growth body mass gonadal development testis mass however unclear whether effect due female pheromone cue ultrasonic vocalization usvs potentially priming effect opposite sex maruniak colleague investigated whether exposure female urine sufficient induce male puberty accelerate growth exposed juvenile male strain cf-1 adult female day age confirmed exposure promoted male growth sexual development whereas exposure female urine alone detectable effect author cautioned drawing strong conclusion negative result however pointed many possible method pattern urine exposure might occur natural population tested experiment thus study wild mouse needed resolve question accelerating puberty growth enhance male competitive ability least optimum though see however accelerated growth may also negative tradeoff example faster juvenile growth correlated reduced adult lifespan laboratory mouse male

previous study juvenile male mouse reared presence adult female exposed female stimulus barrier effect female exposure male growth previous study mixed transitory whereas experiment conducted longer period time difference male body mass stabilized end experiment day emphasize result originally expected instead expected exposing male female urine would reduce male growth increase male scent marking scent marking reported reduce male growth contrast result show male like female show pheromone-induced growth acceleration previously predicted also show increased male growth caused exposure female urine occurred despite increase male scent marking unlike previous study however found evidence exposure opposite-sex urinary urine enhanced male sexual organ testis epididymis preputial gland though might missed difference may developed earlier puberty might temporary thus future study needed examine early effect female urine development male testis organ epididymis seminal vesicle preputial gland several difference previous study maruniak colleague used different male mouse wild-derived house mouse versus cd-1 strain different feeding protocol controlled food intake versus libitum diet different method presenting urine stimulus filter paper inside male cage versus sprayed top moreover presented urine novel individual female whereas urine previous study presented pool female day may led olfactory habituation desensitization another reason author cautioned drawing conclusion negative result recently published study laboratory mouse found evidence exposure adult urine affected growth either sex contrast previous study reported exposure urine adult virgin female reduced female growth interestingly recent study found exposing female mouse urine adult female male increased longevity median lifespan though exposing male adult urine either sex effect taken together study indicate exposure urine conspecific surprising effect growth sexual maturation even longevity however unclear explain discrepancy among study clear exposure female urine accelerated male growth study though effect due access food present previous study mouse kept cage moreover present study difference food intake explain result male kept controlled diet usually ate entire ration day future study consider difference male growth puberty might explained difference food intake subject provided unrestricted diet accelerated male puberty growth induced exposure adult female urine likely regulated endocrine mechanism increase pulsatile secretion growth hormone pituitary insulin-like growth factor igf-1 liver influence puberty growth pheromone female urine may stimulate male pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone gnrh transduction initiate puberty onset gnrh neuron originate olfactory pit development migrate brain hypothalamus control hypothalamic-pituitary–gonadal hormonal axis gnrh control release luteinizing hormone anterior pituitary activates gonadal function including testosterone release male mouse show dramatic rise release three week age corresponds divergence growth treatment control male observed difference body mass treatment male control observed study significant time puberty week age approximately androgen level peaked juvenile male mouse reared presence adult female exposing adult male mouse adult female female urine elevates male level trigger testosterone surge maruniak found male mouse began secrete response female urine around day age repeated exposure female urine resulted habituation thus study needed investigate effect unfamiliar female urine male gnrh level also pulsatile release measured recently developed method contrast exposure female urine found exposure adult male urine influence growth juvenile male indicates growth acceleration response female urine sex-specific previous study found exposing male mouse male urine increased scent marking reportedly reduced growth rate body size earlier study found exposing juvenile male adult male temporarily inhibited growth sexual development however result likely due aggressive attack rather exposure adult male urine future study thus needed determine many compound differ urine male female mouse volatile non-volatile explain different effect male growth also tested whether exposure female urine subsequent change growth sexual maturation impair male immune resistance bacterial infection salmonella enterica however found evidence reduced pathogen clearance body mass survival experimental male compared control male result show long-term exposure female urine doe necessarily impair enhance reviewed male immune resistance infection future study needed test whether rapid juvenile growth enhances male competitive ability mating reproductive success whether accelerated growth incurs trade-off increased risk attack dominant territorial male summary finding show exposing juvenile male house mouse urine sexually mature female trigger increased growth rate body mass compared control first study knowledge show exposure female urine accelerates male growth underlying mechanism unclear endocrine-mediated puberty acceleration possible finding could prove useful future study aiming manipulate male growth sexual development using natural method finally male may accelerate growth sexual development exposed female stimulus improve ability compete rival attract female may fitness benefit accelerated growth also potential trade-off found adverse effect immune resistance tolerance pathogen challenge future study needed determine whether female urine exposure affect male growth sexual development natural naturalistic social context study also needed identify priming pheromone female well male urine chemically identified synthesized priming pheromone could potentially applied agriculture enhance growth livestock specie including domestic swine sheep goat cattle though natural method urine sufficient bio-stimulation originally described ungulate first became popular method reduce age puberty domestic swine boar effect
