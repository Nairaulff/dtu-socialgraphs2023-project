introduction gastric adenocarcinoma gca one common neoplasm world significant impact patient health system third leading cause death due cancer worldwide eastern central asian region associated highest estimated mortality rate according national cancer registry data age standardized incidence rate per 100,000 male 4.4 female 1.7 national cancer registry represents total number case male female might reflect true incidence disease due potential under-reporting case national government statistic process private medical care patient opting alternative traditional form treatment treatment modality gca depends stage disease clinical presentation prognosis gca remains dismal 5-year survival around 5–20 despite advancement endoscopic surgical oncological modality therefore remains poorly resolved oncological problem main reason behind advanced stage tumour presentation hence long delay probably unfavorable factor patient prognosis overall literature study looked aspect delay diagnosis gca japan screening programme gca resulted 5-year survival rate given low incidence disease sri lanka setting implementation comprehensive screening programme feasible therefore diagnosis gca inevitably follows symptom reported patient according available published data sri lankan population majority presented advanced stage time diagnosis therefore identification intervening factor minimizing delay diagnosis treatment gca benefit term improved surgical treatment quality life survival setting around patient gca qualify curative treatment consists surgical resection without adjuvant chemotherapy 5-year overall survival curative treatment remains poor overall her2 positivity sri lanka gca found relatively lower according previous prospective study therefore exploring factor result advance presentation leading poor outcome timely need improving survival gca setting present published data regarding delayed presentation gca possible association symptom-to-treatment

independently-related adverse factor result fatal outcome gca majority patient presented advanced stage sinister symptom precluding curative resection hence referred palliative chemotherapy therefore gca patient presenting advanced symptom chance developing incurable disease requiring palliative chemotherapy compared received curative surgical resection prognosis gca highly dependent disease stage diagnosis surgery mainstay treatment could cure patient early-stage disease date survival rate gca well difference survival rate observed eastern western gca mainly attributed tnm stage therefore efficient diagnostic pathway key timely diagnosis diagnostic pathway patient gca patient delay longest followed delay initiating definitive treatment either surgery chemotherapy contrast delay performing endoscopy pathology delay shorter finding present study indicate patient may fully aware alarm symptom since duration patient delay long raising awareness gca alarm symptom susceptible population may efficient way improve prompt presentation health service shorten time development symptom diagnosis hand exploring reason postponing healthcare consultation would enable designing targeted approach problem thus intervention integrated well-developed public health infrastructure sri lanka household allocated geographical public health unit called medical officer health moh area moh staff deliver public health service clinic-based setting well visiting house domiciliary-services hence set health education advice developed targeting alarm symptom message could delivered community staff member arrange public health service according life-cycle approach although screening endoscopy program upper gastrointestinal cancer unavailable sri lanka upper endoscopy facility much improved past decade despite ample access upper endoscopy delay diagnosis still seem common virtually affect stage gca diagnosis well outcome patient fact country like sri lanka screening programme feasible due lower incidence disease diagnosis gca inevitably relies symptom reported patient furthermore better collaboration curative preventive sector way forward improve outcome gca therefore increased awareness gca symptom susceptible population well correct interpretation symptom prompt referral endoscopic investigation could reduce diagnostic delay theoretically improve survival method intervention regard could formulation guideline aiming facilitate general practitioner promptly refer patient specialized care present study higher median delay seeking medical advice patient advanced tumour stage stage iii/iv belonged group patient significant pathology delay confirming diagnosis delay initiating treatment pathology result critical diagnosis surgical decision making regarding gca palliative group gca tissue diagnosis pathology report key factor initiation chemotherapy present study showed specimen transfer delay lab delay receipt pathology report ward mainly contributed overall pathology delay therefore important minimize preventable delay time limit producing histopathology report also important establish online portal hospital information system laboratory information system easy access histology report future hospital system furthermore one method intervention isto make sure specimen immediately transferred laboratory end resection theater end endoscopy list according cox regression analysis age patient treatment modality significantly associated survival cohort patient palliative treatment biopsy higher hazard ratio compared underwent surgical intervention plausible advanced disease profile significant association histopathology treatment delay hazard function could due unrecognized contributing factor need investigated larger sample improving delay survival timely detection gca among patient without alarm symptom challenging given high incidence common upper symptom functional disorder low risk cancer hand simply lowering threshold endoscopy solution reducing time referral already growing demand diagnostic endoscopy service secondary care lowering threshold endoscopy might result increased risk non-indicated endoscopy normal result therefore early referral patient alarm symptom i.e anorexia anaemia without delay important aspect early diagnosis sri lanka despite improvement endoscopic facility delay diagnosis still seem common patient delay delay initiating definitive treatment important contributor waiting time gca setting might affect stage gca diagnosis well outcome therefore increased awareness symptom well correct interpretation symptom prompt referral investigation could reduce diagnostic delay theoretically improve survival study several limitation factor resulted delayed presentation patient healthcare service well factor resulted delay starting palliative chemotherapy patient wish alternative treatment strategy belief fear initiating chemotherapy etc investigated getting insight reason postponing medical consultation would required targeted approach secondly patient delay primary resection exact reason possible causative factor postponement due lack adequate intensive care bed evaluated survival follow-up time also uniform range 0–240 week however exposure except duration chemotherapy change follow period author confident major degree survival bias excluded duration chemotherapy usually decided based case-by-case basis study explored patient visiting government setting explore visiting private sector conclusion recommendation patient delay delay initiation definitive treatment important delay gca setting sri lanka comprehensive endoscopy screening programme gca available public health education predominantly community focus susceptible population need initiated strengthened public health intervention aiming shorten patient delay time proper referral specialist care would play important role formulation guideline aiming facilitate general practitioner promptly refer patient specialized care one important measure overcome patient delay may interest see whether finding applicable similar low incidence setting gca limited screening
