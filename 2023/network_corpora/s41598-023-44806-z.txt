highest number people diabetes estimated number people diabetes increased highest growth middle-income country economic development urbanization changed food habit could reason increased number addition genetics also play major role increasing prevalence disease several study indicate south asian particular asian indian susceptible insulin resistance compared ethnic group even migrant indian living different part world found higher diabetes rate genome-wide association study gwas done far different population identified several single nucleotide polymorphism snp associated t2d odds ratio
