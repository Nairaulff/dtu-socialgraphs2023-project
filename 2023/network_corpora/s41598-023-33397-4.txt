introduction recent year infertile woman seek vitro fertilization ivf embryo transfer achieve live birth success ivf affected many factor including patient age ovary status ovulation protocol embryo quality embryo quality particularly important ivf success therefore critical recent technological development method embryo evaluation including time-lapse imaging embryo metabolomics preimplantation genetic testing aneuploidy however classical morphological evaluation still gold standard predicting embryo high implantation potential achieving high live birth probability improvement blastocyst culture technology growing number centre choose blastocyst culture single blastocyst transfer embryo high developmental potential selected blastocyst culture blastocyst formation rate reflects developmental potential embryo however cleavage-stage embryo form blastocyst thus centre still use cleavage-stage transfer blastocyst culture surplus sibling embryo obtained transfer assisted reproductive technology procedure several study suggest number surplus embryo positively correlate live birth rate moreover transfer day cleavage embryo blastocyst formation rate sibling embryo pregnant patient significantly higher embryo non-pregnant patient finding suggest one embryo high developmental potential embryo oocyte retrieval cycle also high developmental potential thus ability sibling embryo form blastocyst may prognostic factor clinical outcome following cleavage embryo transfer indeed many study suggested implantation clinical pregnancy rate group sibling embryo formed blastocyst reported significantly higher sibling embryo form blastocyst consequently associating ability form blastocyst higher live birth rate although time blastocyst formation varies blastocyst formed day day day fertilisation study found survival ability embryo faster development speed high whereas slow development associated lower pregnancy rate suggested embryonic development speed may predictive likelihood successful implantation transferred blastocyst hypothesised blastulation day sibling embryo could potentially serve probability marker live birth fresh embryo transfer however best knowledge relationship blastulation day sibling embryo clinical outcome cleavage embryo transfer examined therefore aimed determine whether blastocyst development speed sibling embryo positively corelated live birth rate transfer fresh cleavage embryo result study retrospectively analysed data woman mean age 33.2 3.2 year implantation clinical pregnancy live birth rate 34.9 53.7 42.2

without blastocyst formation hence author suggested blastocyst formation remaining embryo predicts outcome embryo transfer also provides valuable reference information preserved embryo transfer future study found number blastocyst formed remaining embryo significantly positively correlated implantation live birth rate showed blastocyst formation indeed good predictor clinical outcome day blastocyst formation vary asked whether blastocyst development speed sibling embryo could predict clinical outcome fresh embryo transfer previous study report clinical outcome blastocyst transfer better blastocyst transfer irrespective use fresh frozen cycle therefore hypothesised speed blastocyst formation sibling embryo correlate live birth probability cleavage embryo transfer found significant difference live birth rate group well miscarriage rate cleavage embryo transfer result may related lower rate good quality embryo transferred group addition age patient group slightly older although significant difference among group however multiple regression analysis showed age number oocyte quality embryo transferred longer risk factor live birth rate adjusted confounding factor development speed sibling embryo still positively correlated live birth rate fresh cleavage embryo transfer live birth rate group similar significantly higher group finding consistent result blastocyst transfer cycle revealed patient received blastocyst transfer better clinical outcome blastocyst difference two group persisted even blastocyst similar quality study suggest higher rate aneuploidy genetic abnormality retarded blastocyst result clinical outcome difference group exploring relationship morphological morphodynamic parameter euploid status 1,730 blastocyst minasi found euploid embryo form expanded blastocyst rapidly improved trophectoderm inner cell mass higher proportion normal chromosome blastocyst group patient grouped age moreover blastocyst transfer hypothesised increase chance selecting euploid blastocyst woman undergo preimplantation genetic testing therefore result suggested speed blastocyst formation sibling embryo could predict pregnancy outcome transfer result also showed blastocyst development speed faster live birth rate cleavage transfer similar two group irrespective quality blastocyst sibling embryo d5-1vs d5-2 0.05 however sibling embryo developed slowly patient high proportion good blastocyst d6-1 significantly higher live birth rate transfer low proportion good blastocyst d6-2 42.4 32.3 0.05 may euploid embryo likely develop faster aneuploid embryo regardless quality reported even transferred euploid embryo clinical outcome woman received blastocyst worse woman received blastocyst difference euploidy rate explain speed blastocyst development affect clinical outcome embryo doe suggest factor likely involved embryo metabolism epigenetics blastocyst formation sibling embryo likely represents developmental capacity transferred embryo embryo develop faster likely form euploid blastocyst suggesting embryo transferred could develop euploid embryo vivo proceed live birth overall study suggests blastocyst formed sibling embryo higher live birth rate transfer regardless blastocyst quality however slower developing sibling embryo blastocyst quality predicted pregnancy outcome transfer study highlight importance development speed sibling embryo clinical outcome fresh cleavage embryo transfer parameter may help retrospectively evaluate clinical outcome current transplantation cycle predict cumulative pregnancy rate future result study also help clinician make accurate medical decision subsequent cycle addition formation blastocyst sibling embryo help better understand cause failed transfer cycle example sibling embryo display high blastocyst development speed high quality unsuccessful cleavage embryo transfer factor embryo quality endometrial characteristic luteal function support endocrine immune status embryologist skill must considered analysing cause implantation failure study limitation first transferred fresh embryo selected using morphological criterion subjective procedure conducted embryologist therefore embryo highest developmental potential may consistently identified embryo would selected transfer cultured blastocyst-stage cleavage embryo transfer unsuccessful even though sibling embryo displayed high blastocyst development speed high quality still rule effect embryo quality outcome second retrospective study could affected bias confounding factor diminish impact factor analysis included patient without uterine endometrial disease received number transferred embryo addition minimised impact confounding factor performing multiple regression analysis validated conclusion conclusion study suggests blastocyst development speed sibling embryo positively correlated live birth fresh embryo transfer blastocyst quality could also predict live birth sibling embryo formed blastocyst finding provide new alternative method predicting outcome embryo transfer exception morphological evaluation embryo cleavage stage analysis sibling embryo property help establish possible cause embryo transfer failure select optimal treatment thereby increasing chance successful pregnancy woman undergoing treatment cycle method study design participant record woman underwent cleavage embryo
