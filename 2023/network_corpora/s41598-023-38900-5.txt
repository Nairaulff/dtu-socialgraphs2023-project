introduction since novel coronavirus disease covid-19 recurrent global pandemic january 664,873,023 people infected 6,724,248 people corresponding patient disease died globally additionally undiagnosed covid-19 victim reported become major global public health concern approximately 20.2 hospitalized covid-19 patient required invasive mechanical ventilation imv 26.5 died furthermore meta-analysis mortality rate patient reported high despite advancement development vaccine novel therapeutic agent treatment option dramatically improve condition severe ill patient limited therefore identification prognostic factor covid-19 patient requiring imv would help clinician considering treatment intensity additional therapeutic option may provide new insight pathogenesis covid-19 several

disappeared multivariate analysis addition obesity associated implementation vv-ecmo covid-19 obesity reported risk factor increased severity explained several mechanism including causal relationship obesity multiple comorbidities hypertension diabetes thrombosis decreased functional residual capacity increased respiratory workload addition fact fat enhances at2 expression covid-19 also enhances at2 expression down-regulation ace2 may synergistically promote pathologic injury lung exerting proinflammatory response increasing vascular permeability limited study investigating association obesity prognosis including mortality severe covid-19 unclear whether association large observational study covid-19 patient admitted icu reported obesity affect icu mortality similar finding present study previous multicenter study covid-19 patient admitted icu reported different result obesity significantly associated increased mortality however cutoff value obesity shown associated death bmi

lowest death bmi kg/m multivariate analysis however study included 4.5 highly probable covid-19 although study conducted severe covid-19 patient admitted icu also included non-imv patient since indication icu admission largely affected supply demand balance medical care especially pandemic situation would inappropriate define patient severity icu admission present study analyzed critically ill patient selecting patient required imv therefore result present study would extend evidence predicting outcome severely ill covid-19 patient along previous report study association obesity low in-hospital mortality disappeared covariates considered first patient high bmi asian population represented study compared previously reported case shown supplementary fig similar previous report low obesity rate japanese population many obese patient bmi kg/m evaluated study may influenced present result fact standard error generated using gam becomes larger increasing bmi also indicates patient large bmi furthermore factor could also attributed lack association obesity adoption rate vv-ecmo previous study suggested severe obesity bmi kg/m relative contraindication could impacted implementation vv-ecmo obese patient however cohort prevalence severe obesity remarkably low suggesting limited influence second mechanism thought younger age obese group large number elderly patient nonobese group gupta reported age important factor affecting mortality patient covid-19 requiring icu admission consistent lower death due younger age obesity group furthermore obese group show difference prevalence coexisting disorder may influenced result asian population distribution visceral adipose tissue vat greater subcutaneous fat bmi likely develop lifestyle-related disease compared western population additionally cohort predominantly comprised male participant likely increased vat female however gender difference influence result multivariate analysis although result differ present study considered obese group still young hence affected vat lifestyle-related disease additionally obese patient may started intensive care earlier based prediction illness may become severe could influenced result therefore population included study covid-19 patient requiring imv obesity doe appear strong effect mortality clinician treating patient may aware bmi strong predictor mortality strength limitation study several notable strength first best knowledge first study investigated association obesity mortality using real-world data large cohort confirmed covid-19 patient requiring imv asian population current study finding contribute research population second study used unified format obtain information course hospitalization research teaching hospital across japan thus certain level generalizability expected however several limitation study first due real-world study retrospective design concern regarding inaccuracy follow-up evaluation compared prospective design moreover treatment standardized thus issue residual confounding would major limitation therefore future study prospective design warranted second bmi data included self-reported value method measuring height weight standardized hospital may introduce measurement bias furthermore study based relatively early data covid-19 epidemic considering emergence different virus variant wide availability vaccine result study must cautiously interpreted future epidemic moreover continuous collection data regard also warranted conclusion japanese multicenter study patient severe covid-19 requiring imv showed obesity associated in-hospital mortality obesity may regarded failure factor intensive care critically ill covid-19 patient
