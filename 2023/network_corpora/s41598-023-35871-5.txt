introduction least since famous article powerful placebo beecher scientifically acknowledged placebo pill intervention beneficial effect consequently placebo may represent control condition randomized controlled study pharmacological research also considered respect therapeutic goal today significant impact placebo shown wide variety condition symptom unfortunately deception placebo believed crucial element placebo effect resulting severe ethical problem e.g. undermining consent trust patient healthcare provider trying administer placebo recently idea give placebo without deception would considered ridiculous intriguing new evidence demonstrates open-label placebo olps may help patient various clinical disorder even individual nonclinical symptom thus effect olps shown several different condition including example irritable bowel syndrome depression pain anxiety emotional distress furthermore reported olps may reduce symptom allergic rhinitis however olp study represent two-arm study usually olp treatment-as-usual tau condition problematic possible different handling group although formal patient-experimenter interaction may identical group experimenter might unconsciously focused participant olp group thereby providing support given olp trial obviously blinded participant know hypothesis study report self-report data response bias might consequence subliminal interaction blinded experimenter additional control condition conventional placebo would help address problem could also help answer question efficacy olp treatment thus reported effect size olp intervention usually based comparison tau condition known whether effect size olp similar lower higher conventional double-blind placebo assumption may justified since mechanism olp might different conventional placebo also important ass potential impact olps possible practical implication present study intended address gap aimed test efficacy olp approach relative double-blind placebo tau thus conducted randomized-controlled trial effect olps symptom seasonal allergic rhinitis allergic rhinitis affect population developed world associated high economic burden defined condition

olps based csms questionnaire recommended test change allergic symptom well widely used allows better comparability study furthermore olp group improved health-related quality life rqlq however nasal symptom measured find significant effect asking ass time last week might explained difficulty assessing allergic burden past remarkably found olp effect superior conventionally concealed placebo showed effect compared tau thus surprising see classic placebo effect considering waxing waning characteristic allergic symptom placebo effect allergic rhinitis well-known recent metanalysis revealed seasonal allergic rhinitis placebo response resulted improvement whereas active treatment antihistamine corticosteroid showed 1.56 2.71-fold greater improvement placebo one could speculate absence conventional placebo effect may accounted dosage form possibly kind placebo e.g. pill might induced placebo effect another reason may point group difference respect positive expectation although group received identical instruction expectation may still different olp group received bottle label placebo whereas bottle dbp group placebo probiotic label dbp condition participant took drop relatively long time may thought received treatment rather placebo view may also supported non-sweet taste drop therefore placebo instruction might effect participant future study ask participant end study think actually received present study one first 4-arm study comparing effect open-label concealed placebo locher compared olps conventionally concealed placebo treatment control pain tolerance result showed olps placebo deception differ subjective heat pain intensity unpleasantness rating lembo compared effect olps tau conventionally concealed placebo patient irritable bowel syndrome found olp superior tau improving symptom similar effect placebo deception result supplement result demonstrating olp even better dbp result suggest way olps work may different compared mechanism dbp example expectancy often used explain conventional placebo effect recent research suggests mechanism may account olp effect e.g. although exact mechanism olp effect remain cleared one could speculate mechanism seem important olps mechanism may distinguish olp dbp treatment however based present data feel unable address mechanism olps detail could replicate olp effect symptom seasonal allergic rhinitis recent study find effect olps patient several difference might account lack effect first study kube provided olp remotely thus personal interaction reduced using online way communicate perform measurement second point may even important kube conducted study covid-19 pandemic may influential way may covid-19 pandemic affected result present study included patient end pandemic allowing compare general allergic symptom baseline data also efficacy olp effect pandemic result demonstrate allergic symptom general reduced covid-19 pandemic line recent study reason improvement symptom may reduced confrontation allergic pollen lock-down situation due obligation wearing mask public addition psychological factor may explain finding since nose related symptom allergy similar covid-19 symptom individual may neglected symptom want think chance infected virus general allergic symptom affected also found olp effect weaker covid-19 pandemic although consider comparison based relatively participant one could speculate individual covid-19 pandemic might prone olp effect example psychological reason might explain difference see furthermore smaller olp effect may explained statistical effect reduced baseline allergic symptom covid-19 pandemic may given opportunity show improvement unfortunately sufficient data ass impact covid-19 pandemic concealed placebo observed significant effect olps allergic symptom using csms olps showed weak effect diary data one explanation might diary data ask score situation general way contrast csms ask specific symptom previous study found effect also diary data asking specifically allergic symptom interestingly recent study olp effect allergy symptom observed pronounced effect participant asked rate frequency rather severity symptom current study similarly found highest effect size doe ask symptom severity directly csms doe remarkably found weakest result diary data asked general feeling respect allergic may interpreted rating severity symptom difference may point importance way ass self-report data olp study limitation study mentioned data current study relies self-report questionnaire given olp treatment administered double blinded way response bias might problem although tried address issue adding conventional placebo condition study needed ass impact olps particular study using physiological data source could help test impact olps allergic symptom example leibowitz examined physiological allergic reaction histamine skin prick test found effect olp participant strong belief placebo furthermore future study needed replicate finding using example increased sample size present study aimed test efficacy olp patient seasonal allergic rhinitis result demonstrated olps improved self-reported allergic symptom 4-week trial whereas conventional placebo failed show effect result point different mechanism placebo treatment conclude result encourage research effect olps
