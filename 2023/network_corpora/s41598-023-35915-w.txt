introduction recent outbreak foodborne illness attributed biofilms biofilm formation integral part microbial life cycle nature foodborne pathogen form biofilms survival strategy various unfavorable environment also become frequent source recurrent contamination outbreak foodborne illness approximately percent foodborne illness outbreak caused biofilms according food safety research biofilm form bacterial adaptation colonizes attache surface covered extracellular polymeric material becomes major problem food health marine industry eighty percent outbreak due pathogenic bacteria contributed biofilm-forming bacteria formation biofilms pathogenic bacteria especially processing equipment big challenge food industry food industry—such brewing industry dairy product processing fresh product meat—the presence biofilm within production line source contamination foodstuff pas production line formation biofilms also generates negative impact non-food industry oil drilling industry paper production health products/medicines biofilms bring difficulty production process reduce heat transfer block tube filter cause surface damage equipment strategy far applied industry control formation biofilms using chemical acid oxidizing compound chlorine surfactant however use chemical induces limitation pose risk cross-contamination cause poisoning main challenge preventing formation biofilms known high resistance antimicrobial antibiotic disinfectant sanitizers making difficult remove besides biofilms cause bacteria higher resistance high temperature ray x-ray drought new approach needed control biofilms one potential alternative solution explored use bacteriophage bacterial virus capable lysing biofilm-forming bacteria bacillus spp one bacteria often generates problem related
