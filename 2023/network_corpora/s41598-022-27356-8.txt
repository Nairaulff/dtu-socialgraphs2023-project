identification ipa among sfts patient necessary study incidence ipa sfts patient 32.8 similar study bae incidence 31.9 respectively result indicated sfts patient would prone aspergillus infection factor might contribute increased risk susceptibility ipa including median age year uncontrolled underlying disease leukocytopenia neutropenia severe complication impaired immune function excessive inflammatory response aim study confirm predictor ipa early course disease analyzing demographic feature clinical manifestation laboratory parameter sfts patient patient diabetes prone aspergillus infection high level blood glucose conducive growth aspergillus inhibits leukocyte chemotaxis reduces phagocytosis phagocyte decrease complement production diabetes may considered risk factor

risk factor ipa however multivariable logistic regression analysis support independent predictor ipa leukopenia mainly neutropenia well-known risk factor ipa invasive aspergillus infection neutrophil major immune cell non-specific immunity exert anti-infection effect chemotaxis opsonization phagocytosis therefore persistent neutropenia high risk deep aspergillus infection platelet play anti-fungal effect adhering cell wall hypha block aspergillus germination hyphal elongation activated platelet removed blood thrombocytopenia may result invasive aspergillus infection sfts patient characterized leukopenia thrombocytopenia may high risk factor ipa present study count wbc neutrophil reduced obviously ipa group non-ipa group significant difference two group therefore result suggest reduced wbc neutrophil risk factor ipa among sfts patient reason might leukopenia neutropenia transient like patient hematologic tumor although thrombocytopenia could seen group thrombocytopenia pronounced ipa

regression analysis especially cutoff value platelet sensitivity specificity predicting ipa 81.8 73.3 sfts patient elderly median age year immune function decrease increase age associated severity mortality disease addition sftsv infection also damage immune function sfts patient changing distribution lymphocytic sub-populations reason put patient high risk aspergillus infection study age independent predictor ipa damage immune function due sftsv infection could considered independent predictor generally cell mediated immunity play powerful role protection invasive fungal infection cd4 cell antigen presenting cell cd8 cell cytotoxic cell constitute important immune defense barrier fungal infection study cd4 cd8 cell decreased obviously ipa group average level respectively decreased lymphocyte resulted number active cell insufficient participate cellular immune response caused lower cellular immune function among sfts patient increased risk ipa result multivariable logistic

eortc/msg criterion diagnosis ipa study categorized probable diagnosis lack histopathologic evidence false positive might present among patient diagnosed ipa previous study clinical algorithm diagnosing ipa discriminating aspergillus colonization invasive disease icu patient aspergillus positive culture established algorithm demonstrated specificity sensitivity similar previous study better diagnosis method necessary discriminate colonization fsts patient positive aspergillus culture increase rigor research second corticosteroid clinically applied treat sfts patient ability

among patient sfts conclusion patient sfts need alert possibility secondary ipa study confirmed uncontrolled diabetes platelet cd4 cell 319/μl cd8 cell 395/μl could considered independent predictor development ipa identification predictor may prompt physician initiate early diagnostic examination aspergillus infection initiate initial treatment contribute improve outcome sfts patient
