introduction hallmark pathology parkinson disease loss dopamine-producing neuron substantia nigra leading dopamine deficit striatum cure current treatment aimed providing symptom relief gold standard among treatment levodopa l-dopa prescribed vast majority patient within first year diagnosis direct dopamine precursor taken orally absorbed small intestine travel brain via circulatory system converted dopamine inside neuron l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase aadc l-dopa usually taken several time per day goal keeping circulating concentration within critical window therapeutic efficacy
