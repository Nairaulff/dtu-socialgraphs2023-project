introduction dystrophic humic lake according commonly accepted definition thienemann acid lake poor nutrient organism brown-colored water organic matter originating mainly peat bog forest surrounding lake humic substance dissolved water acidify form complex phosphorus ammonia metal ion therefore water contains small concentration dissolved mineral substance large content humic substance give brown color water increase solar energy adsorption increase warming epilimnion thus increasing thermal stratification result sharp thermal stratification even lake meter deep dimictic meromictic large deficiency oxygen thermocline although humic lake usually considered unproductive may contain several group producer dystrophic lake large number bacteria use carbon humic substance thus microbiological loop seems play important role classic trophic pyramid harmonious clear water lake important component primary producer humic lake photoautotrophic picoplankton mixotrophic phytoplankton photoautotrophic picoplankton could favored intensive nutrient recycling within microbial loop mixotrophs osmotrophs could take advantage hypolimnetic pool ammonium high bacterial production low light condition particularly large flagellate gonyostomum semen form dense bloom humic lake boreal temperate latitude may explain literature report based study freshwater lake showing
