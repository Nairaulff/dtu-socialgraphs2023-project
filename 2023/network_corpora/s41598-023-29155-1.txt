introduction constipation recognized infrequent difficult defecation diagnosed according rome criterion constipation common complaint pediatric clinic visit making worldwide public health issue incidence constipation united state child approximately reported variously different region based different diagnostic criterion functional constipation common type organic cause commonly recognized functional constipation usually diagnosed based history physical examination case functional constipation likely investigation necessary rule organic cause may expensive process laboratory radiographic testing even rectal biopsy performed definite diagnosis organic constipation lead poisoning differential diagnosis pediatric constipation diagnosed blood lead level laboratory testing lead poisoning often caused occupational environmental exposure child impacted lead especially neurodevelopmental complication child absorb lead adult due hand-mouth behavior environmental exposure common child higher lead absorption rate augmented iron calcium deficiency neurological complication permanent irreversible making lead poisoning early detection important child screening organic cause rarely cost effective recommend screening enough information regarding screening outbreak region higher rate lead poisoning aimed evaluate bll pediatric adolescent clinic visit due constipation tehran iran sharp rise lead poisoning also sought find significant factor patient history presentation population normal elevated bll method cross sectional study prospective data collection data

significant difference patient elevated bll although preventive measure exerted control lead exposure worldwide like ban use lead paint lead poisoning remained challenge globally source lead may include old metal pipe herbal medicine old building paint imported toy candy addition outbreak lead poisoning happened due contaminated water iran recent year massive outbreak lead poisoning occurred due adulterated opium fact especially aligns fact respiratory tract greatest source absorbing lead report lead poisoning due inhaled opium thus opium addiction family may prone child exposed lead secondary inhaling accidental ingestion opium happened another source lead poisoning air pollution study pediatric lead poisoning tehran number lead-poisoned child relatively higher industrial zone district highest record air pollution tehran metropolis iran struggling problem severe air pollution especially particulate matter pollution recent year industrialization lack proper air pollution control plan worsened situation leading great undesirable impact public health pollution related house dust also recognized another source lead poisoning lead poisoning presented variety sign symptom including gastrointestinal manifestation including abdominal pain constipation anemia fatigue peripheral neuropathy alteration nervous system function renal dysfunction severe case papillary edema coma convulsion yet many case lead exposure remains asymptomatic fact highlight blood test measuring bll definitive test evaluate lead exposure center disease control prevention suggests concerning outcome lead exposure child permanent neurologic impairment subsequent effect concentration learning ability turn influence proper academic development individual achievement believed child prone neurologic complication comparison adult due incomplete blood–brain barrier formation past cdc reporting case bll parent year reduce level recently even lowered level 3.75 recent recommendation however reported lead exerts deleterious effect neurologic cognitive performance individual level fact justify utility bll measurement child prevent lower lead exposure proper intervention case bll chelation therapy cdc suggests constipation one common gastrointestinal manifestation lead poisoning believed relate direct inhibitory effect lead neural plexus intestine also smooth muscle contraction metabolic change also involved like accommodation aminolaevulinic acid porphyrin precursor due porphyrinopathy induced lead turn lower intestinal motility also lead alteration excitation cell membrane change activity cell membrane canal effective occurrence constipation current study history upper endoscopy workup chronic refractory abdominal discomfort showed significant difference patient elevated bll comparison patient normal level endoscopic work threefold higher group patient elevated bll recommended endoscopic evaluation considered constipation followed alarming sign including weight loss abdominal pain tenderness lack appetite gastrointestinal bleeding since lead poisoning compatible manifest variety gastrointestinal symptom addition constipation assumed higher rate endoscopy attributed fact another project presence lead poisoning adult patient unjustified abdominal pain lead poisoning outbreak endoscopic evaluation also higher thus may beneficial consider lead poisoning presence gastrointestinal sign symptom especially outbreak district high rate lead contamination also significant difference educational status mother factor also significant factor former project lead evaluation pediatric patient abdominal pain assumed probable mother academic degree got employed housewife mother involved cleaning living place fact especially aligned finding project age significant finding age period child show hand-mouth behavior susceptible hazardous consequence lead exposure ingesting source lead including house dust also said mother educational status positively connected child health survival hypothesized educated mother may alerted follow disease alteration condition offspring real number lead-exposed child may higher muscle pain also another significant factor muscle pain back pain also significant finding painter battery worker study conducted kuruvilla addition peterson reported case lead poisoning presenting severe myalgia however mechanism lead induces muscle pain well documented limitation study used questionnaire mean gathering data thus question remained unanswered imposed missing data project addition question like addiction history parent parent may totally accurate answering data gathered clinic final diagnosis patient remained unanswered follow study could useful apply intervention reduce lead exposure evaluate consequence constipation management patient another limitation participant fully blinded objective study fact might cause potential bias moreover food water might contain certain amount lead fact considered objective study therefore evaluated conclusion study found relatively high rate elevated bll among pediatric adolescent patient seeking medical care constipation finding may require future study population size prospective screening elevated bll especially susceptible group polluted district bll testing possibility lead poisoning also eradicate need invasive procedure like endoscopic evaluation especially regarding patient history symptom
