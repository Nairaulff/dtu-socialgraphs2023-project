introduction sinonasal inverted papilloma benign tumor recur become malignant making early diagnosis surgical resection endoscopic guidance desirable although otorhinolaryngologist use nasal endoscopy outpatient consultation case difficult distinguish nasal inflammatory polyp pathological examination necessary make definitive diagnosis although time-consuming would clinically useful nasal endoscopy could used make highly accurate supplementary diagnosis accordingly herein developed computer-aided diagnosis system diagnose using endoscopic video image recent advance artificial intelligence machine learning technology provided foundation significant application medical field hand-written prediction algorithm long used aid medical decision-making practical application machine learning method prediction began subsequently significant improvement computer hardware performance led introduction dnns accuracy dnns exceeded conventional image processing method imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge eventually surpassing accuracy human image recognition nevertheless large amount data typically required train dnn model application diagnosis rare disease considered challenging best knowledge previous study utilized dnns diagnose using endoscopic video stream therefore study aimed investigate whether dnn model used improve accuracy endoscopic diagnosis moreover compared dnn model assessment performed various otorhinolaryngologist determine practicability notably best knowledge first study demonstrate feasibility dnn model diagnosis using video endoscopy material method
