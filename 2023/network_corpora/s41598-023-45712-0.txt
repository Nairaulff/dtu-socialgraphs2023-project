introduction various international organizations/institutions world health organization united nation world bank organization economic cooperation development oecd european commission among others turned world attention population aging pace aging accelerated past decade expected accelerate even faster next two decade similarly portugal expected among oecd country population aging occur quickly individual living longer observed increase demographic indicator life expectancy birth however even though people live longer extra year life often unhealthy finding emerges comparing demographic indicator life expectancy birth healthy life year birth number year individual expected live without disease disability example european union number healthy life year birth estimated 65.1 woman 64.2 men represents approximately 77.5 woman 81.8 men total life expectancy birth according data eurostat determining healthy life year population aged older whose prevalence chronic disease disability higher number year healthy life age represented demographic indicator healthy life year estimated 10.4 woman 6.9 portugal 10.2 men 7.9 portugal representing approximately 47.7 woman 55.7 men total life expectancy year age corresponding demographic indicator life expectancy according data eurostat portugal much lower position ranking country concerning demographic indicator estimated total life expectancy age 30.9 42.7 woman men respectively reduction number healthy life year significantly impact individual aged older related high prevalence multiple complex chronic disease multimorbidity cause disability dependency systematic analysis regarding global burden disease study reported chronic disease accounted nine top ten cause death worldwide national health service report showed portuguese population multimorbidity two chronic disease three four chronic disease already reported one chronic disease report found multimorbidity increase age prevalent woman men according work developed rodrigues author reported even higher prevalence multimorbidity among individual aged older estimated 78.3 portuguese population sample used research estimate reported age group 65–69 70–74 75–79 year older 72.8 78.2 81.9 83.4 respectively individual multimorbidity need long-term care provided multidisciplinary team provide integration continuity care however health system europe care currently organized around specific disease intervention often accomplished improve clinical outcome unfortunately care approach doe adequately respond need individual suffering multimorbidity since care focusing managing single disease may impractical irrelevant even harmful regard need health system design provide person-centered care aligned need preference recipient emerged person-centered

increase likelihood older adult presenting functional problem greater complexity seems increase leading greater need nursing care finding already reported people get older may experience range physical cognitive change affect ability perform daily living activity dressing cooking cleaning driving decline functional capacity due various factor including natural age-related change body development chronic health condition environmental factor living condition access health care thus association type functional capacity age reported research aligned found researcher also reported significant evidence functional decline loss independence people age regarding measure association score qol latent factor variable age result suggests age increase quality life interviewee seems decrease also expected stated researcher mainly due due health problem financial difficulty social isolation however important mention older adult may experience improved quality life age mainly maintain physical health regular exercise healthy diet managing chronic health condition properly also reported scientific literature topic finally concerning association score sat latent factor variable age result suggests age increase satisfaction nursing care delivered interviewee seems decrease however relationship expected older adult tend satisfied impact worsening functional problem may quality life finding also corroborated researcher regarding mean score obtained sample based fsw value inferred cfa func-qol-sat model result seem suggest interviewee somewhat satisfied nursing care provided average score greater seems revealing positive effect care health condition finding reinforces importance providing best possible nursing care patient and/or caregiver family friend effectively improves level rehabilitation readaptation reintegration preferably home sample comprised individual aged older residing community nursing care planning based functional capacity quality life patient satisfaction indicator seems become coherent real nursing care need individual make possible encode wide range information patient possible decide appropriate nursing intervention nursing resource made available summary taking account strong association found research func qol sat latent factor extreme relevance provision nursing care studied population group emerges care promoter positive change functional condition quality life especially age advance context need person-centered nursing care setting highlighted discussed several researcher ensuring integrity continuity care making comprehensive capable effectively responding real need older adult whose multimorbidity prevalent throughout life cycle measuring patient satisfaction involving standardized assessment functional capacity quality life nursing-sensitive outcome indicator provides person-reported assessment allows deep understanding person life value priority preference important better management health condition conclusion patient satisfaction seems significant indicator health care quality assessment sensitive nursing care according theoretical model developed author conceived ncpf also considered several model outcome nursing service primary determinant overall satisfaction care experience model developed research resulting finding suggest patient satisfaction indicator used evaluate contribution nursing profession reference surplus value sustainability health system since care provided effectively produce change patient condition multimorbidity finally functional capacity quality life assessment seem significant predictor patient satisfaction nursing care major limitation research related fact longitudinal study possible perform long-term follow-up assessment might identify cause-effect relationship delivery nursing care effect interviewee health condition
