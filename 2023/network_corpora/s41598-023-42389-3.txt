introduction cnidarian need specific lighting condition thrive coral sea anemone example often form endosymbiotic relationship dinoflagellate family symbiodiniaceae nurture seek shallow bright water non-symbiotic cnidarian prefer deeper darker environment similarly distinctive light preference also found photosymbiotic non-symbiotic individual within single cnidarian specie example previous study photosymbiotic sea anemone aiptasia showed anemone move towards white light low intensity blue light thus photosymbiotic cnidarian may evolved strategy continuously seek ideal light environment optimize photosynthesis rate symbionts failure find optimal light environment disastrous stressful light condition i.e short wavelength high-intensity light damage photosystems symbionts resulting breakdown symbiosis however study assessing behaviour response light sparse better understand photosymbiotic cnidarian evolved protect symbionts light stress studied aiptasia investigated whether display differential phototactic behaviour depending symbiosis status nature light encounter result discussion first exposed non-symbiotic photosymbiotic aiptasia polyp polychromatic light comprising

image cnidarian blue light affect numerous behaviour including spawning locomotion swimming pattern larva tentacle contraction study show host display negative phototactic behaviour away blue light source also perceive direction despite lacking specialized eye structure since sensitivity blue light widespread amongst cnidaria likely share common blue light sensing system already present last common ancestor indeed multiple photoreceptor protein family notably opsin cryptochromes shared amongst cnidaria importance blue light detection role photosymbiosis largely unknown interestingly aiptasia three opsin exclusively expressed high level symbiotic polyp hypothesize observed negative phototaxis photosymbiotic aiptasia away blue light conveyed least one opsin seems opsin enable aiptasia polyp sense ultimately avoid light environment high blue light component however without testing hypothesis vitro characterization knock-out study comparable ablated expression opsin remains purely speculative alternatively since aposymbiotic animal kept constant darkness photoreceptors may expressed therefore animal lack response light however gornik showed aiptasia photoreceptors baseline expression actively expressed even constant darkness thus complete lack photoreception aposymbiotic animal unlikely another possible mechanism could explain negative phototaxis observed photosymbiotic aiptasia may sense light-induced damage symbionts via cascade signal stimulates polyp migration conceivable host cell could perceive reactive oxygen specie leak photodamaged symbionts following light stress host cell could communicate signal surrounding tissue eventually causing polyp move away damaging light source sensory system may exist nevertheless postulate doe play role negative phototaxis symbiotic aiptasia based wavelength timing behaviour show symbiotic aiptasia react blue light within first minute exposure make highest impact symbiont photosystem even highly photosensitive strain breviolum psygmophilum ccmp2459 formerly ist-type take least min intense irradiation obliterate photosynthetic activity recently described photosymbiotic aiptasia perceives high low-intensity white light orchestrate optimal condition photosynthesis symbionts moving toward light source result show aiptasia also exhibit negative phototaxis away blue light source maintenance optimal light condition crucial stabilizing symbiosis cnidarian symbionts excessive light strain photosystem symbionts cause photodamage thus postulate aiptasia polyp posse negative phototaxis protect symbionts photodamage considerable advantage aiptasia use blue light proxy sunlight since example red light uv-a uv-b absorbed easily seawater contrast blue light 400–500 penetrates ocean water efficiently traveling deep seems instead evolving complex photoprotective system would monitor different wavelength polychromatic light aiptasia developed sensory system photoprotection tuned
