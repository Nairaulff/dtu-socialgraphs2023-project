introduction since outbreak march covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted perinatal care main concern pointed possible transmission infection mother tested positive covid-19 infant perinatal early postnatal period concern justified initial lack knowledge virulence effect novel virus led disruption practice recognized crucial maternal bonding breastfeeding initiation skin-to-skin rooming-in disruption breastfeeding initiation coupled initial concern viral transmission via breast milk dyad proximity significantly impacted breastfeeding rate hospital stay discharge result increased reliance breast milk substitute occurred however many author demonstrated safety breastfeeding even maternal covid-19 infection nowadays concern choice formulated milk seem unjustified furthermore breastfeeding provides optimum nutrition neonate protects infant infection even case sars-cov-2 indeed demonstrated breast milk doe contain complete viral particle ability replicate instead contains antibody neutralizing capacity case mother infected virus however duration extent effect still debated due heterogeneity study reduce possibility mother-to-child transmission many scientific society hospital recommended sars-cov-2 positive mother adopt practice distancing baby use personal protective equipment mask glove rooming-in breastfeeding however effectiveness preventive measure reducing

discussion objective systematic review meta-analysis evaluate proportion infant born mother covid-19 tested positive sars-cov-2 first day birth according present finding sars-cov-2 infection among neonate born infected mother found 2.3 indicating mother-to-child transmission neonatal period appears relatively low consistent previously published data sensitivity analysis reported mother-to-child transmission rate although slightly reduced statistically differ found main meta-analysis confirming applicability study result moreover statistical heterogeneity reduced -test confirming although three study extreme result represented source statistical heterogeneity main meta-analysis significantly influence result pooled analysis present meta-analysis collected data high-income country similar infant mortality morbidity rate similar healthcare delivery system despite restriction inclusion criterion study mother-to-child transmission rate sars-cov-2 infection first month life appears overlap described paper included also low- middle-income country indeed review gupta al. composite percentage positive infant born sars-cov-2 positive mother appears accordingly allotey conducted systematic review meta-analysis including study cohort study case series case report respectively independently prospective retrospective data collection country income reported overall percentage sars-cov-2 positivity baby born mother covid- therefore result indicate similar infection rate considering study performed exclusively study performed exclusively suggesting infection rate remains relatively low even presence transmissible variant sars-cov-2 identified indeed since first pandemic wave numerous variant sars-cov-2 characteristic virulence contagiousness step worth understanding emergence highly contagious variant omicron variant appeared may also affected percentage infant tested positive birth among neonate tested positive sars-cov-2 present study needed oxygen supplementation and/or ventilatory support result line several study reported favourable outcome delivery sars-cov-2 positive neonate described systematic review garcia symptom covid-19 neonatal period appear mild low mortality rate mainly associated occurrence comorbidities raschetti reported 55.7 covid-19 positive newborn symptomatic much higher percentage found garcia liguoro al. ranging difference available study could due difficulty discriminating whether severe clinical course result induced delivery caesarean section imposed severe clinical condition mother associated neonatal complication connected preterm delivery mode delivery critical maternal condition time delivery rather real direct effect virus infant organism fact data support balance potential risk postnatal transmission virus mother decisively outweighed well-known benefit skin-to-skin contact rooming-in practice breastfeeding fact since first wave pandemic several international institution including issued guideline recommend precautionary separation infected mother child international policy significant relevance protecting bonding dyad beneficial effect breastfeeding even time lack knowledge led government institution individual country promote mother-baby separation given rapidly changing recommendation perinatal practice particularly beginning pandemic incomplete consistency perinatal policy recommendation best practice conducted sub-analysis investigate whether rooming-in practice associated increased positivity rate sars-cov-2 percentage neonate born mother covid-19 infection result present study indicate neonate roomed separated mother showed similar rate sars-cov-2 positivity confirming safety rooming-in practice whose major role promoting maternal infant bonding breastfeeding widely acknowledged contrary kollikonda conducted systematic review including study published november reported 19.4 roomed-in infant tested positive compared 1.67 isolated one author hypothesized high positivity rate associated practice rooming-in could partially due inconsistent use protective device mask addition implementation inadequate air isolation measure moreover considering practice skin-to-skin contact sars-cov-2 positive mother associated increased positivity rate speculation related prolonged proximity sars-cov-2 positive mother occurs rooming-in rather kangaroo mother care indication foresee mother follow preventive measure reduce probability transmitted infection measure mainly concern using face mask glove recommendation distance keep neonate even room hand hygiene washing effectiveness measure preventing infection clearly demonstrated widely recommended almost supranational institution local government concerning particular situation hospitalization birth indication measure adopt defined hospital policy often determined implementation first part pandemic sub-analysis showed use two preventive measure correlated trend towards reduction percentage infant tested positive hospitalization two measure 3.2 either one measure similarly rooming-in adopting least two preventive measure resulted rate mother-to-child infection 1.9 one preventive measure taken observation underline efficacy implementing protective measure term social hospital life limit spread infection new variant sars-cov-2 still causing concern due high contagiousness time several government declared end health emergency removing effective preventive measure community including use face mask social distancing maternity ward woman arrive delivery positive virus little known effect highly contagious variant neonate review present least limitation firstly nine study could retrieved therefore assessed eligibility included even study neonate defined infected considering result single nasopharyngeal swab although aware following indication single positive nasopharyngeal swab especially early postnatal period synonymous certain infection timing neonate infection considered moreover result extended low- middle-income country finally possible accurately ass risk infection associated newer sars-cov-2 variant hand believe also important strength since included prospective study thus limiting heterogeneity included report moreover analysed possible role rooming-in preventive hygiene measure high-resource country conclusion result meta-analysis confirm low rate sars-cov-2 perinatal infection high-income country moreover based present finding reason prevent infant-mother proximity rooming-in breastfeeding even event re-emerging new pandemic wave case preventive measure viral transmission crucial containing infection neonate looking forward towards reduction adverse health outcome peculiar fragile group absence data adverse effect infection neurodevelopment later stage life
