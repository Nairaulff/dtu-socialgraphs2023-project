introduction domestic violence refers violence abusive behavior occurs domestic environment including violence partner child adolescent elderly recently intimate partner violence ipv specific type domestic abuse received growing attention global scholarship ipv typically defined conduct harm another person physically psychologically sexually involved intimate relationship—usually marriage cdc center disease control prevention report reflects proportion woman suffering form ipv 2016/2017 47.3 proportion men far behind 44.2 according world health organization approximately woman worldwide experienced physical and/or sexual violence intimate partner husband previous month study china using local sample estimated incidence rate ipv national incidence rate ipv remains unknown due absence reliable nationwide survey data study considered ipv sensitive issue suggested degree underreporting survey data specific finding report woman underreport ipv roughly men likely woman underreport regarding specific explanation underreporting victim may feel ashamed involved violence fear associating violent partner humiliate sense shame deprives victim dignity causing self-blame self-deprecation self-imposed sense isolation make likely remain silent underreporting due survey methodology also considered context survey conducted characteristic surveyor significant impact likelihood response research also show woman likely downplay ipv experience interviewer man people around feel privacy threatened particular emphasis harmony tight family tie traditional asian value may deter asian woman reporting ipv resulting higher rate response avoidance chinese woman likely underreport partner violence society may stigmatize victim perpetrator since china long owned face culture self-esteem social expectation relationship important chinese people tends act avoid humiliation especially come immoral behavior ipv due factor challenging researcher policymakers estimate true prevalence ipv discussion mechanism based ipv statistic may also questioned due response avoidance survey ipv may proportion non-response missing value making scientific prediction proportion
