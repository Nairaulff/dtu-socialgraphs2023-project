introduction seasonal influenza remains major public health threat globally substantial economic health care burden year estimated 3–5 million people suffer severe illness due seasonal influenza influenza-associated infection estimated cause 290,000 650,000 death every year therefore key understand driver influenza transmission identify intervention able reduce burden influenza empirical

associated reduced transmission risk may show importance reaching homogeneously high vaccine coverage rather focusing limited number district reduce opportunity onward transmission however spatial heterogeneity median number secondary case per region show active transmission cluster observer around limited number district fig analysis potentially using mechanistic transmission model needed compare impact different vaccination strategy study vaccine status individual case associated change risk secondary case suggesting vaccination protective infection might necessarily prevent onwards

although proportion vaccinated case dataset implies protection provided vaccine may perfect case reported highly vaccinated region associated lower risk secondary transmission suggests protection provided high vaccine coverage region minimize opportunity onward transmission reducing pool susceptible individual available infected vaccination history case i.e conditioned infected associated
