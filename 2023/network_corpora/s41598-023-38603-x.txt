statistic korea elderly population aged older expected account 17.5 total population importantly super-aged society expected reach account 20.6 total population rapidly increasing elderly population experience various health problem due physical psychological change life cycle point view therefore korea showing fastest aging population trend globally interest elderly high nationally due aging one four older adult experience age-related mental health issue common issue known depression may perhaps complicate older adult existing health condition trigger new concern case korea number patient depression continues rise expected rank first according mental health foundation united kingdom population aged older suffered depression men woman elderly depression help also reported people experiencing depression commit dangerous behavior self-harm behavior escape negative emotion depression could related suicide risk closely similar risk behavior thus careful attention needed elderly community especially experienced depression based research finding previous study demonstrated depression also closely related income level particular reported low-income elderly household worse health group even diagnosed depression symptom worsen timely appropriate treatment provided therefore seen important low-income elderly household make effort detect depression early prevent manage compared group study income inequality social support depression older european adult found lower income level corresponding fifth quintile higher score appeared depression—indicating role household income essential understanding depression therefore depression elderly societal problem overlooked increase burden caring person people around since depression common disease elderly factor increase depression exceptionally diverse previous study shown depression elderly closely related depression including gender age education level chronic disease social support health promotion behavior
