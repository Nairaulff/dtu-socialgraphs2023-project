introduction breathing exercise maximum expiration training respiratory resistance training inspiratory muscle training pilate well-known enhancing core stability physical fitness exercise may effective preventing low back pain athlete therapeutic exercise patient low back pain positive lumbar instability test addition inspiratory muscle training found improve dynamic balance healthy older adult resulting improved walking speed inspiratory muscle function thus breathing exercise could improve physical function human behavior quality life merely improving breathing function breathing exercise often combined motion limb trunk plank elbow-toe postural stability exercise combining exercise could lead synergistic effect respiratory muscle used respiration postural control trade-off
