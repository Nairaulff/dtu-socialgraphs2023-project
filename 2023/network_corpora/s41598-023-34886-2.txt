introduction current reach social medium platform affordances cheap easy content dissemination profiling targeting established social medium primary avenue information operations—efforts manipulate public opinion intentionally altering information environment substantial literature emerged studying tactic strategy information operation particularly twitter data widely available study focused campaign attributed individual state state-backed organization best knowledge prior work looked collaboration amongst state effort yet example international collaboration dissemination propaganda date back first second world war research explores evidence inter-state coordination amongst state-backed information campaign operationalized following two research question rq1 state-backed information campaign operating twitter collaborate across state distinguishes effort internal information operation term design deployment impact rq2 categorize strategic tactical mechanism underlying inter-state information operation e.g. specific role individual account support collusion extract interaction network amongst state-backed campaign operating twitter perform static dynamic pairwise analysis observed activity highlight varied structure inter-state information operation two case study finding indicate inter-state operation attract greater engagement intra-state operation suggest strategy employed state-backed information operation serve create maintain desirable information habitat e.g. engaging ambient affiliation common hashtags initiating network expansion increased exposure referencing controversial topic gain attention finding represent first insight tactic strategy underlying global cooperation collusion amongst state strategic information operation deployed social medium related work strategic information operation starbird use term strategic information operation refer effort individual group including state non-state actor manipulate public opinion change people perceive event world intentionally altering information environment tracing root radio propaganda 20th century variation even much earlier modern digital age particular today social medium landscape enabled effort unparalleled efficiency raised unique set question around response primary subset information operation aim disseminate inaccurate incorrect misleading information so-called disinformation disinformation operation strongly associated political campaign focused primarily social medium manipulation public opinion bot account paid worker attempt combat disinformation scholar focused effort developing technical solution automated detection multimodal disinformation e.g. fact-checking claim text identifying falsified image detecting deception speech facial expression video vast majority study reporting information operation focus individual state effort see e.g. event e.g. presidential election presented global overview information operation therefore similar work bradshaw howard report provides inventory organized social medium manipulation campaign country niblock compiled comprehensive summary statistic visualization publicly-shared state-backed information operation twitter study likewise provides global analysis unique focus inter-state coordination information operation collaborative work recent work human–computer interaction hci literature highlighted participatory nature online information operation interpreted dissemination manipulated information via lens online community psychological theory e.g. distributed cognition offer theoretical base examining social environment mainstream social medium platform impact collective behavior among social tie facilitate disinformation particular sociotechnical system allow information

centrality several central news outlet e.g. iranian state-controlled hispantv frequently consistently retweeted account linked cuba venezuela honduras 99.01 99.58 99.7 total tweet respectively thus iran may passively engaged interaction however coordination russia iranian actor actively disseminate content created russian actor e.g. targeting election content analysis figure explores primary structure inter-state operation russia iran observe iranian account actively initiate interaction russian actor approximately 96.81 activity inter-state interaction network retweets russian account majority affiliated internet research agency ira manual analysis tweet profile description indicate content primarily focused political politicized topic line prior work examining russian information operation targeting election instance profile description central node unofficial twitter tennessee republican covering breaking news national politics foreign policy maga addition election politics inter-state activity also focus racial issue e.g. iranian actor participate process disseminating material previously posted russian actor high centrality connecting three satellite community case study identify account role russia-iran inter-state campaign see supplementary material russia iran differ significantly term number influencers follower russian actor serve primarily source content iranian community url analysis also case study collect profile information tweet account engaged inter-state operation russia iran total account 1.83 actor country contain url within profile description identify unique url within shared tweet total interaction 15.28 total interaction categorize url type/platform active status see supplementary material among valid url see extensive reference international political news united state united kingdom iraq 31.43 majority linked social medium account defunct profile url content url url news outlet remain active complement tweet content 68.75 content url discussion conclusion rapid accurate detection information operation remains hard problem social medium platform globally evidence state-linked operation may collaborate collude improve efficacy campaign add complexity challenge work provides evidence therefore informs ongoing effort detect mitigate impact information operation deployed social medium highlighted recurring strategy tactic employed inter-state information operation twitter observed substantial subset coordinated inter-state activity identified supportive explicit aim e.g. targeting high-stakes political event seeking additional visibility regardless motivation appears inter-state activity carried separately intra-state operation resulting distinctive information ecosystem idea habitat relatedly discover majority inter-state operation exploit ambient affiliation hashtagging individual account network may tasked distinct role operation architecture overarchingly finding suggest information operation represent collaborative work individual level also state level notably analysis also reveal country size necessarily determinant scale observed inter-state activity smaller country demonstrate ability engage systematic coordination strategically expanding internal operation scope current work constrained several way analysis make assumption accuracy identified account activity e.g. account activity serf ongoing operation assume substantial observed interaction indicates strategic coordination ultimately emergence inter-state coordination way observed activity moderated planning remains open question furthermore extent current insight leveraged advancement automated approach detection inter-state information operation likely depend uniqueness inter-state interaction pattern vs. e.g. standard content promotion strategy employed traditional organizational account seeking visibility influence future work would benefit designing study compare phenomenon inter-state activity uncover likely small segment much larger-scale dynamic cross-platform multi-media partially-observable coordinated operation finding raise many question regarding offline interaction underlie observed activity way facilitated broader political agenda serve answer question distinct across country time work therefore highlight critical role policy international relation space also suggests whether state cooperate respond information operation social medium require transdisciplinary research policy agenda bringing together computational social scientist policy maker
