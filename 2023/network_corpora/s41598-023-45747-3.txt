introduction dental caries chronic progressive destructive disease occurs dental hard tissue influence multiple factor dominated bacteria early stage dental caries acid produced bacteria break dynamic balance enamel demineralization remineralization resulting enamel demineralization subsurface early enamel caries clinically characterized white spot lesion affect appearance also affect dental health due non-renewable characteristic enamel restore physical chemical mechanical property spontaneously present treatment white spot lesion commonly used method clinical practice include plaque control
