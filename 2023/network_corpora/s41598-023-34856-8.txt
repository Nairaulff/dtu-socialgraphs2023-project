introduction acute lymphoblastic leukemia common childhood malignancy pediatric patient depending success treatment childhood specific group young adult may risk late effect treatment gradually formed common late effect treatment include example premature mortality secondary malignancy neurological/neurocognitive disorder cardiotoxicity endocrine disorder growth hormone deficiency precocious puberty obesity bone disorder osteoporosis osteonecrosis social/psychological disorder adult survivor childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia asall monitored czech republic dispensary outpatient clinic outpatient clinic provides highly specialized preventive curative care patient continuously monitor evaluates occurrence possible late effect cancer treatment present however monitoring focused area physical activity one appropriate way preventing minimizing late effect treatment regular surviving patient may improve quality life cardiorespiratory fitness neurocognitive function reduce weight gain contrast sedentary behavior may increase harmful effect treatment incidence obesity development metabolic syndrome cardiovascular disease target group nevertheless expected decrease failure achieve world health organization recommendation occur asall although desirable target group lack study evaluated comprehensive device-measured movement behavior including target group obtain better understanding topic even though absolutely necessary many study identify describe basis subjective questioning self-report target group assumed subjective device-based assessment vary greatly compared

study may suggest amount mvpa derived accelerometer based shorter epoch may fully compatible current recommendation second study based smaller non-representative research sample third increased motivation awareness freedom movement participant long-lasting lockdown czech republic second wave covid-19 pandemic finally participation study based self-interest participant thus possible naturally active also showed interest joining study conclusion result study suggest asall even suffering disease childhood reach comparable level healthy peer study group consistently followed health recommendation device-based monitoring integral part monitoring late effect treatment
