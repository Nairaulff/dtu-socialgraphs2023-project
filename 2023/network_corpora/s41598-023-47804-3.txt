patient safety healthcare facility using various tool result may also constitute basis supposing improving teamwork climate may positively affect safety climate scientific report indicating number medical error thus also adverse event depends degree development communication skill teamwork result analysis shown smaller number doctor nurse specialization better teamwork climate may related characteristic statement part questionnaire smaller cohesive team work better together know better larger facility care patient personnel needed potential conflict poor communication therefore important improve cooperation therapeutic team many communication technique help healthcare professional communicate healthcare professional one sbar situation background assessment recommendation scheme essence present information situation patient condition concise specific way possible well recommend course action key indicate patient message concern characteristic feature allow identification patient his/her ailment description symptom brief presentation disease history functional status determination objective parameter e.g saturation blood pressure rhythm heart well patient subjective feeling communicates well action taken e.g name drug given recommendation suggesting problem may simultaneous request consultation/confirmation course action technique extremely useful necessary undertake external consultation related newly admitted patient also useful consultation within well-coordinated therapeutic team another scheme i-pass illnes severity patient summary action item situation synthesis strategy used medical staff briefing medical round first element provide brief information patient condition indicating whether patient condition unstable stable describe patient situation developing information clinical situation indicate necessary list action performed near future effect action taken also analyzed visualization patient condition intervention end recipient message summarize information heard paraphrase doe understand individual element message ask question paraphrasing sender statement recipient widely used constitute key element communication scheme health care addition paraphrase also possible use strategy listener repeat information obtained sender message unchanged technique useful issuing medical order crisis situation one important element influencing level patient safety culture willingness report adverse event learn error although question culture clinical area make easy learn error others people answered positively improvement area possible order increase knowledge medical staff regarding adverse event possible introduce appropriate educational technique aimed reducing number medical error facility would reasonable implement appropriate training model devoted importance reporting incident method preventing implementing method described literature i.e meeting case adverse event discussed morbidity mortality meeting held e.g monthly among facility medical staff talk interactive element may contribute improving patient safety would therefore possible introduce new element within existing training course related reduction risk adverse event discussing research result potential impact covid-19 pandemic result also taken account first devastation caused sars-cov-2 virus nursing home made medical staff aware high risk care provided type facility secondly epidemiological situation led closer cooperation various entity influencing education medical staff introducing change aimed increasing patient safety thorough analysis impact covid-19 pandemic patient safety culture long-term care facility poland would possible directly comparing situation specific facility outbreak pandemic using questionnaire tscs however reliable data polish facility outbreak pandemic unavailable time analyzing issue worth emphasizing one issue included tscs questionnaire institution patient safety year ago answer question indicate employee opinion activity undertaken facility improve safety compared year ago therefore research conducted long-term care facility poland future limitation study undoubtedly method delivering questionnaire institution ongoing covid-19 pandemic prevented personal delivery collection questionnaire medical personnel period study conducted significant restriction access health care facility particular long-term care facility people risk infection stay imposed restriction prevented people work entering facility therefore questionnaire distributed premise manager person appointed potentially factor increasing level fear medical personnel completing questionnaire truthfully could resulted overestimating result obtained individual statement moreover likely facility place high value patient safety chose participate study large number facility refused participate study facility send questionnaire back author study facility may indicate unfavourable situation related patient safety facility limitation study lack conducting repeated testing thus author unable comprehensively ass reliability questionnaire conclusion based study concluded polish version tscs may useful tool measuring climate teamwork safety long-term care facility result obtained filled questionnaire valuable source information patient safety culture facility management author recommend study polish translation tcsc questionnaire larger group medical personnel
