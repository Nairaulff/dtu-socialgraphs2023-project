onda also reported minimal increase t1d incidence japan 2.24 1998–2001 2.27 2005–2010 case per 100,000 individuals/year however result seemed elusive partly newly diagnosed patient might omitted registration system japan called medical aid program chronic pediatric disease specified category mapchd since nationwide all-encompassing registration system child t1d established japan mapchd data would insufficient national epidemiological study alternatively local registry system prefecture small-scale adjacent area would better extracting epidemiological data patient t1d instance recent study yamanashi prefecture japan reported significant increase observed annual rate increase 1.16 among subpopulation aged 5–9 year significant annual rate increase 5.38 2.34–8.35 large difference

significant increasing observed t1d prevalence covid-19 outbreak oita prefecture japan discussion study demonstrated incidence t1d child year oita prefecture rural area japan significantly increasing every year 4.7 past year 1999–2021 increasing trend t1d incidence oita prefecture almost consistent previous report asian country average incidence rate 4.7/100,000 individuals/year oita prefecture higher previous report conducted yamanashi prefecture 2.0/100,000 individuals/year 1988–2016 located middle honshu island surrounded mountain population approximately 800,000 resident japanese population classified nearly single race country yayoi people t1d recognized multifactorial disease therefore local specific environmental factor including viral outbreak play important role development t1d data oita prefecture slightly different yamanashi difference environmental factor may exist yamanashi oita prefecture however cause remains unknown asian population report zhejiang

every year korea overall incidence childhood-onset t1d increased 3.70 4.77 according health insurance review assessment service cause ethnicity-independent t1d increase also remain unelucidated increase t1d incidence rate korea considerably higher country changing population genetic pool unlikely affect increasing trend however local regional environmental factor might impacted increasing trend pediatric t1d nationwide study needed evaluate association occurrence t1d type viral infection many group reported t1d incidence child covid-19 pandemic meta-analysis estimated global risk new

similar increasing trend observed romanian spanish child contrast increase t1d incidence among people aged year found covid-19 pandemic 3/2020–12/2021 germany many study attempted analyze whether covid-19 pandemic affected incidence t1d nevertheless conflicting result shown various reason example symptom vary covid-19 child often asymptomatic mildly affected compared adult antigen test even polymerase chain reaction method sars-cov-2 detection imperfect therefore negative test result doe exclude previous mild asymptomatic infection addition substantial bias genetic susceptibility heterogeneity latency time infection diabetes onset might existed studied population moreover awareness disease might inconsistent caused lifestyle change lockdown covid-19 pandemic drastically changed hygiene practice social distancing reduced incidence viral infection especially child addition sars-cov-2 strain continue mutate time resulting genetic variation among circulating viral strain reduce symptom severity although greatly increase infection rate child therefore environmental change host side pathogenic alteration viral side could affected t1d incidence child therefore long-term study conducted investigate direct indirect effect covid-19 infection development t1d would helpful understand pathogenesis make prevention t1d significant change t1d occurrence covid-19 pandemic observed data however study limitation sample size relatively small compared previous study country two year survey covid-19 pandemic might short conclude result particular covid-19 rate child drastically increasing since beginning japan therefore study essential clarify direct impact covid-19 development t1d addition people avoided visiting doctor office hospital afraid covid-19 infection epidemic period might influenced result despite limitation preliminary study provides basic information incidence prevalence pediatric t1d covid-19 pandemic japan conclusion incidence pediatric t1d
