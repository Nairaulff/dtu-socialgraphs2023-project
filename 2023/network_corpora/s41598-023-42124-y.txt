introduction nutrition physical activity two essential component healthy lifestyle eating balanced diet engaging regular physical activity important maintaining good health sport nutrition rapidly growing field increasing focus importance personalized nutrition sport performance different sport require different type nutrition athlete tailor diet meet individual need addition normal diet sport discipline may require consumption dietary supplement improve performance however important note dietary supplement used substitute healthy diet supplement used recommended healthcare professional athlete aware potential risk associated taking supplement currently multitude competing product health performance enhancement claim sport food dietary supplement fortified functional food overlap shared characteristic therefore australian institute sport provided working definition compare product supplement single multi-ingredient product powder limited-volume liquid pill capsule form providing nutrient dietary component achieve specific health and/or performance benefit sport food food drink formulated help people achieve specific nutritional performance goal providing convenient form general nutrition support athlete targeted use around exercise e.g. liquid meal replacement targeted use around exercise e.g. sport drink gel bar fortified food conventional food vitamin nutrient added processing increase nutritional value functional food food enriched additional nutrient component outside typical nutrient composition purpose enhancing functional property inherent nutrient profile food increase public awareness sport major factor development sport food industry people become aware importance physical activity benefit healthy lifestyle likely invest sport food meet nutritional need sport food provide necessary nutrient meet metabolic energy need athlete active individual currently various form sport food available market including drink solid food semi-solid food protein powder supplement solid sport food usually bar snack provide carbohydrate protein fat drink semi-solid sport food usually shake gel provide carbohydrate protein athlete consume advised consume fluid electrolyte sodium variety reason exercise part factor aim maintain total body hydration deficit hypohydration worsen aerobic performance increase thermal cardiovascular strain sweat contains water electrolyte produced vigorous exertion warm/hot temperature active athlete daily water 4–10 sodium 3500–7000 loss hot weather exposure might result dehydration electrolyte deficiency reestablish euhydration status water sodium must replenished therefore electrolyte replacement supplement powder tablet ready-to-drink form good evidence use promote effective rehydration strategy restore fluid electrolyte particularly sodium potassium lost perspiration bodily fluid expanding market sport food created greater demand product additionally advance manufacturing technology allowed

require premarket approval fda supplement compound used sport raise energy enhance performance prevent nutritional shortage term sport supplementing protein supplement proven intriguing strategy wide range advantage including improved body composition lean muscle hypertrophy enhanced strength endurance physical performance study conducted ass prevalence supplement usage among athlete alexandria egypt concluded athlete use dietary supplement common type supplement used athlete protein supplement 67.9 utilization high-protein product becoming ever common among amateur professional athlete national international consumption risen recently due nutritious value people paying attention order prevent related hazard maximize benefit supplement intake hypothesis proposed vital evaluate proximate analysis supplement accordance information provided label present data revealed significant change labeled nutritional fact per serving laboratory nutritional data per serving 0.001 regarding protein energy carbohydrate despite lack uniform consumption policy international olympic committee international society sport nutrition advise combining resistance training daily protein

otherwise rest studied sample total sample higher total energy kcal labeled data indicates inaccurate information nutritional fact gym user mainly rely protein supplement muscle building improve physical activity according study done ass knowledge attitude use protein supplement among saudi adult concluded 48.3 participant saudi adult agreed high protein product necessary muscle building weight lifting addition 44.2 participant confirmed protein supplement good source energy workout gym user athlete consume high protein product mainly gain requirement help either build mass muscle or/ improve physical performance result table illustrated studied product recorded lower protein content labeled data except protein drink brand higher content labeled information 2.9 data may reflect adulteration inaccuracy labeling data affect main purpose consumption help improving physical performance building muscle mass aiding weight loss finding harmonized study done saudi arabia concluded

mainly protein bar powdered formal best knowledge study first one analyzed proximate content including fat protein carbohydrate total energy available commercialized high-protein sport food product available egyptian market interestingly data confirmed inaccuracy nutritional labeling fact gym user athlete rely complete recommended intake protein concern poor production control food supplement egypt also europe according bulgarian study stated many researcher support opinion real risk distribution low-quality product country production control inadequate concern provoked european parliament council undertake number legislative initiative field production control food product present study strength limitation acknowledged strength include fact study pioneer sport nutrition research area considered first one analyzes claimed high protein sport food product available market present study also notable limitation laboratory wherein analysis conducted lack formal accreditation notwithstanding meticulous annual calibration employed instrumentation undertaken deliberate replication analysis performed upon studied sample measure collectively served ascertain robust reproducibility obtained outcome also provided information fat protein content reflecting quantity content g/serving quality quality analyzed protein amino acid sequence plant-based animal source amount branched chain amino acid bcaa particularly leucine presence absence creatine quality fat composition component also product screened presence doping substance conclusion recommendation use protein supplement becoming widespread context athletics promotion grown recently nonetheless quality inspection must done accordance manufacturer labeling instruction database established regarding proximate analysis supplemental information analyzing available protein sport supplement currently commercialized market best knowledge first study analyzes nutritional fact protein sport food data indicate food label protein supplement lack accuracy therefore study raise need significant role considering purchasing using dietary supplement ass rationale using product studied product involved protein bar cooky powder whey vegan protein drink studied sample higher total energy kcal/serving reported labeling data increase energy result elevated content either carbohydrate or/ fat although consumer use product get recommended calorie form high protein product lastly protein supplement adequate tool athlete diet specialist must consider specific factor examined study making recommendation furthermore supplementation must always considered context healthy diverse balanced diet must never represent danger consumer must properly educated advised connection aim requirement recommendation necessity establishment council undertake several legislative initiative field production control sport food product set precise quality safety criterion future strategy associated
