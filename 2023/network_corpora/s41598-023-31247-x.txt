introduction coronavirus disease covid-19 initially identified wuhan city china december spread worldwide japan since person infected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus identified january eight wave covid-19 case experienced three emergency declaration issued period first second third declaration april may january march april september respectively covid-19 pandemic placed heavy burden healthcare system worldwide changed diagnosis pathway various disease including breast cancer national screening program breast cancer suspended early stage pandemic number screening drastically decreased many country addition expert committee issued recommendation triage patient breast cancer accommodate limited hospital resource covid-19 pandemic physician may avoided diagnostic practice patient low priority conforming recommendation furthermore symptomatic patient may avoided visiting clinic due fear infection situation breast cancer diagnosis decreased worldwide given fact decrease number surgery breast cancer pandemic expected already confirmed various country including united state netherlands turkey lithuania south india south korea japan ministry health labor welfare mhlw temporarily requested postponement cancer screening beginning pandemic therefore number breast cancer screening decreased compared furthermore number diagnosis breast cancer detected screening decreased compared average number 2016–2019 contrast number diagnosis symptomatic case change however impact covid-19 pandemic number breast cancer surgery inconsistent example study conducted gunma prefecture another using diagnosis procedure combination dpc data reported number breast cancer surgery change pandemic contrast study using national clinical database nationwide web-based surgical patient registration system reported number breast-conserving surgery bcs significantly decreased compared although total mastectomy therefore discrepancy result prompted conduct study exhaustive data reveal impact covid-19 pandemic breast cancer surgery japan additionally accumulation result various country including japan necessary understand global impact covid-19 achieve goal used sampling

discussion revealed bcs without alnd significantly decreased early stage covid-19 pandemic contrast type breast cancer surgery change using sampling datasets ndb included comprehensive insurance claim data japan whole various country reported decrease number breast cancer surgery covid-19 pandemic additionally several study examined change number according type surgery however result remain inconsistent single-center study india multicenter study five hospital netherlands reported number bcs decreased pandemic contrast total number breast surgery mastectomy change study using kaiser permanente northern california breast cancer tracking system database united state reported percentage partial mastectomy decreased compared among patient underwent surgery first treatment single-center study united state multicenter study two hospital turkey reported surgery type change among patient underwent surgery multicenter study six hospital korea revealed number mastectomy rather lumpectomy decreased compared japan three study compared number breast cancer surgery performed pandemic multicenter study hospital gunma prefecture another using dpc data reported number breast cancer surgery significantly change pandemic contrast study using national clinical database japan found bcs decreased compared rather total mastectomy result consistent latter common point study previous study high degree exhaustiveness ndb used comprehensively accumulated insurance claim japan registration rate 98.5 july national clinical database used previous study registered surgery performed japan recorded approximately 5,000 hospital consistent result study using different database exhaustive data strengthen reliability conclusion bcs decreased japan pandemic however mastectomy according japanese breast cancer society clinical practice guideline breast cancer bcs frequently performed patient stage cancer contrast alnd recommended patient clinically evident axillary lymph node metastasis therefore patient underwent bcs without alnd presumed relatively low stage without overt axillary lymph node metastasis although reason type surgery declined pandemic remains unknown propose following explanation first decline attributed suspension cancer screening suggested previous study netherlands breast cancer screening enables early detection cancer according study using hospital-based cancer registry japan number diagnosis breast cancer detected screening decreased compared average number 2016–2019 early-stage cancer detection significantly decreased similar result observed multicenter study japan relatively small sample size therefore decrease bcs without alnd may reflect decline number cancer diagnosis detected cancer screening relatively early stage second bcs may reduced avoid radiotherapy previously suggested since bcs accompanied postoperative radiotherapy requires frequent outpatient visit case mastectomy expected increase instead age group year number mastectomy increasing trajectory july unlike age group thus decrease bcs might offset increase mastectomy total number surgery remained unchanged pandemic result suggested bcs partly replaced mastectomy age group elderly adult likely develop severe covid-19 symptom higher risk death therefore may avoided bcs avoid making frequent hospital visit radiotherapy instead mastectomy may performed alternative treatment third neoadjuvant therapy may adopted protect pandemic-induced surgical delay due limited hospital resource several society including japan breast cancer society recommend considering treatment early-stage patient breast cancer guideline treating breast cancer covid-19 pandemic neoadjuvant therapy implemented united state canada however situation japan remains confirmed patient prognosis differs depending reason reduction surgery reduction reflects undiagnosed patient pandemic implies individual breast cancer left untreated systematic review meta-analysis showed delaying surgery week reduced overall survival breast cancer total number breast cancer surgery decreased age group 0–49 year 50–69 year july therefore worsening prognosis age group source concern contrast reason reduction bcs avoid radiotherapy replace neoadjuvant therapy patient likely worse prognosis since received alternative treatment bcs age group year mastectomy might performed alternative bcs thus total number surgery change therefore prognosis breast cancer elderly person may unfavorable compared younger person study limitation first information stage breast cancer unavailable since insurance claim data billing purpose rather diagnostic treatment purpose second sampling dataset ndb quarterly date impossible determine monthly trend therefore beginning ending point decline bcs without alnd precisely identified addition number surgery decreased month included sampling dataset would captured third observation period pandemic might short determine entire impact covid-19 pandemic breast cancer surgery fourth could evaluate adoption neoadjuvant therapy pandemic japan although important information inferring prognosis ndb doe information date diagnosis first treatment diagnosis additionally many drug used surgery overlapped could identify neoadjuvant treatment drug however study advantage highly generalizable owing use highly exhaustive database using interrupted time-series analysis sarima also advantage robust method control pre-existing underlying short- long-term trend enables provide hypothetical scenario intervention taken place referred counterfactual conclusion revealed number bcs without alnd significantly temporarily decreased early stage covid-19 pandemic rather type surgery furthermore trajectory observed age group result consistent previous study used exhaustive database japan therefore reliability result enhanced reduction total number surgery age group 0–49 year 50–69 year indicates patient remained untreated thus raising concern worsened prognosis method data source repeated cross-sectional study using sampling datasets ndb database insurance claim data since specific health checkup data since based act
