prevalence across world result indicate several demographical factors—age y.o. white/caucasian single unmarried gerd years—increase risk interestingly find risk protective factor towards comorbidities obesity hypertension dyslipidemia hypertriglyceridemia nafld found increase risk pylorus infection atrophic gastritis found protective towards result also indicate medication history significantly increasing risk protective prevalence america africa europe higher asia highest prevalence found africa middle east study indicates risk male twice female previous study suggested combination behavioral immunologic metabolic aspect especially men increase risk affect prevalence example erol karpyak matsuzaki suggest cigarette smoking alcohol consumption common men may increase risk men approximately two three time woman longitudinal study adachi also indicates prevalence men 10-year period increasing mainly due aging high bmi large diaphragmatic hiatus change however found woman furthermore previous study yoon kim sun kim suggest protective effect estrogen although study use animal model study show risk western white/caucasian population approximately two-fold higher non-white/caucasian population previous study suggested lifestyle factor anatomical genetic variance also explain high risk western population term lifestyle factor wirth abraham indicate difference risk attributed difference eating habit culture e.g high fat diet alcohol drinking western population distribution visceral fat tissue body composition western eastern population term anatomical difference previous study also suggest mass gastric parietal cell western population greater asian population explains higher gastric acid production western population moreover term genetic variance previous study indicate difference abh-secretor lewis histo-blood group may explain difference risk western population particular wirth suzuki indicate individual group non-secretors common western population prone study find increase risk may explained anatomical physiological factor may diminish augmenting effect diaphragmatic crus prevent gastric reflux previous study mention size important risk factor individual gerd etiology pregnancy surgical history elderly overweight may increase probability obese individual tend experience frequent intense reflux symptom compared non-obese individual anatomically obesity may promote esophagitis increasing intra-abdominal pressure iap inducing lower esophageal sphincter relaxation another evidence also reveals obesity increase transvesically-measured iap another mechanism thought involved related adipose tissue may act endocrine tissue releasing inflammatory cytokine leptin may exacerbate esophageal inflammatory process term metabolic disease obesity may cause esophageal dysfunction result amplitude reduction esophageal contraction peristaltic wave decreased lesp lower esophageal sphincter pressure abnormal gastroesophageal reflux consistent finding risk increased diabetic patient interestingly esophageal dysfunction diabetic patient also associated autonomic neuropathy involving vagal nerve especially patient hyperglycemic state diabetes 5–10 year onset gastric emptying disrupted due process trigger process worsened fact reflux symptom may frequent diabetic patient three major complication retinopathy neuropathy nephropathy longer duration study find hypertension increase risk finding first confirmed gudlaugsdottir find significantly higher systolic blood pressure sbp compared control although underlying pathophysiology still unclear relationship hypertension esophageal reflux confirmed observes significant improvement hypertension control laparoscopic fundoplication 3.5 year follow-up period overall analysis find dyslipidemia risk factor however study included analysis find dyslipidemia risk factor evaluate finding also separately analyzed several component dyslipidemia hypercholesterolemia hypertriglyceridemia high ldl-c low hdl-c. result suggest hypertriglyceridemia risk factor dyslipidemia component several study suggested triglyceride independent risk factor related humoral component altered lesp frequency transient relaxation also correlated high fat intake causing delayed gastric emptying time moreover hypertriglyceridemia significant predictive factor severity possibly related fatty liver insulin resistance chronic inflammation due gastric acid injury may cause abnormal lipid metabolism increasing yet several study find independent risk factor nafld also reach statistical significance risk factor study report nafld associated obesity nafld also increase systemic oxidative stress decrease antioxidant capacity disrupts gastric mucus layer causing esophageal mucosal damage increasing risk interestingly gastric atrophy pylorus infection show protective factor gastric atrophy classified closed-type c-type open type o-type according endoscopic atrophic border according kim ambulatory monitoring study indicates o-type associated lesser number reflux symptom c-type o-type characterized increasing number impaired acid secreting parietal gastric cell hinder gastric acid production lead hypochlorhydria lessen esophageal acidity contribute pathogenesis similar manner pylorus infection may present protective mechanism since pylorus chronic inflammation cause gastric atrophy decrease acid secretory capacity gastric lining observable o-type case missing c-type produce higher gastrin acid secretion however finding interpreted carefully since uneradicated pylorus still carry high risk gastric cancer several complex mechanism therefore even though pylorus protective towards study eradication still well-considered prevent incidence gastric cancer later life best understanding study focus meta-analysis prevalence find prevalence america europe higher asia recent meta-analyses prevalence gerd show similar result study qumseya also find higher pooled prevalence low-risk western population compared non-western population one explanation distribution may difference lifestyle typical western diet known high fat sodium calorie sugar low fiber fruit vegetable concurrently identified white/caucasian individual obesity type diabetes mellitus hypertension dyslipidemia associated disease nafld significantly risk suffering additionally meta-analysis show higher pooled prevalence africa middle east compared region finding contrast previous meta-analysis eusebi find prevalence african middle eastern country lower american country acknowledge several limitation study first find considerable high heterogeneity analyzed factor mainly study population characteristic various diagnostic criterion difference ugi study indication comorbidities along various diagnostic criterion cut-off value diagnosis second although diagnosis included study based endoscopic result associated diagnostic criterion endoscopy still relatively operator dependent-investigation may affect prevalence country third number included study several factor still study hence result carefully interpreted fourth included study mostly conducted asia study america study may affect prevalence risk factor interpretation study accordingly encourage researcher region asia conduct study regarding prevalence risk factor however regardless limitation study carry strength number included study participant relatively sufficient cover wide range geographical area therefore analyze worldwide prevalence conclusion find several risk protective factor classified three group factor including demographical factor comorbidities medication history demographical factor risk increased due age y.o. white/caucasian single unmarried gerd
