introduction childhood obesity important public health problem tends carry adulthood increase risk cardiovascular morbidity according meta-analysis obesity prevalence study child obesity relative risk adulthood obesity 5.21 time child obese given almost child obese year age obese adolescence important able predict early childhood obesity avoid obesity later life childhood obesity caused variety factor recent year many study reported caesarean section birth modestly increase risk childhood obesity although mechanism birth increase obesity unclear one potential explanation alteration gut microbiome infant born altered composition gut microbiome compared delivered vaginal birth may association childhood obesity birth rate increased worldwide raised concern birth risk factor obesity child racial ethnic background also important risk childhood obesity considered asian 1.7 time higher prevalence childhood obesity white/european individual japan island nation located east asia composed almost entirely single ethnic group traditional japanese lifestyle considered prone obesity study comparing prevalence childhood obesity across organisation economic cooperation development country revealed japan lowest prevalence however report found birth risk factor childhood obesity asia none previous study examined whether birth could risk factor childhood obesity specifically japanese population somewhat surprising considering previous study revealed association obesity various race ethnicity study therefore investigated whether birth associated obesity year age japanese

obesity-related health problem identification birth risk factor early childhood obesity study could instructive public health perspective japan study limitation first lacked information related underlying mechanism birth lead childhood obesity alteration gut microbiome thought main cause childhood obesity birth formation gut microbiome influenced delivery mode preterm birth feeding method early infancy examine gut microbiome directly adjusted possible confounding factor could affect gut microbiome formation nonetheless potential alteration gut microbiome may influence prevalence obesity resolve problem study needed research correlation obesity alteration gut microbiome birth second known whether child birth obese year age later adult obesity metabolic disorder although adolescent birth shown low adiponectin level increased insulin resistance several longitudinal study included investigation relationship childhood obesity birth found association longer significant 2–4 year age follow-up study needed determine whether birth-related childhood obesity truly increase risk future health problem conclusion finding study provide new evidence risk obesity year age
