introduction covid-19 still prevailing world except africa three year since first outbreak china numerous case study reported three year according reported data covid-19 exhibit following unusual characteristic pre-symptomatic patient infectious significant part patient asymptomatic infectious infectious patient detected polymerase chain reaction pcr test symptomatic patient supposed quarantined hospital home significant fraction patient untraceable therefore important distinguish symptomatic patient non-symptomatic patient numerous theoretical model proposed understanding spread infection covid-19 standard sir susceptible-infected-removed model pre-symptomatic patient assumed infectious quarantined patient included infected compartment thus infectious though contact susceptible people modified compartment model seir stand exposed model exposed patient showing symptom treated compartment incorporate incubation period infected patient model treat recovered dead patient different compartment sir type model provide information relation daily confirmed new case number infectious patient order overcome deficiency sir type model siqr model introduced quarantined patient considered compartment shown peak position number quarantined patient appears later peak position infected patient total number infected individual estimated number daily confirmed new case siqr model however provide information number untraceable patient supposed infected asymptomatic patient since asymptomatic patient treated compartment basis analysis infection process covid-19 shown onset ratio deduced fraction untraceable patient order obtain relation among daily confirmed new case onset ratio fraction untraceable patient total number infectious people propose new compartment model consisting susceptible individual pre-symptomatic patient asymptomatic patient quarantined patient removed individual include recovered dead patient accurate compartment considered

process among population compartment given follows susceptible individual becomes pre-symptomatic infectious patient rate contact infectious pre-symptomatic asymptomatic patient symptomatic patient

imply basic strategy controlling covid-19 quarantining pre-symptomatic asymptomatic patient well symptomatic patient introducing strict social distance measure reduce transmission virus developing effective medicine remove virus vaccination vaccine effective prohibiting transmission virus time paper completed available vaccine said effective prohibiting transmission virus effective medicine virus yet come therefore present result strongly indicates instead so-called with-corona policy relying strategy so-called zero-corona policy relying strictly strategy third policy using strategy taken note since infectious patient identified pcr test lockdown measure need enforced except social distancing measure fraction infectious patient obeys p+a =\left s-\delta -\alpha p+\left s-\delta

patient low possible parameter employed numerical simulation suggests fraction untraceable patient 60–70 late stage wave number consistent observed value tokyo seventh wave indicating parameter value acceptable shown fig number infectious patient time daily confirmed new case therefore order control epidemic important remove pre-symptomatic asymptomatic patient identifying pcr test
