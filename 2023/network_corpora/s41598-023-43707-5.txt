introduction prevalence osteoporosis increasing among woman men associated elevated risk all-cause mortality mortality cardiovascular disease respiratory disease cancer age year remodeling process reabsorbed bone replaced equal amount new bone tissue however age 30–45 year imbalance bone tissue absorption formation occurs rate absorption bone tissue eventually exceeds rate formation many drug approved treatment osteoporosis slow loss bone density however drug cure osteoporosis therefore essential goal reducing mortality risk decelerate decline bone mineral density bmd prior onset osteoporosis following start coronavirus disease pandemic people weight increased due reduced physical activity overeating increased stress result increase number individual attempting manage health simply focusing body mass index bmi past obesity traditionally considered protective factor osteoporosis resulting so-called obesity paradox however recent study shown multiple factor affect relationship bone adipose tissue fat adversely affect bone tissue adipose tissue act endocrine organ promotes bone resorption inhibits bone formation provides mechanical loading protect bone loss previous cross-sectional study weight corrected exclude effect physical load fat negative correlation found adipose tissue bone density correlation fat bone density varied according age sex however knowledge cohort study definitively established association high body fat percentage decreased bmd individual including menopausal woman men premenopausal woman thus conducted retrospective cohort study investigate relationship body fat decreased bmd korean adult adjusting effect physical loading fat study sought demonstrate managing body composition overall health rather relying solely

category body mass index body fat percentage full size table discussion best knowledge first retrospective cohort study confirming association body fat decreased bmd korean adult including menopausal woman also men premenopausal woman cohort study incidence decreased bmd highest nbmi-ha group greater risk decreased bmd compared nbmi-na group regardless adjustment made suggests even person bmi normal risk decreased bmd increase bfp high bfp result reinforce finding korean population study showed negative correlation fat mass bmd woman moreover previous study demonstrated fat mass negative effect bone mass contrast positive effect weight-bearing aligns finding cohort study therefore suggest personalized approach considering body fat necessary confirming bone health previous cross-sectional study using data korea national health nutrition examination survey fat mass positively affected bmd woman older men normal bmi contradicts result cohort study however cohort study following strength compared cross-sectional study first unlike cross-sectional study adjust confounding factor bmi rheumatoid arthritis steroid use cohort study included variable second confirming positive correlation bfp decreased bmd including younger adult premenopausal woman men year age cohort study highlight need healthy body composition management bone health young age previous study showing body fat distribution play important role determining bone density young adult future cohort study consider body fat distribution also necessary obesity paradox source confusion metabolic study recent study shown various factor affecting fat bone tissue connection clear variety factor involved association adipose tissue bone tissue including mechanical factor metabolic factor hormone mechanical association would best explained increased physical loading due adipose tissue however physical loading alone sufficient fully explain interaction adipose tissue bone density various hormone cytokine known influence interaction adipose tissue bone tissue aromatase synthesizes estrogen promotes bone formation reduces bone resorption secreted gonad also adipose tissue although adipose tissue thought contribute bone health mechanism factor involved well leptin mainly secreted adipocytes reported positive negative effect bone formation making controversial adiposity associated increase inflammatory factor like c-reactive protein tumor necrosis factor–α interleukin-6 inhibit adiponectin increase bone density additionally tumor necrosis factor–α interleukin-6 promote osteoclastic resorption factor vitamin level difference adipose tissue distribution visceral fat subcutaneous fat involved association fat bone tissue impact factor still controversial although difficult confirm effect various factor cohort study study still provided evidence body fat bone health negatively correlated study several limitation first several factor affect measurement obtained bioelectric impedance analysis inbody720 biospace seoul republic korea including hydration status recent food drink consumption physical activity level menstrual cycle however participant kangbuk samsung hospital total healthcare center underwent bioelectric impedance analysis measurement following standard protocol included 8-h fasting period urination within min prior measurement enhance precision obtained result second although observed association adjusted extensively risk factor decreased bmd unmeasured confounders vitamin vitamin status may contribute association third difficult generalize finding entire adult population republic korea majority participant current employee family member large company furthermore small number men underwent dxa scanning resulting significantly lower number male participant included study however despite small number male participant result showed association reduced risk increased bmd high body fat percentage within normal bmi range fourth nbmi-ha group showed greater prevalence decreased bmd compared obesity group seen table risk ratio decreased bmd nbmi-ha group lower obesity group considering female participant given diverse factor influencing relationship fat bone warrant investigation conclusion incidence decreased bone density highest nbmi-ha group risk decreased bone density statistically significantly higher nbmi-ha group nbmi-na group regardless adjustment made suggests even recorded bmi normal high bfp associated increased risk decreased bone density present increase number individual attempting manage health simply focusing bmi however result study confirm focusing healthy body composition simply bmi important preventing decreased bmd could lead significant implication development effective preventive strategy osteoporosis
