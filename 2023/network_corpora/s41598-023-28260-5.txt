introduction computer vision syndrome defined complex eye vision problem related near work experienced computer use visual fatigue digital eye strain term also used reflecting different digital device related potential health problem symptom related classified visual ocular extraocular symptom visual symptom include blurred vision visual fatigue discomfort diplopia ocular symptom include dry eye disease redness eye strain irritation extraocular symptom include headache shoulder neck back pain individual spend time electronic device computer laptop smartphones tablet e-readers contribute child also affected spend many hour using electronic device schoolwork playing video game sending receiving text message however use device even h/day lead development massive growth digital device become integral part daily life million individual age risk developed nation engagement digital device increased substantially recent year across age group moreover digital device use increased developing country resulting high burden due low accessibility low utilization personal protective equipment limited break time using electronic device major public health problem leading occupational hazard increased error rate impaired visual ability reduced productivity low job satisfaction review literature showed factor associated classified personal factor include poor sitting position inappropriate eye-to-screen distance insufficient working procedure improper viewing angle distance age medical disease long duration computer usage environment computer factor improper workstation poor lighting contrast resolution room slow refresh rate glare display excessive screen brightness imbalance light computer screen surrounding working room modern digital technology markedly influence daily activity lifestyle people effect reduced productivity visual musculoskeletal impairment negative impact cadiac rhythm sleep pattern although becoming major public health problem emphasis given particularly developing country primary study different continent however inconsistent finding prevalence among primary study therefore systematic review aimed estimate pooled prevalence computer

prevalence computer vision syndrome although primary study conducted inconsistent finding prevalence result moreover systematic review meta-analyses pooled prevalence computer vision syndrome therefore finding systematic review meta-analysis help policy-makers design appropriate strategy reduce computer vision syndrome-related public health concern pooled prevalence computer vision syndrome pooled prevalence line study done india covid-19 pre lockdown 64.3 however pooled prevalence lower study performed india covid-19 lockdown 87.3 europe ethiopia 73.21 difference might due difference study period study setting socioeconomic difference awareness behavioral change prevention computer vision syndrome moreover precision diagnostic instrument used record prevalence may cause wide range variation whether direct online survey majority paper used purely subjective question survey rely solely existence one complaint diagnose without connecting complaint time screen use long-term frequency complaint month study may exaggerate true prevalence additionally disparity may caused people use screen particularly smartphones screen abuse poor lighting uncomfortable seating position close eye-screen distance improper visualization gaze uncorrected refractive error prolonged continuous screen hour lack break viewing screen dark poor screen design study following limitation article published english included difficult determine cause-effect relationship study cross-sectional design additional database search science direct web science proquest scopus embase etc. performed due lack free access recommend funding expand database search moreover study reported country might lack representativeness conclusion nearly two three participant computer vision syndrome thus preventive practice strategic activity computer vision syndrome important intervention
