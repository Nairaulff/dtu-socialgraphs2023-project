introduction hip-knee-ankle hka angle widely used measurement knee alignment knee osteoarthritis hka angle defined angle mechanical femur tibia coronal plane based angle lower extremity alignment classified varus neutral valgus many report shown varus valgus alignment increase risk incidence progression knee moreover surgical treatment knee osteotomy arthroplasty important reconstruct optimal alignment correct load distribution medial lateral compartment total knee arthroplasty tka excessive postoperative varus alignment reported negative impact patient satisfaction implant longevity therefore measurement hka angle important throughout entire course knee hka angle measured full-length lower-limb radiograph standing position full-length radiograph involve risk radiation exposure additional technician training increased time image acquisition increased overall cost therefore method estimate hka angle without full-length radiograph discussed one method estimate hka angle
