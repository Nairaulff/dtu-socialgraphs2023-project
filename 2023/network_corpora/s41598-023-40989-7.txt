freezing–thawing dfi remained relatively low level promising context use spermatozoon art assessing effectiveness cryopreservation wisent epididymal spermatozoon certain limitation taken account related origin sperm method collection process freezing thawing significant limitation final effect cryopreservation described sperm origin although possibility effective use art epididymal sperm described many specie farmed wild animal also shown comparison ejaculated semen seems difference sperm movement characteristic lower velocity straightness linearity addition incision method used collect epididymal sperm favour contamination sample tissue detritus may additionally reduce post-freezing quality spermatozoon factor exacerbate damage result stress generated freezing process i.e cold shock osmotic toxic stress connected exposure cryoprotectants ice formation result impaired fertility comparison fresh semen reduction arises lower viability post-thaw sublethal dysfunction proportion surviving subpopulation clearly visible obtained result evaluated parameter similar deterioration observed except percentage morphologically normal damaged chromatin high mitochondrial potential spermatozoon another adversity faced male gamete basically every living cell oxidative stress described imbalance production reactive oxygen specie possibility neutralisation antioxidant however noteworthy right amount crucial process capacitation acrosomal reaction fusion oocyte nevertheless disturbance aforementioned balance thus excess lead destruction nucleic acid protein lipid
