detected rna viral specie including hcv hiv protocol used creation rna-seq data study include polya enrichment previous study demonstrated difficulty detecting viral rna polya enriched rna-seq data compared non-polya enriched rna-seq data although kumata colleague detected top virus identified study including ebv cmv exclusion hiv based mapping specificity concern use polya enriched data genotype-tissue expression gtex project prevents complete comparison finding particularly respect hcv study human virus moustafa colleague involved use whole-genome dna sequencing although detected

transcriptomic study also suggests observed chronic viral infection approximately 2.4 million people united state living hcv infection hcv infection lead cirrhosis 20–30 year increased risk hepatocellular carcinoma direct-acting antiviral daa therapy highly effective last decade highlighting importance benefit hcv detection diagnosis approximately million people living hiv infection however approximately yet diagnosed highlighting potential impact hiv detection population surveillance individual counseling within existing future research study population limitation study include lack information regarding hcv infection though ongoing effort return result study subject provide clinical test result allow evaluation sensitivity specificity rna-seq approach clinically determined hiv-negatives also lacking prevented full evaluation hiv rna detection accuracy also lack validation cohort infection-related questionnaire data although focused secondary use existing sequencing data data exist particular study population metagenomic approach available provide optimized viral detection lack control sample study would also addressed properly designed metagenomic experiment although study doe involve clinical diagnostic method believe public health implication virus detected justifies use approach leverage existing data enable targeted clinical intervention study participant study first identify rna signature hcv hiv peripheral blood copd-enriched population current former smoker secondary use rna-seq data study able identify signature viral specie pathogenic public health implication observed correlation reported infection chronic infection outcome host transcriptomic response secondary mining existing sequencing data disease study population using bioinformatic
