showed 64.6 japanese senior high school female student experienced fatigue common somatic symptom anxiety common affective symptom incidence female student prospective study similar thailand 33.5 common somatic symptom fatigue line japanese senior high school student addition participant experienced affective symptom concentrate different previous study different culture china dietary habit life custom data collection method used might cause different incidence across study additionally prevalence chinese woman aged 18–45 21.1 emotional symptom irritability common physical symptom breast tenderness abdominal bloating incidence senior high school female student current study higher chinese adult woman common somatic symptom affective symptom different chinese adult woman cause difference incidence adolescent adult woman unknown suspected female student senior high school suffer undergoing tremendous physical psychological change way adulthood addition regularly experience stress associated study well sexual fruitful health although cause clearly elucidated however suspected include abnormal concentration sex steroid serotonin γ-aminobutyric acid gaba sex steroid production provokes luteal symptom triggered fluctuation hormone participant study puberty adolescent female whose hormone instability increase age finding also support study incidence senior high school female student higher adult woman regard association exercise participation study revealed aerobic exercise yoga swimming treadmill exercise stretch resistant exercise could reduce yoga could regulate autonomic nervous system cns increase activity parasympathetic nervous system pns γ-aminobutyric acid gaba system participant swimming nervous tension would changed mediate altering neurotransmitter endorphin treadmill exercise could raise serum progesterone level improve release endorphin resistant exercise stretching reduction stress level release endorphin anxiety moreover stretch-induced estrogen enhanced expression glycometabolism-related enzyme protein helping regulate glucose metabolism sum numerous previous study expressed useful role physical exercise maintaining hippocampal hormonal level consequently hippocampal malleability knowledge mood regulation might reduce symptom physical education curriculum chinese senior high school comprising preparation activity sport skill learning long jump high jump etc jogging 800-m race sit-up 50-m race stretching jumping rope autonomous exercise focus health promotion regular physical-exercises participation china lesson per week min lesson meanwhile one morning exercise two recess exercise performed per day study participant took aerobic exercise weekly jogging 800-m stretching rope skipping finding support result age 15–17 year old female student class time per week lower incidence without moreover previous study revealed exercise habit min twice week may reduce severity premenstrual symptom woman aged 18–25 year result indicated physical exercise could effective reducing incidence severity woman aged 15–25 however previous study inconsistent study revealed significant association physical exercise previous study cross-sectional study cause recall bias might interpreted difference limitation current study first self-rating symptom could somewhat difficult female student senior high school student may increase concern reliability data second affect school absenteeism japanese female high school student however study investigated participant whether class absence caused might cause association class per week third waist circumference age menarche sleeping hour eating habit pain killer might affect incidence severity senior high school female student supposed studied future final notably high prevalence association physical exercise chinese senior high school study warrant future large-scale study evaluate impact quality life academic performance effective intervention mitigating among senior high school female student conclusion new unique finding study common phenomenon among chinese senior high school female student incidence senior high school student 33.5 common somatic symptom affective symptom fatigue concentrate respectively female student time class per week show lower incidence without based finding study suggested physical exercise might reduce symptom facilitate health promotion female senior high school student could help develop non-pharmacology coping strategy
