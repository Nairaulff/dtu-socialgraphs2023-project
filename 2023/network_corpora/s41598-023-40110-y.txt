introduction chatgpt-3 chat generative pre-trained transformer released public november openai element artificial intelligence—including natural language processing nlp machine learning deep learning—to produce alter text way mimic human writing speech among thing chatgpt respond specific open-ended question engage conversation summarize translate edit text provided user included information base generate original text based user instruction ability generate short report paper led concern regarding educational academic integrity important realize however chatgpt fundamentally information-processing tool language -processing tool mimic texts—not necessarily substantive content—found information base chatgpt also known hallucinate —to provide factually incorrect responses—although openai report problem chatgpt-4 released march earlier version software study investigates one particular type hallucination fabricated bibliographic citation correspond actual scholarly work document generated gpt-3.5 gpt-4 determine percentage cited work fabricated rather real along percentage work article chapter book website larger publication organization journal book publisher also fabricated citation correspond real work also ass prevalence various citation error e.g. incorrect author name article title date journal title volume number issue number page number publisher/organization name finally briefly investigate citation formatting error characteristic real fabricated hyperlink included chatgpt citation significance topic understanding nature extent fabricated citation citation-related error important least three reason first help maintain scientific integrity raising awareness problem minimizing investigator tendency trust chatgpt although author ultimately responsible work routinely justifiably place confidence software hardware without double-checking result n't manually recalculate output statistical software instance level trust appropriate generative tool however since task performed fundamentally different researcher must learn extent trust tool revise assessment technology improve expectation change second help student learn showing strength limitation software chatgpt student knowledgeable fabricated citation presumably likely take literature review process seriously work themselves—or check build chatgpt citation way lead accomplish many intended learning goal discussed later citation error may also help faculty identify case tool chatgpt used third understanding fabricated citation error help developer improve software method used development testing suggest discussion section citation special type text predictive word choice paraphrasing related technique may detrimental rather useful instance

substantive citation error incorrect author name article title date journal title volume/issue/page number publisher table third article incorrect volume issue page number cited work incorrect date

remains doe chatgpt generate fabricated citation bhattacharyya assert difficulty inherent large language model use deep neural network predict next word sequence text provide response based statistical pattern learned training… chatgpt distinguish accurate false information chatgpt relied solely predictive algorithm generate citation information however might expect bibliographic citation fabricated otherwise incorrect experience chatgpt suggests software may attempt recognize bibliographic citation treat differently regular text—e.g. copy exactly rather predicting/paraphrasing usual manner fabricated citation may therefore represent inability fully recognize specific part text treated bibliographic data sanchez-ramos suggest cause inaccuracy chatgpt related vast amount text data diverse source inconsistency error inaccuracy primary data argument entirely convincing since tool rely data harvested non-standardized text e.g. google scholar high fabrication hallucination rate true however inconsistency source document may explain chatgpt seems trouble distinguishing various date reported paper date preprint posting final-version posting official publication google scholar similar difficulty bibliographic problem may persist extent citation treated regular text rather type text special processing required implication finding noted introduction better understanding fabricated citation help researcher uphold scientific integrity help student understand importance identifying evaluating citing relevant literature user chatgpt cautioned check citation generates—and course evaluate quality cited work least two citation fabricated gpt-3.5 study—supplementary appendix citation 11.02 19.02—are journal whose publisher identified predatory journal editor publisher may also want ensure fabricated citation find way scholarly literature recent paper suggests unlikely problem final version published article fabricated citation likely appear paper posted preprint server institutional repository instructor tasked detecting ai-generated text—in undergraduate research paper instance—may find helpful examine work cited paper knowledge publicly available text detector check fabricated citation evaluating document presence fabricated citation distinctive characteristic chatgpt text likewise citation error generated chatgpt—numeric error particular—are also distinctive although best detector highly accurate advance generative technology requires corresponding improvement detection capability finally investigation confirms even latest version chatgpt misinformation found throughout generated texts—not reference list although made systematic attempt detect false statement quick reading document revealed gpt-3.5 gpt-4 continue generate assertion obviously incorrect see example topic supplementary appendix moreover five literature review generated chatgpt structured presented empirical study fabricated method result one gpt-4 topic even includes fabricated correlation coefficient regression coefficient value error potentially dangerous exacerbated fact chatgpt often stand incorrect statement asked verify gravel pointed chatgpt confidently wrong incorrect assertion may chatgpt fundamentally text transformer—not information retrieval system—and designed repeat behavior result favorable human feedback human likely satisfied confident response provides confident response correct otherwise
