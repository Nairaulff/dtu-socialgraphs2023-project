impact covid-19 patient yet understood literature mixed risk factor long-covid prospective cohort study revealed female patient comorbidities higher risk developing long-covid symptom consistent finding although comorbidities significant multivariate level jordan study found female patient older patient patient comorbidities significantly increased risk developing long-covid however nigerian study find association age sex presence hypertension diabetes multiple comorbidities experiencing persistent post-covid-19 symptom found older patient five time likely younger patient develop long-covid study show hospitalization significant risk factor developing long-covid agreement finding pérez-gonzález hedberg demonstrated hospitalized patient likely persistent symptom post covid

hospitalized patient complained fatigue and/or dyspnea month post discharge unvaccinated patient seven time risk developing long-covid vaccinated patient study however vaccine effect long-covid vary literature may related different study methodology time betweein immunization infection long-covid definition taquet observed significant difference development long covid vaccinated unvaccinated person study show vaccine offer partial protection example large study 1.2 million participant found long-covid symptom halved vaccinated patient another study revealed patient vaccinated two dos likely develop long-covid symptom finding support vaccine effectiveness preventing disease limiting spread mitigating severity importance promoting vaccination population level also important palestine given vaccination uptake among general population october 36.6 one strenghts study prospective follow-up based definition long-covid patient could reached phone completed entire interview questionaire day documented assessed new emerging symptom study limitation included self-reported data telephone interview rather physical examination raising concern information bias ability evaluate comorbidities functional impairment complication second although small number patient followed day due travel outside palestine inability reach phone may contributed selection bias third could examine relevant risk factor comorbidities encourage future researcher lastly based 90-day follow-up time definition long-covid following patient day would beneficial unable due limited resource conclusion long-covid symptom incidence high among covid-19 patient especially woman age greater hospitalized infection common persistent symptom dyspnea fatigue headache insomnia loss smell taste patient dyspnea day fatigue day risk developing long-covid symptom covid-19 vaccination appears protective developing long-covid symptom ensure patient long-covid symptom associated illness receive high quality care health professional must educated disease addition education campaign inform public risk consequence long covid promote vaccination imperative center excellence established provide high-quality culturally competent healthcare conduct research evolving disease educate primary care professional work frontlines
