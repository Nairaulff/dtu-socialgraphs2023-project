first report relationship age maternal mortality japan two important new finding extracted present study first ama japan found associated significantly higher maternal mortality rate noted among pregnancy younger age study previous study also reported increase maternal age associated increase various obstetric complication maternal mortality result present study similar previously reported however maternal mortality notably lower among woman younger year age point difference second clarification cause maternal mortality among woman year age although rate chronic disease malignant cardiovascular renal disease comorbidities increased among ama case rate involvement cause death low common cause death ama group study hemorrhagic stroke association hemorrhagic stroke rather stroke maternal mortality problem unique asian population half death due hemorrhagic stroke associated preeclampsia general overall incidence preeclampsia reported 3–4 increase 5–10 aged 40–49 year aged year addition year relative risk mortality reported 1.68 1.23–1.39 first-time mother clear incidence preeclampsia increase ama case older japanese asian pregnant woman likely develop hemorrhagic stroke adequate attention paid development hemorrhagic stroke due preeclampsia asian population uterine artery doppler angiogenesis factor aspirin therapy used monitor prevent occurrence hypertensive nephropathy pregnant woman year old among assisted reproductive therapy frozen-thawed embryo transfer egg donation particular reported risk factor preeclampsia present study proportion maternal mortality case age year among undergone assisted reproductive therapy low addition case maternal mortality due hemorrhagic stroke caused preeclampsia among assisted reproductive therapy-induced pregnancy case proportion assisted reproductive technology-induced pregnancy japan expected increase future increasing age increase dependence assisted reproductive technology therefore important aware possibility developing preeclampsia use assisted reproductive technology addition hemorrhagic stroke pulmonary thromboembolism infectious disease cardiovascular disease suicide significantly increased maternal mortality older pregnant woman suggesting focus solely hemorrhagic stroke cause maternal mortality study showed maternal mortality rate increased ama japan consistent report developed country however developed country higher rate maternal mortality among young woman well among ama case indicating bimodal nature association maternal mortality rate among woman aged year japan low united kingdom maternal mortality rate among pregnant woman aged 20–29 year lowest maternal mortality rate pregnancy among year age year increased compared among pregnant woman addition japan provides generous medical insurance coverage citizen regardless financial status pregnancy woman given medical checkup slip almost free charge visit hospital every four week first trimester every two week second trimester every week last trimester pregnancy group enrolled study almost exclusively japanese provided sample cohort prone bias age limitation study include first mono-ethnic study adjust maternal mortality rate several confounding factor although japanese insurance system provides background uniform provision medical care second although detailed data death detailed data survivor third information hospital resource infrastructure staff contribute maternal mortality risk possible determine whether high-risk woman benefit particular healthcare setting fourth relatively low maternal mortality rate denominator group relatively small making impossible make meaningful comparison group term mortality rate conclusion maternal mortality increased proportionally age japan particular mortality rate 2.3 time higher aged year aged 35–39 year addition hemorrhagic stroke common cause maternal mortality among aged year half hemorrhagic stroke associated preeclampsia fact considered woman become pregnant advanced age healthcare provider involved perinatal care conclusion maternal mortality rate significantly higher among older pregnant woman among younger pregnant woman japan hemorrhagic stroke common cause maternal death among woman year age half hemorrhagic stroke associated preeclampsia fact considered woman become pregnant advanced age healthcare provider involved perinatal care
