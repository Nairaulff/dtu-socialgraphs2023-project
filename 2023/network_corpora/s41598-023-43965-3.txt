introduction emergence antimicrobial resistance amr considered global threat according center disease control prevention main cause death least 1.27 million case worldwide million death associated amr monitor development resistance several surveillance system available global antimicrobial resistance use surveillance system glass example launched world health organization mark first global collaborative effort aiming standardized amr surveillance today country enrolled glass collaborates closely regional system like european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network ears-net central asian european surveillance antimicrobial resistance caesar latin american caribbean network antimicrobial resistance surveillance relavra western pacific regional antimicrobial consumption surveillance system wpracss infrastructure complemented additional national surveillance system e.g antibiotic resistance surveillance germany since data detected bacteria fungi well information resistance selected pathogen provided german robert koch institute rki interactive website allows generate report selecting among others year specie clinic/unit specimen interest rki provides externally hosted centralized database updated year currently data reported laboratory distributed germany included however analysis per laboratory supported instead region like north-east germany may chosen possible monitor local trend antimicrobial resistance—within hospital even one specific clinic within hospital furthermore cluster analysis allowing detection regional resistance cluster conducted overcome limitation provide intuitive application potential usage every hospital subordinated clinical department around globe developed gefaar—a generic framework analysis antimicrobial resistance method gefaar gefaar provides generic framework conduct interactive analysis antimicrobial data including basic statistic well advanced cluster analysis overview analysis workflow provided fig screenshot fig software aim reducing restriction input format minimum first step initial upload performed user selects file corresponding field separator common separator comma semicolon tab supported subsequent step user chooses column containing following metadata specie clinic/unit specimen date gefaar restriction column named original file see supplementary information fig different date format supported user-definable user selects date format expected contradict data e.g selecting dd.mm.yy input doe contain corresponding column note reported gefaar assumes every line provided input file corresponds one isolate every column subsequent common metadata column provides information resistance towards one antimicrobial agent sticking common nomenclature information expected coded follows resistant susceptible increased exposure susceptible analyzed according eucast application consists four main analysis module pathogen statistic resistance statistic trend analysis cluster analysis pathogen statistic serve basic overview available data selected year clinic/unit optionally analysis detected specie specimen conducted tabular output provided resistance statistic trend analysis based resistance analysis automatically performed gefaar context information processed every specie antimicrobial agent relative abundance category determined performing detailed

year specimen optionally clinic/unit optionally resistance statistic allow generate tabular graphical overview antimicrobial agent resistance per specie trend analysis integrates information resistance per antimicrobial agent available year selected specie addition gefaar provides option execute interactive cluster analysis one input data set diverse clustering approach available ordered heatmaps hierarchical clustering via heatmap dimensionality reduction clustering via uniform manifold approximation projection umap hierarchical clustering one common well-studied clustering approach robust provides detailed information observation similar easy interpret understand dimensionality reduction contrary provides complex approach diverse method available allow transform high-dimensional data low-dimensional space thus visualization mean plot possible gefaar implemented dimensionality reduction umap analyzing high-dimensional single-cell rna-sequencing data example umaps evaluated superior approach like principal-component analysis pca -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t-sne help umaps detailed molecular characterization heterogeneous medulloblastoma could performed considering four clinically relevant subgroup equally however umaps also enabled decipher cellular development spermatogonia infertile men however noted that—as umap nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique—the exact coordinate plot interpreted principle component pcas information resistance clinic/unit per specie well resistance specie per clinic/unit analyzed selected year specimen optionally order perform successful clustering data contain limited number missing value ordered heatmaps exclude antimicrobial agent information resistance missing sample analysis per specie per clinic/unit hierarchical clustering first exclude antimicrobial agent information resistance missing sample subsequently exclude sample information resistance missing antimicrobial agent analysis per specie per clinic/unit umaps generated even complete data stricter filtration applied first antimicrobial agent information resistance missing sample excluded subsequently sample missing information resistance filtered based experience commonly enough data left analysis per clinic/unit due strict filtration required umaps therefore umap clustering implemented resistance clinic/unit per specie cluster determined using package nbclust altogether nbclust provides different approach referred index nbclust determining optimum number cluster however considering majority vote approach available would result considerably increased run-time perform hierarchical clustering therefore use fixed configuration distance euclidian method wardd index duda optimize run-time maximum cluster considered observation available otherwise maximum cluster considered case algorithm fails determine optimum number cluster e.g model meet threshold required duda message clustering possible reported determine stable clustering umaps opted trade-off exploring accordance assigned cluster using different approach minimum run-time following empirically determined clustering strategy followed choose distance euclidian method kmeans minimum cluster maximum considered clustering performed using following approach silhouette scott duda dunn every approach report quality score possible number clusters—2 reliable clustering assumed available following criterion met least two approach scott duda dunn report number cluster optimum standard deviation quality score assigned approach possible number clusters—2 5—is assume superior clustering characterized peak quality score clearly differing score assigned thus high standard deviation taken indicator unique clustering standard deviation quality
