introduction researcher criminal career aim understand past criminal behavior predicts relates possible future offending context subpopulation criminal particular interest re-offenders repeatedly break law criminologist studying re-offenders continue debate extent degree specialization individual repeated commission similar kind crime many re-offenders specialize bank robber computer hacker drug dealer burglar tailored policy subpopulation policing rehabilitation may effective criminal behavior may predictable re-offenders tend remain generalist exhibit versatility however policy may ineffective several theoretical framework criminal behavior offer different insight re-offenders may specialize remain versatile example theory heterogeneity suggests rather person time-invariant characteristic like temperament level self-control predicts repeat-offending word difference i.e. heterogeneity innate trait attitude people decisive factor offending outcome heterogeneity suggests re-offenders likely generalist manifesting specialization external opportunity incentive consistent hand state dependence theory state life event social context significantly affect inherent propensity offend re-offend instance contact offender prison may introduce new criminal opportunity result gang membership increase risk re-offending even social context official interaction offender law enforcement instance via parole officer thought shape future behavior state dependence theory implies policy intervention example job program recently released criminal reduce recidivism time state dependence suggests re-offenders often specialize via process like social contagion learning perhaps synthesizing two perspective heterogeneity state dependence wikstrom situational action theory sat emphasizes dynamic nature criminal behavior function individual propensity changing environmental factor theoretical framework including general versus typological debate tend suggest either generalist specialist behavior frequently observed pattern criminal career time specialization conceptual framing merely theoretical interest whether individual potential generalist specialist implication potential rehabilitation specialization also seems play important role context organized crime gang facilitates efficient division labor context specialized individual may play key role functioning larger group practice specialized generalist individual observed various empirical study one survey literature note however generalist pattern offending common said variation study design data source scope scale measurement make comparison study difficult indeed despite importance potential specialization criminal career large-scale empirical evidence limited likely owing challenge procuring handling relevant data exception include longitudinal study cohort example andersson al. track criminal career group juvenile offender age find gender difference behavior falk study distribution violent crime conviction across swedish population period decade finding intense concentration activity small sub-population however work rather study whether possible identify coherent trajectory criminal career term persistence relate age rather specialization frame general study tend focus specific kind crime violent crime age group i.e. juvenile hence despite importance specialization criminal career policy associated theoretical debate clear need additional empirical measurement phenomenon article aim provide empirically rigorous accounting prevalence specialization large population offender observe difference socio-demographic attribute geographic mobility collaboration network position specialist generalist use complete dataset criminal charge individual small central european country six year specifically data includes 1.2 million distinct criminal event nearly thousand individual charged quantify specialization among population refine information-theoretic method tumminello cluster type criminal event frequently co-occur within individual career extension method considers often individual commit different kind crime define

specialize area sexual crime computer criminality use classification revisit previously studied association specialization socio-demographic attribute like age gender observe new association specialization complex characteristic criminal behavior also study difference collaboration network position two population difference characteristic specialist generalist may manifest significant

specialist generalist network criminal collaboration suggest human capital i.e specialization social capital i.e important network position coordinate criminality specialization criminal career important step defining specialization criminal behavior group different crime type according reasonable taxonomy assault battery example crime legal definition layman clearly related one would surprised criminal convicted offense course career computer hacking grave robbing hand intuitively likely carried person legal code tend group different kind crime reasonable category categorization always useful describing criminal specialization may reflect artifact historical evolution law structure criminal code also differs significantly country even within country time instance crime committed computer sometimes grouped category time linked nearest offline counterpart i.e fraud inadequacy using legal code categorize behavior purpose studying specialization evidenced existence widely referenced crime classification manual provide additional categorization type crime international effort harmonize categorization criminal activity international classification crime statistical purpose icc aim effort define similarity criminal act term co-occurrence criminal career way unsuited defining specialization indeed see data-driven clustering criminal activity doe conform categorization legal code therefore adopt statistical approach group crime carried criminal within individual career goal method facilitate categorization individual specialist generalist using data compare observed distribution co-occurrence crime overall population statistical benchmark derived null model null model assumes randomized distribution criminal activity across criminal grouping statistically significant co-occurrence different crime category within career creates self-generated data-driven typology crime type approach extends method developed tumminello considering number crime also number perpetrator committing two type crime explicitly method define specialist take following step first define co-occurrence network crime defined legal code within individual criminal career network two crime instance assault computer hacking connected weighted edge counting frequency one person charged two crime network quite dense need filtered word edge need statistically validated resulting statistically validated network crime able detect kind crime often co-appear career across entire population next apply clustering algorithm grouping node corresponding crime defined legal code cluster crime category instance one category includes crime fraud embezzlement forgery another includes rape sexual harassment finally use categorization define criminal specialist generalist criminal specialist commit crime single category across observed career otherwise say generalist carry analysis two type criminal differ i.e term socio-demographic
