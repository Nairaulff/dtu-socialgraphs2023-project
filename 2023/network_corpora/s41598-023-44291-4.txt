introduction significant change occurred since emergence novel coronavirus disease covid-19 existing literature provides mixed evidence impact pandemic mental well-being general population specific demographic young woman appear particularly susceptible adverse mental health outcome additionally pandemic-induced isolation change working style including rise remote working altered stress response influenced family dynamic among general trend well-being pregnant woman emerged vital yet understudied area concern pregnancy transitional period characterized considerable physical emotional change even pandemic change affected maternal infant health recent study reported decline subjective well-being people affected covid-19 pandemic consequently identifying predictor maternal well-being trying time significant implication public health policy making address study aimed develop machine learning model specifically designed predict subjective well-being pregnant woman covid-19 pandemic machine

emphasized aspect sense hopelessness may also influence decline well-being due decreased social interaction increased psychological isolation meta-analysis pregnant woman qol conducted covid-19 pandemic found partner support factor improved qol physical factor e.g. complication pregnancy physical symptom nausea vomiting sleep disturbance psychological factor e.g. anxiety stress depression pregnancy associated reduced qol another research suggests infectious disease epidemic pregnant woman may particularly distressed concern health social capital suggested positively impact health status knowledge transfer channel reinforced behavioral norm community cohesion recent study indicated community cohesion linked increased use preventive health care term health status social capital may also impact study several limitation first exploratory study using machine learning method examine factor affecting pregnant woman subjective well-being covid-19 pandemic study evaluate causal relationship therefore unclear whether improving predictor identified study would improve pregnant woman well-being second cross-sectional study based web-based self-reports small sample size may involved selection bias although stratified random sampling conducted survey yielded pregnant woman due budget constraint survey enabled collect data despite different period number people data used learning validation data used testing prediction made high accuracy believe qualitative trend captured third essential note well-being multifaceted concept overall subjective well-being rated 10-point likert scale doe capture aspect pregnant woman well-being however social desirability bias reduced using anonymous questionnaire simple scale fourth test data may include data pregnant woman however since usually take month pregnancy delivery rare woman another pregnancy immediately childbirth believe even test data contain duplicate number likely small fifth study retrospectively analyzed data jacsis finding may generalizable non-japanese population conclusion developed highly accurate model predict subjective well-being pregnant woman partner help pregnant woman sense hopelessness pregnant
