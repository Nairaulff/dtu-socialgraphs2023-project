concentration metal exceeding legal limit heavy metal concentration legal limit often reported academic study region fact heavy metal often exceed legal limit surprising since adherence legal limit overall food safety responsibility food producer consequently number sample tested usually small often lead false negative result although legal limit tested heavy metal exceeded seafood consumed strongly argues favour stringent seafood quality control croatia general north-western part particular regarding difference heavy metal content tested specie cadmium content patagonian squid significantly higher specie tested 0.0001 whereas mercury content significantly higher tuna fish european hake compared tested specie 0.0001 median value heavy metal tested interval median tested specie shown fig figure comparison heavy metal concentration tested specie full size image fact european hake tuna fish high content surprising considering exhibit strong bioaccumulation biomagnification potential regarding high content patagonian squid speculate result fact patagonian squid fished environment comparably high concentration cadmium may passively diffuse marine organism enter marine food chain level plankton microorganism enter fish via food addition according kojadinović bustamante cephalopod often express high level content due essential role heavy metal play physiological detoxification process level comparably low probably due reduction anthropogenic lead pollution direct link marine environment act sink thus reduction anthropogenic lead emission result

seafood conclusion study point population north-western part croatia could heightened risk adverse health effect due consumption seafood relatively high concentration tested seafood specie namely tuna fish european hake minimise potential adverse effect heavy metal human health advise limiting consumption fish specie especially sensitive segment population child elderly pregnant woman concerned
