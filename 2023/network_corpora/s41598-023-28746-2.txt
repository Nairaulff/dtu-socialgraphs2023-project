longitudinal study shown prism associated development airflow obstruction copdgene study approximately current ex-smokers spirometric finding prism developed airflow obstruction five year later population-based cohort study rotterdam individual prism developed airflow obstruction marott reported individual prism year old experienced increased risk hospital admission copd 15-years long study present study showed non-restrictive prism restrictive prism associated increased risk developing airflow obstruction year restrictive prism classified restrictive spirometric pattern non-restrictive

reported prism divisible three subgroup cluster analysis observational cross-sectional study copd-subtype restrictive-subtype metabolic-subtype rotterdam study reported prism encompassed least three distinct clinical group one progression copd second high cardiovascular burden early death third persistent prism normal age-related lung function decline previous report indicated individual prism may clinically heterogeneous criterion classifying subtypes prism remained unclear study showed prism split two subgroup according presence absence restrictive spirometric pattern assessing risk factor baseline lung function longitudinal trajectory one restrictive subtype obstructive subtype pathophysiology two type prism remains unclear detailed examination computed tomography post-bronchodilator spirometry measurement total lung capacity performed study however since non-restrictive prism independently associated asthma smoking history pathophysiology may encompass intrapulmonary factor airway inflammation bronchial hyperresponsiveness emphysema contrast restrictive prism associated high bmi thus pathophysiology may explained extrapulmonary factor obesity varied pathophysiology may underlie difference risk transition airflow limitation two type prism investigation warranted clarify pathophysiology incidence cardiovascular event mortality among two type prism present study approximately half participant restrictive non-restrictive prism transitioned prism/airflow obstruction category five year previous study shown prism fluctuating state copenhagen city heart study showed half individual prism transitioned normal spirometry year cohort study japanese patient one-third individual prism transitioned normal spirometry year similar previous finding result also suggest prism may fluctuating state even classified two subgroup according presence absence restrictive spirometric pattern strength study large sample size use multivariate regression adjust confounders however several limitation considered first perform post-bronchodilator spirometry study population underwent general check-up reason measure total lung capacity absence direct measurement total lung capacity difficult evaluate whether restrictive spirometric pattern actually identifies true pulmonary restriction decreased fvc may show true restrictive spirometric pattern may reflect airflow obstruction due air trapping study participant male therefore gender bias limitation study additionally excluded participant could followed-up year post-initial visit longitudinal analysis may led selection bias finally despite large sample size overall population individual transitioned airflow obstruction prism conclusion prism divided two subgroup according presence absence restrictive spirometric abnormality one restrictive subtype prism without restrictive abnormality latter classified normal conventional spirometric criterion associated increased risk developing airflow obstruction finding suggest need stratified management individual prism
