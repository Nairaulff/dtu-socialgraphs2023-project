introduction molluscum contagiosum common benign viral infection seen commonly child disease caused double stranded dna virus poxviridae family molluscum infects human epidermis causing dome-shaped papule average diameter 3–5 infection transmitted contact infected people contaminated object several study shown greater prevalence higher number lesion patient atopic dermatitis may explained immunologic change impaired skin barrier disease molluscum typically severe larger disseminated lesion immunocompromised patient immunocompetent patient lesion regress spontaneously time case spontaneous regression molluscum lesion generally accompanied sign inflammation including perilesional erythema diagnosis molluscum based physical examination observation typical umbilicated papule dermatoscopy aid diagnosis case identifying punctiform radial mixed flower pattern lesion vasculature definitive diagnosis made biopsy histopathology molluscum lesion may spontaneously resolve without treatment case resolve within six nine month may persist year periocular molluscum lesion frequently affect eyelid margin area near palpebral aperture may cause secondary unilateral follicular conjunctivitis superficial punctate keratitis although periocular lesion may self-limited need intervention beyond conservative management important understand disease also take aggressive form case
