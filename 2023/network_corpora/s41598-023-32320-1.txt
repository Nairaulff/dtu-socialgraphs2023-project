introduction agriculture essential part every country economy play decisive role income employment food security globally agricultural soil critical efficient production crop safe food meet need growing population however improving soil quality critical component sustainable agriculture given socio-economic political pressure improve soil fertility increase agricultural productivity widespread chemical fertilizer use beginning 1950s 1960s led increased food production significant environmental cost chemical fertilizer pesticide improved short-term food production however soil degradation greenhouse gas emission increase water pollution risk emerged widespread use consequently excessive use chemical fertilizer negatively impact human health throughout food chain example excessive use phosphate fertilizer lead cadmium pollution ingested lead osteoporosis excessive use nitrogen fertilizer lead accumulation nitrite plant nitrite combine amine increasing risk cancer digestive system methemoglobinemia severe case fertilizer use lead surface runoff groundwater pollution contributing eutrophication consequently deterioration natural ecosystem reduction genetic diversity given growing global awareness adverse environmental impact agricultural intensification pesticide fertilizer use alternative approach agroecology permaculture naturalistic exploration conservation agriculture low-input agriculture become important agricultural policy environmental management priority order achieve simultaneous action sustainable development goal zero hunger goal life water land respectively though environmental socio-economic cultural challenge associated sustainable agriculture require holistic response consumer organization food processing export retail

particular subject also shown repeatedly play leading role attitude farmer toward pro-environmental behavior hypothesis section therefore follows farmer toward pro-environmental behavior significant impact attitude second causal link subjective personal norm highlighted literature superior express society view behavior determines whether behavior perceived positive negative word broader social behavioral norm society tend guide individual recognize whether behavior appropriate exist special standard society exerted social pressure ingrained individual therefore farmer perceive pro-environmental behavior socially acceptable may feel personal responsibility perform behavior next hypothesis accordingly derived follows farmer toward pro-environmental behavior significant impact

investigate farmer tendency perform pro-environmental behavior line finding result sem showed significantly influenced farmer behavioral intention confirm hypothesis study found important strongest predictor behavioral intention nam model refers relative perceived rightness wrongness behavior individual hence farmer recognize pro-environmental behavior right would likely perform behavior example farmer feel use chemical fertilizer farm harmful perceive behavior extension harmful community avoid behavior pn-related disapproval study positive emotion indicate farmer sense satisfaction performing environmental protection behavior negative emotion induce sense guilt due performing pro-environmental behavior result effect supported hypothesis consistent finding according result concluded awareness consequence pro-environmental behavior affect people normative commitment fact activate performing performing behavior therefore gaining awareness environmental impact pro-environmental behavior first step toward achieving principle sustainability essentially prerequisite future survival humanity brings environmental problem forefront personal decision-making whilst neglect would limit pro-environmental behavioral intention result hypothesis indicate contrary research doe significant effect interpretation finding assert farmer renting land prioritize short term agricultural profitability expense negative environmental consequence action profitability sought stabilization pro-social pro-environmental community norm create specific pns economic factor especially developing country like iran take precedence factor personal benefit collective benefit due high poverty low economic power often prevail second important interpretation hypothesis shown descriptive statistics—more farmer high level education education level associated pro-environmental behavioral intention illustrates level awareness environmental impact subjective social norm regulate pro-social pro-environmental behavior therefore important sustainable agricultural policy-making ensure awareness raising environmental impact combined social engagement within farmer order establish social norm environmental protection thus long-term practical environmental management change within food system see example next confirmed hypothesis effect attitude farmer behavioral intention perform pro-environmental behavior hypothesis finding line result could interpreted attitude usually known precondition human behavior key factor revealing hidden behavior human therefore positive attitude towards environment determines behavioral tendency human key farmer behavior given attitude strongest variable predicting behavioral tendency expressed valence judgment negative positive consequence behavior higher value people judgment pro-environmental behavior greater tendency engage behavior result study corroborated confirm significant effect farmer behavioral intention confirm hypothesis accordingly social pressure contribute significantly forming behavioral tendency individual park provides people information need apply right wrong useful undesirable behavior also farmer feel behavior approved community member highest social status likely engage behavior word villager encouraged authority greatest social capital likely believe morality responsibility pro-environmental behavior result effect pbc farmer behavioral intention supportive hypothesis consistent higher person self-esteem belief capable pro-environmental action likely engage pbc illustrates ease difficulty understanding person behavior word pro-environmental behavior frequent farmer believe posse knowledge skill needed perform behavior respect training course locally run workshop might prove useful capacity building thus stimulating pro-environmental behavior change result effect farmer attitude toward pro-environmental behavior supported hypothesis corroborated finding finding indicates knowing consequence behavior determines individual attitude toward performing performing behavior attitude dependent upon positive negative evaluation person behavior farmer awareness consequence pro-environmental behavior influence attitude toward environmental protection example research use medium show effect chemical fertilizer utilization human health shown reduce farmer chemical fertilizer usage process attitudinal change result effect supported hypothesis finding depicts social space play significant role institutionalizing behavior among member society diffuse social pressure amongst community emphasize importance specific behavior becomes difficult individual work dominant set social norm therefore pro-environmental behavior would likely occur among farmer even without direct supervision generalized social norm pressure govern behavior recommended therefore work alongside greatest social cultural capital resource within rural community promote uptake pro-environmental behavioral norm conclusion study investigates factor affecting farmer tendency toward pro-environmental behavior iran designed integrative approach combining two psychosocial theory tpb nam integrated nam-tpb modeling reach higher performance either two applied singularly combined procedure account socially-motivated self-motivated driver behavioral change way study using individual model result show integrated nam-tpb model explain farmer intention towards adopting pro-environmental behavior indicating significant impact socio-psychological model explaining farmer intention towards sustainable agricultural practice find key variable influencing farmer adoption pro-environmental behavior awareness consequence excessive agricultural environmental exploitation driven paucity farmer-stakeholder knowledge around environmental impact hence lack capacity plan sustainably concept capacity-building knowledge exchange concerning relationship personal action agricultural policy strategy condition economic stress long-term environmental change thus key priority iranian governance body insight applicable range agricultural development context across world iran elsewhere developing world agricultural policy prioritize short-term economic food quantity benefit action including increasing fossil-fuel based fertilizer pesticide input burning plant residue promoted policy supply push central government authority policy action aimed improving annual yield ensuring food security condition external pressure case iran condition economic sanction alongside declining productivity condition water stress heat stress extreme weather event flood resulting anthropogenic climate change yet commonly understood agricultural environmental scientist agricultural intensification without remediation action degrades quality common pool land water ecosystem service resource time farmer largely unaware fact key concern sustainable food-systems management recommend case educational training activity workshop extension course articulate longer-term impact context farm livelihood sustainability would provide key mean ensure uptake pro-environmental behavior agricultural practice however iran developing nation public sector take responsibility agricultural skill development state policy remain focused short-term productivity self-sufficiency creates stable social norm short-termist agricultural development moral responsibility long-term sustainable development agricultural sector therefore lie central government term agricultural supply education policy improvement ethically motivated pro-social commitment farmer sustainable agricultural practice made condition supply chain management farmer training emphasize pro-environmental behavior practice concert one another combined supply chain farm education strategy emphasizes long-term sustainable agricultural planning implemented research show would little need direct monitoring farmer activity social pressure institutionalize sustainable practice persistent social norm amongst farmer stakeholder network rural community advantage approach produce considerably social economic cost government need formal regulatory oversight coercive control manage environmental impact saving could instead used provide low-interest loan subsidy farmer purchase green fertilizer modern irrigation technology diversify rural economy away intensive agricultural development stimulate sustainable practice line emergent pro-environmental social norm
