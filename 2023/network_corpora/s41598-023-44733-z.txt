introduction diet fat salt sugar necessity daily life important source essential macronutrients however excess intake diet fat salt sugar closely associated prevalence non-communicable chronic disease ncds high blood pressure cardiovascular disease cvds literature based population published lancet demonstrated decreased consumption fiber-rich food increased consumption high-fat high-salt high-sugar convenience food unhealthy lifestyle behavior contribute increased risk cvds highlight necessity geographically targeted intervention strategy ameliorate diet quality mitigate diet-related burden cvds many industrialized country manufactured food sugar-sweetened beverage primary source salt saturated fat sugar taxation unhealthy luxury food drink item product reformulation targeted reducing salt saturated fat sugar proven effective however alternative strategy needed low-middle-income country china sodium fat/oil intake mainly food prepared home population-based sodium fat/oil reduction emerged effective strategy managing hypertension cardiovascular disease obesity college canteen place centralized dining one crucial stage developing healthy personal habit higher education diet college student left family environment also undergo change impact health short long term however intake oil salt sugar related individual eating behavior canteen staff health literacy cooking

additionally covered attitude toward using substance cooking habit dietary behavior reduce consumption daily life compensated lack comprehensive kap survey oil salt sugar health previous study study several strength first involved several round group discussion expert consultation developing questionnaire second comprehensive questionnaire composed several aspect knowledge part source knowledge relationship oil salt sugar health recommended intake identifying unhealthy food high fat salt sugar attitude practice item based knowledge item however limitation related study design limitation study include small sample size many argue sample size needed questionnaire development validation however sample size study considered sufficient fulfilled criterion perform appropriate statistical test questionnaire validation additionally self-reported questionnaire primary source collecting information canteen staff quality data delivered study participant arguable study questionnaire applied ass kap related using oil salt sugar among canteen staff area china however questionnaire applicability among canteen staff outside china requires examination participant chinese numerous item developed according chinese guideline resource thus additional test validation modification necessary confirm applicability beyond china conclusion new validated questionnaire developed determining kap oil salt sugar among canteen staff shown adequate validity reliability thus valid questionnaire ass knowledge attitude practice level among canteen staff china oil salt sugar
