introduction december outbreak novel coronavirus disease covid‑19 also known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 reported first time life-threatening infection caused recently originating zoonotic virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 covid-19 highly contagious viral infection continued spread aggressively worldwide despite preventive lockdown measure clinical outcome ranged asymptomatic mild moderate symptom critical complication death case twenty percent covid-19 patient must hospitalized approximately 20–30 in-hospital covid-19 patient need intensive care unit icu care pooled case fatality rate cfr in-hospitalized icu-admitted patient 9.0–17.0 0.001 95.6 37.0 24.0–51.0 0.001 97.8 respectively complex highly contagious virus made tremendous impact health people world caused significant number death particularly elderly pregnant woman infected case underlying comorbidities low immune function cardiopulmonary disease cancer infectious disease hypertension diabetes hence early identification patient risk mortality necessary mitigate burden healthcare system reduce death much possible predictive model accurately predicts poor outcome covid-19 patient could assist efficiently allocating limited medical resource improve quality health care eventually optimize patient management disease behavior course unpredictable made diagnosis high-risk patient poor prognosis challenging problem prediction made different computational statistical model used respond challenge since beginning covid-19 pandemic new non-invasive digital technology artificial intelligence introduced mortality prediction covid-19 patient problem machine learn past experience would adjust new input machine learning approach subfield complex flexible classification modeling leverage big datasets reveal significant hidden relationship pattern prediction clinical outcome covid-19 patient method accurate result conventional statistic model
