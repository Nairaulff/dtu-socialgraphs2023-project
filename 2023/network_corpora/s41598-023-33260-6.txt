introduction excessive anxiety depressive symptom may appear early preschool year also often case attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder adhd characterized age-inappropriate hyperactive-impulsivity inattention co-occurrence anxiety depression child adhd associated impairment found worsen prognosis adolescence compared one disorder present recent meta-analysis estimated prevalence rate young child year 8.5 anxiety disorder 1.1 depression 4.3 adhd child adhd anxiety disorder depression common estimate even preschool age one population study 4-year-olds reported respective odds anxiety

anxiety depressive symptom year teacher-reported anxiety symptom year also predicted anx/dep contribute significantly including parent-reported symptom symptom specific anxiety disorder year predicted

parent-reported symptom anxiety disorder depression year significantly contributed anx/dep year line result another population study analysed continuous symptom score age year however study using diagnostic category find depression predicted subsequent anxiety disorder depression together finding lends support previous review suggesting preschool anxiety depressive symptom diagnostic threshold may clinically relevant excluding risk overlooking young child risk disorder line hypothesis found parent-reported adhd symptom year significantly predicted anx/dep year contributed slightly multivariable analysis still clinician aware preschool adhd symptom increase risk anxiety depression year later another population study without oversampling adhd symptom continuous interview symptom score time point adhd symptom year found associated depressive symptom year slightly increased risk subsequent anxiety symptom incidence risk ratio 1.05 recent study found adhd symptom 3-year-olds predict higher level anxiety symptom later however unlike study used continuous symptom score time point sampled participant severe behavioural problem aggression present study also previously reported moderate diagnostic stability adhd year suggesting stability adhd symptom across time population-based sample may low detect strong association adhd subsequent anx/dep nearly one-third child met criterion adhd year also met criterion least one co-occurring anxiety disorder depression time point line previous work documenting high comorbidity rate among disorder given high co-occurrence rate included adhd year model course anxiety depression could different child adhd however adding adhd year substantially change odds ratio preschool anxiety depressive symptom predicting subsequent anx/dep result indicate condition may separate trajectory throughout preschool year consistent finding older child underline need clinician ass disorder independently even young child present study extended previous longitudinal preschool study including teacher report correlation parent-reported teacher-reported anxiety symptom year low 0.15 line previous finding yet teacher-reported anxiety symptom depressive adhd symptom predicted subsequent anx/dep suggesting asking preschool teacher anxiety symptom may useful identifying young child risk still multivariable model teacher-reported anxiety symptom year contribute anx/dep parent-reported symptom included line finding inclusion multiple source study examining comorbidity previously found challenging significant disagreement parent teacher informant bias informant rating difference child symptom various setting may contribute discrepancy report even school child previous study concluded child problem anxiety depression often remain largely hidden teacher therefore uncertainty teacher rating study expected differentiating normal behaviour symptom child young year may even difficult older child taken together finding indicate clinician may prioritize parent-report assessing preschooler anxiety depression among symptom separate anxiety disorder year symptom social phobia predicted anx/dep multivariable logistic regression model including depression adhd symptom symptom social phobia related temperamental trait behavioural inhibition characterized reticence new situation unfamiliar people object prospective study early childhood found temperamental trait strongly predicts subsequent social anxiety also predicts anxiety disorder strength limitation strength current study include population-based cohort design prospective follow-up use parent diagnostic interview inclusion teacher report year age study also several limitation worth noting study designed estimate risk preschool symptom detect causal effect anxiety depression selection bias due attrition previously described found difference responder non-responders sex distribution mean number symptom reported parent teacher year slight difference mean parent education indicating attrition year biased result considerably teacher report available subsample 3-year-olds reducing statistical power yet power sufficient detect teacher-reported anxiety symptom year contributed significantly subsequent anxiety disorder depression univariable analysis used continuous symptom count reporting additional symptom year anx/dep absolute risk however child generally met diagnostic criterion anxiety disorder depression year age year parent questionnaire rating symptom equivalent diagnosis would entail broader assessment child symptom anx/dep reported teacher year adding risk shared method variance reporter bias e.g. anxious depressed mother may report symptom child information parent however common measure anxiety depression schoolchildren teacher frequently overlook child symptom perhaps child often well behaved outcome included anxiety disorder depression two group sufficiently large divide furthermore presented table child depression meet criterion co-occurrent anxiety disorder include specific phobia outcome using algorithm csi manual gave high occurrence rate specific phobia year 29.5 measure number specific phobia one specific phobia shown important child specific phobia significantly lower overall anxiety depressive symptom score year child anxiety disorder year participant study oversampled elevated symptom adhd year might excluded quiet introverted preschooler perhaps prone anxiety depression yet investigating course anxiety depression preschooler high activity level important given high co-occurrence rate anxiety disorder adhd depression adhd throughout childhood finally although risk overfitting logistic regression model present sample optimism-corrected c-statistics 0.78–0.81 suggest model considered reasonable strong conclusion future direction finding study suggest detect preschooler risk school-age anxiety disorder depression clinician ask parent anxiety depressive symptom ask teacher anxiety symptom child without co-occurrent adhd symptom aware anxiety depressive symptom easily overlooked young child also complexity increase disorder co-occur adhd therefore use standardized measure questionnaire diagnostic interview recommended result assessment central tailoring individual treatment whether adhd-focused parent-training program line nice adhd guideline age-adapted form cognitive behavioral therapy anxiety depression also prevention effort parent intervention programme promising preschooler symptom anxiety disorder future study aim identify shared risk factor contributing high co-occurrence rate anxiety disorder depression adhd preschooler anxiety depressive symptom develop subsequent disorder important identify moderating
