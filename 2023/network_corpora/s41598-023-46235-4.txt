depression anxiety involving participant cumulative evidence meta-analysis suggests psychosocial behavioral intervention covid-19 pandemic associated significant reduction depressive anxiety symptom especially covid-19 survivor general population exercise cbt two type psychosocial behavioral treatment found benefit psychological wellbeing knowledge first study systematically identify analyze effect psychosocial behavioral intervention depressive anxiety symptom various population covid-19 pandemic review summarized five type psychosocial behavioral intervention exercise cbt yielded significant moderate-to-large improvement depressive anxiety symptom consistent finding previous study systematic review meta-analysis rcts rebar revealed physical activity small-to-medium effect size depression anxiety non-clinical population addition weitz colleague found cbt also moderate effect size depression anxiety symptom finding demonstrated exercise similar effect cbt depression anxiety strengthened role exercise improving psychological well-being suggested two well-established intervention considered clinical practice manage depressive anxiety symptom related public health pandemic line finding existing neurophysiological evidence indicated underlying mechanism exercise cbt improving depression anxiety level act positive neurobiology neuroimmunology effect hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal hpa axis cortical-limbic pathway taken together available literature confirms exercise cbt beneficial effect could promoted preventive rehabilitative strategy improve emotional-related symptom pandemic nevertheless previous review shown three type intervention mindfulness-based intervention psychoeducation multiple intervention also elicit significantly positive effect psychiatric distress although finding current study support earlier finding however important note number available study subgroup meta-analysis small may achieve sufficient power detect relatively subtle subgroup difference despite individual study reporting significant effect three type intervention found subgroup analysis show significant improvement depression anxiety older people outbreak covid-19 pinquart colleague conducted meta-analysis found psychosocial behavioral intervention significantly large effect improving depressive anxiety symptom older person contrast previous finding result showed older person depressive anxiety symptom benefit psychosocial behavioral intervention one possible explanation healthy older population generally tends higher resilience emotional regulation compared younger population recent case report vahia support assumption mental health healthy older person negatively affected covid-19 moreover older population higher risk severe covid-19 illness may better control measure mitigate infection would likely lead reduced level depression anxiety due sense safety however result interpreted caution four study older people included meta-analysis limited number study potentially lead decreased statistical power evaluate beneficial effect addition subgroup analysis indicated psychosocial behavioral intervention showed significant improvement depressive symptom china study conducted multiple region meanwhile significant improvement anxiety found china west asia however noted small number included rcts conducted different region especially western country limited statistical power detect treatment effect result may readily generalizable reader take careful consideration limitation reading result study another notable finding psychosocial behavioral intervention delivered face-to-face traditional approach delivered using internet-based approach achieved significant effect depression anxiety although former approach superior effect face-to-face format large significant effect depression anxiety whereas online intervention small-to-moderate effect however several study showed two treatment mode produced equivalent effect treating psychological distress although emphasized face-to-face modality probably crucial producing large therapeutic effect indicated previous literature review johansson andersson discussed potential factor could affect treatment effect internet-based psychosocial behavioral intervention degree support provided role targeted group result entirely consistent previous evidence partially due lack factor associated effect different intervention delivery mode future research investigate association possible mediator effect internet-based face-to-face delivery mode draw firm conclusion whether equally effective addition beneficial effect availability accessibility cost-effectiveness approach improving public mental health covid-19 pandemic need assessed future treatment strategy help contain disease nearly psychiatric service conducted infection control strategy prevent possibility hospital-acquired infection instance reducing outpatient appointment placing greater constraint admission inpatient psychiatric unit may make challenging access medication receive in-person treatment particularly people great need psychological support unfortunately extra demand mental health service also made extremely difficult meet need pandemic even start covid-19 outbreak depression anxiety major contributor global health burden thus online delivery psychosocial behavioral intervention could feasible promising approach reducing depression anxiety general population individualized tailored therapy also considered different population group according need also found significant gender intervention type interaction effect female benefitted mindfulness-based intervention cbt exercise result also echo finding reported previous study showed gender-based divergent effect psychosocial behavioral intervention anxiety mcrae suggested gender-based physiological difference key factor strongly associated gender-based divergent effect intervention anxiety widely reported female male different response negative emotion johnson whisman reported female tended internalize psychiatric distress ruminating engaging self-critical behavior whereas male tended externalize distracting engaging environment argument supported neuroimaging finding showed negative emotion induced working memory task led activation emotion-related region amygdala orbitofrontal cortex female whereas region associated cognitive control prefrontal superior parietal region remained activated male result also agreed finding mindfulness intervention effective female reducing negative emotional tendency whereas cbt physical exercise effective male providing better external coping strategy knowledge pioneering study first show gender-based difference psychosocial behavioral intervention covid-19 pandemic result highlight importance gender-specific individualized intervention improve psychological wellbeing public health crisis psychosocial behavioral intervention shown significant improvement depression anxiety covid-19 outbreak however several limitation hindered implementation intervention general population first existing evidence psychosocial behavioral intervention focused patient psychiatric disorder chronic disease comorbidities covid-19 pandemic depressive anxiety symptom appeared widely general public given covid-19 spread worldwide including low- middle-income country significant disparity access mental health service important ensure evidence-based intervention employed effectively maximize benefit already overstretched resource finding suggested psychosocial behavioral intervention demonstrated beneficial effect general population particularly younger people well covid-19 survivor furthermore found obvious difference traditional face-to-face internet-based approach delivery mode achieved significant improvement depression anxiety evidence strengthened potential psychosocial behavioral intervention depression anxiety induced public health crisis find significant improvement intervention older adult medical staff reported depression anxiety sub-group analysis may explained inefficient data included meta-analysis four study older people medical professional limited number study potentially lead decreased statistical power evaluate beneficial effect covid-19 first pandemic human history simultaneously impact global economy health disrupt multiple aspect life majority world population absence comprehensive global vaccination strategy effective biomedical therapy evolving virus expected periodic outbreak coming year furthermore increasing evidence suggests negative mental health impact caused covid-19 substantial long-lasting particularly among vulnerable population tackling growing mental health burden therefore urgent global challenge nevertheless also present historic opportunity country global agency cooperate multiple practical approach effectively address mental health issue due public health emergency pandemic present systematic review meta-analysis synthesizes available rcts reveal psychosocial behavioral intervention particularly exercise cbt beneficial public health crisis-related depression anxiety finding provide important implication promotion implementation effective program improve coping strategy mental wellbeing general population public health crisis limitation study
