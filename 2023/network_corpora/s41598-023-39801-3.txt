introduction coronavirus disease covid-19 infectious disease caused novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 first case covid-19 identified wuhan december subsequently virus spread rapidly worldwide prompting world health organization officially declare pandemic march brazil initial case officially reported february são paulo nevertheless evidence suggests virus circulating brazil much earlier retrospective study serum collected thousand patient state espírito santo indicating presence covid-19 antibody already mid-december however uncertain spread virus started covid-19 reached virtually brazilian municipality mid-august registered least one death covid-19 arrived largest metropolitan area brazilian southeast namely são paulo rio janeiro likely imported europe china subsequently disease rapidly disseminated air ground transportation interior region country initially affecting north northeast macroregions spreading midwest south north region fewest icu bed public healthcare system manaus already collapsed may foreshadowing country worst pandemic period extended late end pandemic progressed epicenter disease shifted repeatedly resulting overall description three major wave infection death brazil march january end brazil recorded 36.3 million confirmed case covid-19 accounting approximately global case alarmingly virus claimed thousand life brazil representing approximately covid-related death worldwide mortality figure undeniably disproportionate toll given brazil comprised world population pandemic far-reaching consequence manifesting dramatic reduction life expectancy among newborn older citizen particularly northern part country city brazil played noteworthy role managing covid crisis following supreme court decision centralization decision-making federal government late march decentralization motivated vast geographic extension country nonconcurrent pattern spread also political issue hindered
