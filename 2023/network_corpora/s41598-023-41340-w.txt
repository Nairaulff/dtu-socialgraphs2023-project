introduction hong kong rank first world term number skyscraper least completed skyscraper height skyscraper well high-rise building number tall building modern city inevitably increase given global population rise increased urbanisation injection intraocular gas integral part many vitreoretinal surgery patient advised avoid air travel low cabin pressure high altitude cause expansion intraocular gas induce dangerous elevation intraocular pressure well-established evidence air travel post-vitrectomised patient gas insertion however evidence effect acute ascent elevator tall building intraocular pressure post-vitrectomised eye gas tamponade still lacking aim study evaluate whether travelling elevator significant effect intraocular pressure hence whether travelling modern elevator high-rise building avoided immediate postoperative period patient intraocular gas in-situ method prospective case–control study conducted according tenet declaration helsinki study protocol approved

elevator table table mean intraocular pressure change different altitude patient group without gas insertion group respectively full size table discussion currently lack evidence advise travelling tall skyscraper post-vitrectomised patient gas insertion immediate post-operative period locality many metropolitan city patient live high-rise building postoperative period would normally travel elevator reach home atmospheric pressure decrease ascent altitude intraocular gas bubble undergo expansion following boyle law indicates pressure system indicates volume gas eye several compensatory mechanism including limited choroidal flattening scleral expansion increased aqueous outflow mechanism limited ability accommodate expansion intraocular gas bubble globe maximum capacity reached intraocular pressure increase may result acute glaucoma even central retinal artery occlusion study hypobaric chamber used simulate air travel rise intraocular pressure seen average mmhg peak mmhg foot patient small intraocular gas bubble scleral buckling surgery hand patient complete intraocular gas fill par plana vitrectomy travelled land mountain peak ascent mean rate ft/min adverse consequence patient retinal vascular occlusion acute elevation intraocular pressure symptomatic visual field loss attributable elevated intraocular pressure foulsham presented case report post-vitrectomy patient month procedure experienced substantial increase intraocular pressure mmhg increase occurred 14-min helicopter ascent patient eye containing fill gas although significant adverse effect reported slow ascent rate partially filled gas may also result marked increase intraocular pressure study highlight importance rate ascent change intraocular pressure human eye result well-known post-vitrectomy patient gas insertion avoid air travel pilot study provides insight change intraocular pressure rapid ascent elevator study utilized tono-pen avia reichert usa measure intraocular pressure due portability independence gravity minimal influence corneal thickness tono-pen shown good correlation goldmann applanation tonometer within certain range intraocular pressure mmhg study osman al. margin intraocular pressure measurement normal patient group reported 3.8 mmhg tono-pen 2.7 mmhg goldmann applanation tonometer aimed investigate difference intraocular pressure elevator travel eye patient using operator thus minimizing effect measurement error noted tono-pen may underestimate intraocular pressure 4.5 mmhg actual intraocular pressure mmhg air-filled eye even higher intraocular pressure therefore plausible speculate actual difference intraocular pressure observed study could even significant study limited number floor hospital possible extrapolate result higher floor since atmospheric pressure decrease exponentially altitude despite limitation statistically significant change intraocular pressure found two study group hong kong residential building least story reach 60–70 floor intraocular pressure change patient living upper floor likely clinically significant study also standardized different surgeon port size percentage gas fill suturing sclerotomy wound despite limitation patient group good wound sealing without leakage post-operative day standardized study needed test larger range ascent higher altitude establish guideline high fast patient ascend elevator vitreoretinal surgery future work could explore use mathematical modeling simulate intraocular pressure change different altitude supplementary table conclusion finding study indicate statistically significant elevation intraocular pressure among post-vitrectomy patient gas insertion elevator travel even traveling modest number floor urbanization population growth continue pilot study provides valuable insight highlight need investigation potential safety implication elevated intraocular pressure individual residing city abundant tall building skyscraper
