introduction egg-mediated maternal effect mother influence size composition egg shape offspring phenotype effect taxonomically widespread insect bird fish amphibian reptile maternal effect occur instance adjustment egg mass often considered proxy amount nutrient present egg lipid protein e.g. fish egg adding hormone antioxidant carotenoid vitamin shown bird egg egg-mediated maternal effect adaptive offspring mother adaptive offspring maternal effect provide information enabling offspring adjust phenotype predicted condition encountered birth enhances maternal reproductive success maternal offspring fitness optimum aligned may also adaptive mother cost offspring fitness allow mother reduce investment per single offspring either offspring current brood higher survival

egg quality example egg mass typically correlate positively offspring size birth rev larger offspring often better survival prospect mobile likely survive earliest life stage main predator gape-size
