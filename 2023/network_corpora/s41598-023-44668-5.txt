introduction alcohol one main risk factor non-communicable disease injury health condition causally impacted world health organization european region 10.1 death attributable alcohol use alcohol-attributable fraction aaf highest european region compared region aafs especially high central eastern europe baltic country however alcohol-attributable death all-cause mortality could reduced life expectancy increased implementation effective alcohol control policy three policy highlighted especially effective cost-effective easy implement labelled best-buys measure include increasing tax alcoholic beverage enacting enforcing ban comprehensive restriction exposure alcohol advertising across multiple type medium enacting enforcing restriction physical availability alcoholic beverage example via reduced hour sale recent evidence corroborated recommendation however even though alcohol tax policy proven effective tool reducing alcohol harm strong evidence demonstrating benefit alcohol control fiscal policy generally under-implemented european region evaluating effectiveness alcohol control policy important consider influence factor related alcohol consumption change alcohol affordability due economic situation inflation purchasing power growth salary gross domestic product gdp example economic crisis started may impact population alcohol consumption due decline income three baltic country implemented different level alcohol availability affordability marketing restriction past year meanwhile poland established taxation increase even loosened control via decrease alcohol excise taxation effect evaluated alcohol control policy increased excise taxation implemented lithuania however single evaluation alcohol control policy subject potential confounding event condition may happened point time thus need introduce much control possible analysing several intervention different country region allows control aid determining general

acute alcohol consumption although woman shorter time period initiation regular alcohol use problem use compared men gap need receipt treatment larger woman men european region consumption pure

alcohol-related disorder cause clearly related alcohol consumption therefore alcohol control policy expected impact change woman mortality related alcohol consumption mortality external cause death therefore alcohol control policy influence result due alcohol control policy implemented lithuania men age-standardized mortality decrease higher compared woman contrary increase alcohol consumption poland found feasible cause slow halted increase life expectancy would like point potential limitation all-cause mortality could affected various factor difficult identify control prevention program health care funding economic crisis policy coronavirus pandemic etc. factor controlled study therefore ass association policy mortality indicator specifically imply causality however order give alternative explanation result factor must occurred exactly month alcohol control policy least instance unlikely controlled interaction country policy control three-way interaction i.e. time country policy also relied assessment implementation taxation increase reduced affordability availability restriction similar effect size assumption based expert judgement therefore different policy different number policy included analysis could impact cross-country comparison finally modelled effect alcohol control policy last one year effect policy clearly diminish due factor inflation increase disposable income taxation adaptation consumer availability restriction e.g. 1-year assumption likely underestimate however sensitivity analysis longer lasting effect showed different effect country effect significant lithuania estonia hypothesis economic crisis affected baltic country slightly different time see contributed reduction affordability alcoholic beverage associated reduction alcohol per caput consumption however within economic crisis crisis situation may also increase heavier drinker despite overall volume alcohol going economic crisis affected funding health system decreasing public expenditure health care may affected health indicator life expectancy all-cause mortality etc public health particularly affected country highest recession important mention uniqueness study evaluates impact immediately acting best buy alcohol control policy implemented estonia latvia lithuania broad measure all-cause mortality without distinguishing policy country poland included analysis control country alcohol control policy met priori defined criterion implemented outside range data available analysis since included instance policy change still found impact all-cause mortality indicates best buy policy taxation increase availability restriction still valid used often decrease all-cause mortality study demonstrated alcohol control policy associated reduction all-cause mortality among men baltic country all-cause mortality among woman also decreased significantly
