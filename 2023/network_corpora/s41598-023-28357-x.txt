introduction dental caries one common disease modern society prevalence reach world population despite considerable effort dentist health professional reduce incidence caries prevalence decreased last thirty year reason increasing focus prevention tooth decay includes dietary correction personal oral hygiene use prebiotics probiotic also use substance fluoride calcium phosphopeptide—amorphous calcium phosphate cpp-acp milk-derived protein gaining popularity day substance applied professionally used patient cpp-acp delivers bioavailable calcium phosphate ion act reservoir ion acid release calcium phosphate ion saturate saliva deposit calcium phosphate compound exposed surface tooth cpp-acp thought contribute deeper ion penetration thus remineralize superficial enamel layer also deeper layer hard tissue tooth may also improve aesthetic appearance complex antimicrobial property part bounding dental pellicle inhibits adhesion streptococcus mutant highly cariogenic bacteria tooth surface common knowledge fluoride therapy reduces enamel demineralization increase resistance organic acid fluoride facilitating effect diffusion calcium phosphate ion demineralized surface thus restore crystalline enamel structure composed fluorinated hydroxyapatites fluorapatite resistant acid primary crystal worth noting dental occlusal anomaly also common today prevalence varies 29.2
