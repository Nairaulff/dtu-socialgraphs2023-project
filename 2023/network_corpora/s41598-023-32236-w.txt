human one key issue surrounding implementation technology pertains potential impact job market system becoming increasingly capable performing task solely within purview human concern raised potential

subjective rating creativity revealing semantic distance score raters explicitly asked give low score common illogical trial human received max rating lower never received low rating suggests instead generating new idea human overrepresented producing common low-quality response based controlled-attention theory creativity seems weakness human creative thinking compared chatbots lie executive function several way human executive function may failed example human may difficulty maintaining task goal working memory failure inhibiting activation close concept switching attention distantly related concept addition contribution motivational affective factor human performance ruled may assume chatbots executed task always best capability computational point view however overall superiority solely explained low executive performance human superiority still evident even lowest performing human considered see additional analysis supplementary material associative theory creativity individual differ structure semantic memory creativity linked flexible highly connected semantic network exactly clear semantic network represented memory current chatbots speed accessing large data structure whether flexible may explain higher-level average performance compared average human performance however semantic distance score chatbots best response always systematically larger best human thus highly creative individual likely posse flexible semantic network still compete activating distant weakly related concept one question arises result chatgpt4 newest efficient chatbot currently available performed well according human raters compared human chatbots according openai chatgpt4 process eight time word chatgpt3 however chatgpt4 better chatbots measured objective semantic distance suggests access remote concept alone may explain chatgpt4 response evaluated creative perhaps explanation lie nuanced surprising way concept combined chatgpt4 example one session

limitation study restricted number observation chatbot limited statistical power especially comparison individual chatbots additionally control confounding effect fluency elaboration ask chatbots produce specific amount response limit word count response even though capable generating several idea within second purposely impaired potential comparing human chatbot creativity process level seems impossible chatbots black box know precisely generate response information access remains possible simply retrieve idea exist database case performance would merely reflect semantic retrieval
