introduction unravelling process influence plant assemblage along environmental gradient key understanding pattern plant diversity along gradient accordingly stress-dominance hypothesis sdh proposes competition primary force structuring plant assemblage stressful end gradient environmental stress increase doe relative importance abiotic filter shift expected lead change pattern trait divergence one trait convergence although study support prediction sdh others lack consistent support sdh partly explained process facilitation exclusion weaker competitor microenvironmental heterogeneity also structure plant assemblage along environmental gradient prevalence process scale-dependent importance different assembly process change across different scale pattern trait convergence divergence change along environmental gradient however simple trend increasing decreasing functional divergence obvious indicator underlying assembly process structure plant assemblage example widespread expectation sdh trait convergence occur stressful abiotic condition whereas trait divergence prevalent stressful environment however competition also lead trait convergence via weaker-competitor exclusion hierarchical competition alternatively stress gradient hypothesis sgh predicts facilitation competition vary inversely along environmental gradient facilitation becoming common increasing abiotic stress ameliorates micro-environmental condition stress-tolerant specie consequently facilitation increase functional diversity plant assemblage result high trait divergence furthermore study suggest effect facilitation decrease environment becomes highly stressful leading competition dominant driver plant assemblage end gradient therefore better understand process shape plant community pattern functional diversity combined pattern spatial association context non-random pattern specie association segregation typically associated competition aggregation associated facilitation however various factor contribute spatial pattern example specie may segregate due either competition environmental heterogeneity different specie varying abiotic tolerance occupy distinct microenvironments within community conversely aggregation may result facilitation seed trapping dispersal limitation environmental heterogeneity plant specie tend cluster together favorable habitat segregation also arise difference specie dispersal ability resulting trade-off colonization competitive ability several assembly process result trait convergence divergence specie aggregation segregation along environmental gradient however relative importance process varies depending spatial scale consideration accordingly competition facilitation change along environmental gradient small i.e. neighborhood spatial scale abiotic filtering tends drive trait convergence larger i.e. patch spatial scale conversely environmental heterogeneity lead either trait convergence divergence additionally larger spatial scale difference dispersal competitive ability plant also shape plant assemblage via colonization-competition trade-off drive pattern trait divergence therefore crucial examine assembly
