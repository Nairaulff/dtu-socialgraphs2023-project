introduction paediatric population medial epicondyle fracture account 11–20 humerus fracture occurring age four time common among boy girl 30–60 case fracture associated elbow dislocation medial epicondyle site attachment various muscle including radial ulnar flexor wrist superficial flexor finger palmaris longus pronator teres muscle although injury occur directly leading multi-fragment fracture commonly indirect case often result elbow deformation leading avulsion fracture medial epicondyle sudden hyperextension causing dislocation elbow diagnosis based primarily physical examination combined radiological examination lateral projection x-ray image used determine degree direction fracture displacement according watson-jones classification well degree displacement nature
