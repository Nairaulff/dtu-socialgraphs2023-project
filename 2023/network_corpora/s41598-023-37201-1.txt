introduction stroke major leading cause disability world-wide afflicting 795,000 people united state america every year southeastern region usa including north florida often referred stroke belt due 20–32 higher prevalence stroke national average individual regain ability walk safe predictable environment home within month post-stroke however many report dissatisfaction level community ambulation outside home environment stroke survivor frequently perceive community ambulation challenging report reduced balance confidence accomplishing common yet complex task negotiating uneven terrain walking unpredictable crowded environment perceived challenge walking broad term encompasses fear falling balance confidence anxiety specifically pertaining walking-related activity prevalence increased perceived challenge walking varies first six month four year post-stroke fact increased perceived challenge walking trigger fear-avoidance cycle leading diminished self-reported community ambulation total daily walking activity community participation limitation beyond simply secondary post-stroke physical impairment thus addressing perceived challenge walking vital improving community ambulation essential yet unmet goal stroke survivor conventionally construct perceived challenge walking measured self-report questionnaire ass one confidence perform daily activity without falling example modified falls-efficacy questionnaire activities-specific balance confidence abc scale evaluate balance confidence standing- walking-related activity around one home/yard community environment standardized questionnaire validated easy administer inexpensive time efficient subjective measurement perceived challenge come bias over-reporting positive trait under-reporting negative trait choosing extreme score moreover since self-reported balance confidence solely based one interpretation ability perform complex task doe always align physiological stress walking challenging situation since perceived challenge strong impact community ambulation assessment need coupled objective measure based physiologic response may may consciously perceived individual quantification sympathetic nervous system activity activated physically cognitively challenging stressful situation eliciting fight flight response causing increase eccrine sweat gland activity elevated cardiopulmonary response

indoor walking stroke survivor demonstrated increased response challenging outdoor task like walking ramp negotiating curb walking grassy terrain higher activity complex walking task also associated worse task performance quantified slower walking speed thus activity reflects conscious unconscious aspect perceived challenge fear falling well anticipation possible negative consequence e.g. fall
