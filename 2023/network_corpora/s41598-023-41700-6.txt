innovation capability know science technology innovation environment basis innovative activity creating good innovation environment first step improve capability green technology innovation support local government scientific technological innovation effectively promote enthusiasm green technology research development guide implementation green innovation activity improve ability green innovation therefore policy maker strive create favorable environment green innovation example government continuously optimize construction innovation infrastructure structure fiscal science spending attract market force participate green technology innovation activity environmental regulation second important factor fact scholar extensively explored effect environmental regulation effectiveness green development urban industry etc. generally found environmental regulation impact short-term inhibition long-term promotion study shown excessive growth environmental regulation level inhibit green innovation necessary properly control level environmental regulation different type environmental regulation may different impact green technology innovation therefore government formulate reasonable environmental regulation standard government subsidy also important factor development innovation activity requires large amount capital investment general scholar believe degree government support enterprise innovation activity make lack investment enterprise green technology innovation positive effect enterprise green technology innovation therefore government consider increasing research subsidy improve green technology innovation capability foreign investment intensify local market competition certain incentive effect industrial enterprise forcing local enterprise increase research development investment improve level technology economic development level urbanization also important factor affecting ability green technology innovation generally speaking higher level regional economic development greater protection environment urgent need green development high level urbanization often indicates developed level local economic development complete urban management system stronger attraction professional technical talent play positive role promoting local government enterprise carry green technology innovation activity improve green technology innovation capability study also note investment influential factor impacted many factor investment form expression technological level directly determines output result region rational use fund precise investment clear innovation type promote coordinated development economy environment improve ability green technology innovation therefore increasing investment impact factor improving environment generally speaking invested easier conduct innovative activity level technological capability higher moreover according value divide factor two group infrastructure level investment industrial structure air quality foreign investment gathered cause group essential focus factor factor divided effect group therefore policy maker pay attention factor improving level infrastructure increasing investment lay foundation improving green technology innovation capability paper provide suggestion improving green technology innovation capability according final result policymakers make policy refer important influential factor example helpful improving green technology innovation capability improve science technology innovation environment increase investment addition bipolar neutrosophic
