introduction according latest global cancer data cancer incidence mortality increasing rapidly estimated 2.3 million new cancer case chemotherapy considered effective method stop tumor progression however also substantial adverse event aes risk accurate timely reporting aes considered premise medical decision-making vital influence patient quality life therefore assessment routinely assessed clinical setting assessment subjective aes become structured recent year initially questionnaire focusing patient quality life used evaluate subjective adverse event currently many multifaceted adverse event monitoring system established facilitate reporting process direct reporting system patient adopted united state system directly incorporates patient self-reported data database analysis improving speed adverse event collection providing robust information physician national health service implemented patient-reported outcome measure prom ass patient outcome planned surgical intervention american research center developed symptom tracking reporting system star track report patient adverse event anderson symptom inventory mdasi developed anderson cancer center major scale used collect subjective symptom patient united state time however structured assessment still lacking country conventionally capturing aes responsibility physician nurse utilizing common terminology criterion adverse event ctcae recently study proven value incorporating patient self-reported data symptomatic assessment developed sensitive tool patient report aes moreover information symptomatic aes decision-making based report physician nurse rather direct report patient several study examined difference assessment physician patient however study investigated difference nurse physician important understand difference nurse physician different assessment may lead different symptom management strategy treatment decision present study investigated difference nurse physician regarding symptomatic assessment highlighted importance consistency medical team paper revealed given symptomatic aes assessment nurse physician differed nurse tended report aes physician consistency nurse patient higher nurse versus physician physician versus patient therefore study suggests precise collaborative approach needed ensure comprehensive care result general data april july breast cancer

study explored difference nurse physician regarding assessment symptomatic aes result showed given symptomatic aes assessment nurse physician differed reporting rate symptomatic aes nurse tended report aes physician 0.001 consistency nurse patient higher nurse versus physician physician versus patient physician tendency underreport subjective aes proven many study study found physician reporting neither sensitive specific detecting adverse event even tightly controlled clinical trial possible reason higher underreporting rate might tool used collecting patient data previous study collected patient data extracting information quality-of-life questionnaire data extraction conversion method may lead misunderstanding loss information therefore avoid information omission pro-ctcae used study facilitate intuitive sensitive self-assessment addition previous study found nurse physician patient different focus adverse event assessment physician tended focus adverse event caused chemotherapy nurse patient tended report symptom even likely caused disease rather treatment however believed difficult distinguish symptom solely caused treatment caused disease current study different educational background might reason higher consistency nurse patient american nurse association ana emphasizes nurse mastered assessment skill professional knowledge study shown nurse ability collect data patient perspective advocate right nurse view patient advocate patient safety take precedence interest contrast physician focus therapeutic effect treatment-related aes identify effective treatment approach true measuring aes caused treatment sufficient symptomatic aes important ignored mostly emotional expression patient cognition disease patient level satisfaction measured therapy evaluating improvement patient quality life perception health another alternative explanation higher consistency nurse patient could nurse better communication skill study found patient reluctant report aes since severe aes higher chance drug dosage adjustment turn may affect therapeutic effect present study underreporting rate among physician ranged 93.2 physician assessed patient aes based patient description therefore believe patient word may impact physician judgment real world physician usually ass patient aes medical visit last approximately min limited window insufficient patient fully convey issue present study patient aware symptomatic aes needed discus medical team possible bias may arise rate aes reported physician may much lower real world furthermore nurse unique position clinical setting monitor patient discomfort instance medication care part nurse daily work nurse need closely observe report reaction patient even likely due disease due antitumour treatment therefore nurse considered first health care professional work patient experience discomfort nurse also often first health care professional work research patient new intervention drug device kappa value decreased pair toxicity grade considered highest score nurse physician patient two two four respectively medical decision made serious aes grade higher reported study change medical decision due severe aes finding consistent study performed cirillo cirillo showed lack measurement patient quality life could lead medical staff underestimate adverse event another possible explanation grade difference could different assessment tool utilized ctcae specifies frequency aes occurred corresponding treatment measure taken according scoring level therefore aes meet ctcae criterion graded higher whereas pro-ctcae focus patient subjective perception health quality life however believe utilizing different assessment tool inevitable due different educational background medical team patient present study sensitive tool medical team patient utilized attempt reduce impact pro-ctcae developed content ctcae basis grade difference nurse physician compared significant difference nurse physician aes except fatigue may attributed different reporting rate nurse physician 73.7 vs. 24.0 moreover grade difference patient medical team revealed indispensable role patient nurse physician patient source symptomatic aes whereas decision-making still depends assessment nurse physician therefore collaborative approach needed ensure comprehensive care delivered study doe limitation first time recorded nurse physician assessed patient study designed stimulate clinical practice real world could result bias result future study evaluate effect time second result study represent relatively small sample size single centre consisting single disease-type patient relatively good performance status medical team enrolled four nurse three physician ass patient symptomatic aes therefore generalizability study limited multicentre study enrolled participant conducted confirm result study conclusion result study suggest difference nurse physician regarding symptomatic assessment point importance consistency medical team future study conducted explore best way integrate rating resource ensure consistency provide vital information required medical decision-making method material participant method single-centre questionnaire-based study conducted day chemotherapy ward breast centre hebei medical university fourth affiliated hospital april july breast cancer patient undergone chemotherapy enrolled study whereas patient illiterate hearing visual impairment excluded nurse physician good clinical practice gcp asked complete online training adverse event evaluation organized department clinical pharmacology hebei medical university fourth affiliated hospital within week study enrolled nurse physician completed course passed test assessment directly collect symptomatic adverse event patient developed questionnaire based pro-ctcae every questionnaire included six targeted aes patient needed self-report targeted symptomatic aes website system round chemotherapy
