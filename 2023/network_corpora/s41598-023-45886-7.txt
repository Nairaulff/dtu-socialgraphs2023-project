introduction gamification process service activity system transfigured promote similar motivational benefit found game application ranging education well-being gamification utilized strategy promote engagement improve user overall engagement level initial stage gamification independent research field begun around year ago research focused assessing whether gamification effectiveness following many work demonstrated mostly positive outcome well neutral negative outcome research matured exploring underlying gamification design strategy instance need adapting gamified system need individual user i.e tailored gamification seen significant rise influence interpersonal difference perception gamification previous research topic demonstrated demographic factor e.g age gender personality trait significantly alter user perceives gamification element nonetheless due lack dedicated theoretical model accurately describes interpersonal preference gamification application aforesaid factor might create effective tailored gamified system throughout year researcher worked certain characteristic may affect user using gamified system therefore people could grouped different profile according characteristic motivation player user typology used try simplify complexity user choice user typology one main factor influence user motivation personalized gamified environment hexad user model introduced marczewski shown empirically validated albeit partially created exclusively gamification hexad model based self-determination theory classifies human motivation intrinsic three basic human psychological need i.e. competence autonomy relatedness supported extrinsic reason something interest activity hexad user type derived intrinsic motivation achiever motivated mastery socialiser appreciating social interaction philanthropist motivated purpose free-spirits driven exploration player driven extrinsic reward one derived extrinsic motivation disruptors like trigger change user

indicated problem free spirit sub-scale indicated achieve better factor structure would necessary remove free spirit sub-scale assessing hexad user type adolescent would implicate simplification theoretical base model considering adolescent user however understand problem correlated age respondent since study tondello indicated item presented low factor loading suggested item would probably fit better another user type believe properly ass free spirit user type adolescent overall would necessary develop new item sub-scale regarding problem presented disruptor sub-scale lowest value understand possible explanation result item use latin expression status quo two study analyzed psychometric property scale adolescent sample explained respondent meaning survey application study replaced expression another expression validation language understand necessity reformulation item improve measurement user type however considering item disruptor sub-scale presented low factor loading study problem might user type since launching model several study presented negative result disruptors e.g. disruptors presenting negative result user type disruptors performing worse gamified application compared user type also study applied hexad scale considering different field indicated lowest score happen disruptor sub-scale e.g. understand result indication investigation user type necessary understand user type also learn people different age present characteristic nowadays brazil million inhabitant speak english fluently therefore essential short-term alternative provide suitable instrument brazilian portuguese considering field gamification hexad scale indicated instrument ass user type gamified system even though considered recent instrument already evaluated six different language i.e. english spanish turkish dutch german portuguese however evaluation concentrate analyzing scale considering adolescent therefore little known regarding scale effectiveness certain population overall result indicated brazilian portuguese version hexad scale useful assessing user type adolescent however considering problem disruptor sub-scale understand user type properly assessed using current version therefore study corroborates prior research indicating specific version hexad scale might necessary fully ass hexad user type adolescent use evaluated scale important advance future research involving population also development gamified environment industry therefore evaluation presented study may benefit several future study adolescent brazil limitation opportunity future study study limitation considering following aspect sample age participant data one portuguese-speaking country regarding sample dataset one unique school therefore result presented might analyzing diverse sample moreover dataset provided author without possibility collecting information participant prevented analyzing bigger sample indicating possible correlation user type demographic characteristic considering dataset provided differently first study able analyze whether instrument could used regardless gender therefore evidence gender variable e.g. age educational level influence psychometric property brazilian version hexad scale adolescent also participant 13-16 year old therefore scale might applicable people younger year old considering sample analyzed prior study brazilian portuguese version hexad scale majority composed people older year evidence scale measure well user type people aged year finally version analyzed study translated scale brazilian portuguese however translation suitable instrument measure hexad user type country also portuguese official language e.g portugal angola mozambique based limitation study result possible study carried future even though brazilian portuguese version hexad scale analyzed two study two different sample scale yet analyzed child future study tackle challenge generating result could useful designer researcher development gamified setting study item reach expected factor loading value also item presented problem prior study brazilian adult sample believe future study propose new translation item new item measure disruptor free spirit sub-scales improvement seemed necessary better measurement hexad user type finally considering nine different country portuguese official language presenting language variance cultural difference future study adapt brazilian portuguese scale portuguese-speaking nation expanding use portuguese conclusion gamification recent research topic user model identify user might behave gamified system current challenge field even though instrument created evaluate user profile analyzed several widely spoken language moreover study considered specific age group e.g. adolescent analyzing instrument study investigated psychometric property hexad scale brazilian portuguese considering adolescent sample result demonstrated five six hexad user type well measured current version indicated item need improvement moreover result presented indication current version hexad scale appropriate adult sample teenager leading need updated version population future intend conduct new study scale using younger sample also adapt create new item user type presented low factor loading study study extends literature hexad scale time provides insight research agenda field filled new study considering sample different language appropriate scale measure hexad user type help designer industry creation personalization several type gamified system therefore current study represents research contribution field personalized gamified system adolescent
