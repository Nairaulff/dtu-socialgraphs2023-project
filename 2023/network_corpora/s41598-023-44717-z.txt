slower rate vaccine uptake common motivation vaccine uptake concern acquiring transmitting covid-19 concern vaccine side effect safety frequently reported reason vaccine hesitancy knowledge one first study longitudinally evaluate sars-cov-2 vaccine uptake among pwud vaccination rate observed among pwud percentage point lower observed among general population british columbia baseline vs. discrepancy decreased percentage point end study period vs. difference substantially smaller observed study us–mexico border region people inject drug pwid received least one dose covid-19 vaccine compared general population important note low prevalence vaccine uptake setting may attributed low vaccine availability vaccine hesitancy well lack targeted vaccine program occurred current study cross-sectional study conducted among pwud found rate vaccine uptake least two dos among pwid australia significantly lower prevalence rate australian state territory among general population given rate vaccine uptake study greater population pwud targeted vaccine program implemented dtes may effective promoting vaccine uptake reducing barrier sars-cov-2 vaccine access among pwud however trend interpreted caution impact intervention directly compared population also possible factor may facilitated vaccine uptake setting including strong history healthcare outreach downtown eastside community vancouver needle exchange program seek test treat campaign hiv prevention lower rate criminalization based legalization regulation cannabis use decriminalization personal drug possession may also reduced barrier experience stigma associated healthcare access among pwud thereby facilitated vaccine uptake difference healthcare access e.g. outreach financial barrier structural factor e.g. criminalization substance use substance use stigma associated vaccine hesitancy previous study may contribute variability vaccination uptake across jurisdiction among pwud healthcare access may contributed observation people living hiv likely received two sars-cov-2 vaccine dos people living hiv may increased contact health service hiv care could led increased access sars-cov-2 vaccine also important acknowledge emergence sars-cov-2 variant vaccine guideline may contributed trend vaccine uptake among study sample dtes vaccination strategy offered vaccine member community without restriction age health status contrast general population offered staggered dos different demographic based age vulnerability illness may explain increased rate vaccine uptake study sample visit one

series yet interval reduced month emergence omicron variant late november guideline change increased public health messaging supporting vaccination may explain sharp increase booster dose uptake observed study visit three november january four january march among sample general population british columbia existing evidence shown majority pwud willing receive sars-cov-2 vaccine suggesting low uptake many setting reflects individual- e.g. substance use mental health comorbidities structural-level barrier e.g. socioeconomic deprivation homelessness stigma rather vaccine hesitancy targeted low-barrier vaccine program study setting included drop-in vaccination event community setting e.g. park parking lot street corner near neighbourhood open drug market active outreach shelter single room occupancy hotel people experiencing homelessness service designed reduce structural barrier vaccine access transportation cost booking system well reduce experience stigma discrimination often experienced pwud traditional medical setting since governmental medical mistrust associated vaccine hesitancy among pwud drug user peer-led organization involved planning delivery multiple vaccination event promote trust among community member jurisdiction implemented sars-cov-2 vaccination program peer-based harm reduction drop-in outreach able achieve vaccine uptake rate among pwid similar equivalent observed general population including people lived/living experience substance use i.e. peer planning delivery healthcare service shown increase access improve patient outcome among pwud result conjunction finding support use similar strategy among member structurally-marginalized population promote up-to-date sars-cov-2 vaccination new variant emerge additional vaccine dos required curb coronavirus-related morbidity mortality success targeted vaccine outreach model may also applicable promote uptake seasonal vaccination pathogen influenza among structurally marginalized population exposure covid-19 disinformation via social medium linked vaccine hesitancy among general population pwud study extend finding showing accessing sars-cov-2 information via social medium significantly associated lower rate vaccine uptake least high-school education significantly associated increased vaccine uptake seeking health information social medium may limit access evidence-based information increase exposure covid-19 disinformation undermines vaccine uptake may particularly relevant young adult study younger participant likely report using social medium source vaccine information also likely report safety concern primary reason vaccine hesitancy although association use social medium education vaccine uptake observed existing study finding important describe given social structural barrier experienced people use drug instance population may limited access technological device required social medium activity e.g. smartphones due high rate material insecurity socioeconomic marginalization demonstrating association social medium exposure vaccine uptake would indicate important method communicating health medical information public health emergency even among population may limited access social medium platform addition association education vaccine uptake may differ among population different variation educational attainment among general population university education associated vaccine hesitancy whereas high school education year associated vaccine hesitancy present study finding may inform educational intervention tailored distinct population pwud found effectively promote vaccine uptake preference accessing alternative information source rather traditional medical advice among pwud may stem experience stigma discrimination among pwud clinical setting experience addition criminalization substance use found contribute medical governmental mistrust well limit engagement health harm reduction service also found three common reason vaccine hesitancy among study concern vaccine side effect concern vaccine safety government mistrust three reason also common reason vaccine hesitancy among general population low- middle- high-income country finding reinforce need establish effective method promoting evidence-based vaccine information accessible language format general population well among marginalized population pwud expert suggested vaccine information intervention delivered trusted source health information e.g. peer harm reduction staff outreach worker community-based organization promote acceptability confidence among pwud result support finding suggest need build collaborative trusting relationship pwud peer-based organization evidence-based vaccine information accessible people diverse educational background exposure disinformation via social medium limited limitation study limitation study variable collected self-report may introduced socially desirable reporting recall error however measuring substance use stigmatized behaviour among pwud shown provide valid reliable measurement since arys vidus access cohort random sample finding may generalizable pwud addition cohort participant engage regular contact study healthcare personnel result may display higher rate sars-cov-2 vaccination pwud residual confounding may influenced result since observational study participant 18.9 original study sample identifier provided sufficient link personal health number consequently vaccination status date vaccine administration available possible association observed may influenced missing data however non-linked participant show difference sex ethnicity education homelessness non-injection injection use use social medium make decision vaccination

decision sars-cov-2 vaccination since recall period suspected covid-19 infection covid-19 testing last month capture sars-cov-2 infection occurred full 6-month period prior start study period could led underestimation vaccine uptake since portion sample receive positive test eligible vaccination however may modest impact result small proportion sample reported receiving positive test baseline 7.2 moreover structural behavioural barrier testing healthcare setting acquiring home testing kit may led underestimate covid-19 prevalence study sample lastly using general population british columbia comparison vaccine uptake limited many important difference population pwud likely impact uptake sars-cov-2 vaccine however reason including information general population use direct comparison rather identify difference vaccination rate experienced pwud based structural behavioural barrier healthcare vaccine access even presence aggressive targeted vaccination program designed reduce barrier vaccine uptake public health implication summary found sars-cov-2 vaccine uptake among pwud lagged behind rate general population although disparity decreased percentage point study period suggests targeted vaccination effort among marginalized population study setting effective promoting vaccine uptake level closer observed general population also found using social medium source vaccination information associated lower rate sars-cov-2 vaccine uptake higher level education associated faster rate vaccine uptake finding conjunction evidence support benefit targeted vaccination effort well expansion informational campaign co-designed peer group community organization promote evidence-based vaccine information facilitate informed vaccine decision-making
