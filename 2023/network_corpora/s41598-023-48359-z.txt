introduction dental implant contributed better quality life worldwide since invention according american academy implant dentistry 2.5 million implant surgery performed one percent population missing teeth life expectancy increase dentist expect people receive dental implant however implant cause consistent immune reaction recognized external material resulting severe inflammation near implant particularly oral biofilms established implant inflammation accelerated biofilms facilitate immune reaction inflammatory peri-implant disease categorized peri-implant mucositis peri-implantitis peri-implant mucositis reversible inflammatory lesion peri-implant soft tissue peri-implantitis lesion affect supporting bone well mucosa peri-implant mucositis usually diagnosed clinical sign inflammation bleeding probing and/or suppuration severe peri-implantitis often requires invasive time-consuming reoperation therefore removing oral biofilms crucial preventing implant failure effective removal oral biofilms achieved regular visit dental clinic use diverse dental device time biofilms grow within normal oral condition regular cleaning oral biofilms essential toothbrush classical standard method biofilm removal directly remove biofilm however oral inflammation typically occurs teeth gingiva deep pocket area current bristle reach oral inflammation significantly
