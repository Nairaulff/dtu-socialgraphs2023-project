introduction referee sport without question tough job decision need made literally split second required make decision high accuracy top endure almost constant complaint two team refereed make decision quickly human brain rely various heuristic implicit bias get way judgement referees—like humans—are immune type bias prior work reported variety similar instance example baseball umpire exhibit gambler fallacy call pitch showing negative auto-correlation call consecutive ambiguous pitch umpire also exhibit higher error rate ball strike excluding full count favoring call would end bat result another cognitive shortcut namely impact aversion essentially bias towards nothing price wolfers using foul data nba season found average player get called foul officiated opposite-race crew compared officiated same-race crew study steered lot discussion league office pope price wolfers revisited question analyzed data two 3-year period one publication original study 2003–2006 one 2007–2010 found first period still significant racial bias calling foul bias longer present second period valuable finding since provides evidence knowledge implicit bias help reducing even eliminating recently mocan osborne-christenson using data nba last min report described later find bias regard incorrectly called foul significant in-group bias regard non-called foul referee bias also considered one of—if the—major reason home field advantage earlier study utilized handful game played without fan sanction imposed team result mixed many recent study utilized natural experiment setting provided covid-19 pandemic examine impact empty arena stadium home court advantage refereeing bias majority pointing negative impact reduced crowd home field advantage official bias towards home team referee might show bias towards home team also towards specific individual— star —players specific team regardless game played e.g. team top standing volume research type bias undoubtedly smaller study examined example barrett found player higher salary proxy star-quality player receive foul drawn call per min caudil found nba star awarded additional 0.32 free attempt per minute fourth quarter nba playoff game different sport findlay ste-marie found figure skater known judge received higher mark compared unknown athlete erikstad johansen analyzed penalty data norwegian league found successful team likely receive incorrect penalty compared opponent likely denied penalty awarded nevertheless contradicting study null result i.e. sign player team bias example morgulev find bias regard star player team nba bose examined presence status team bias german soccer top-league able identify tangential line research also looked underlying mechanism lead similar potential bias elaborate related literature last section also connect work finding method existing literature objective work examine possible implicit bias nba refereeing three different level home away team individual super star player team iii players/referee race use play-by-play data well data last two minute l2m report since season study l2m report include detailed break event took place last min close game defined game within point entry call whether call correct also information player/team benefited/disadvantaged call furthermore information missed call studying first two type implicit bias use l2m report estimate net whistle gain team player based situation benefited disadvantage empirically estimate statistical significance monte carlo simulation racial bias make use play-by-play data since l2m report information regard referee made call elaborate supplementary material even able overcome inconsistency two data source mainly regard game clock match l2m data play-by-play obtain information referee made call foul call total incorrect contrary incorrect non-calls come foul total approximately foul impossible know referee responsible call e.g. closest referee thus use play-by-play data similar previous study however unlike prior study relying foul call order properly analyze call one need consider player benefited call well piece information missing prior analysis one available foul call play-by-play data furthermore given small foul called incorrect could bias calculation call correct therefore needed made hence rely analyzing technical foul called referee also subjective compared foul call main finding summarized following whole period data cover overall home-team bias even pronounced playoff however bias almost eliminated since season specific player exhibit statistically significant positive net whistle gain however true opposite direction i.e. player statistically significant negative net whistle gain find evidence bias direction towards individual team racial bias observed analyzing personal technical foul called rest paper organized follows following section present detail data used analysis method next present discus result last section discus existing relevant literature connection study also conclude work discussing limitation future step method study used l2m report data covering season first season nba started releasing

disadvantaged side decision decision take possible value correct call incorrect call incorrect non-call inc correct non-call cnc inc decision well-defined cnc decision theory every second game violation cnc hence instance included report subjective criterion change year-to-year fact season 6.4 cnc entry per game season almost cnc entry per game mean analysis rely cnc data point since consistent across season also collect play-by-play data nba api data provide information event took place game including technical foul called consider personal technical foul filter call like defensive delay game etc. labeled technical foul well every technical foul play-by-play data also provide information referee calling course player receiving collected demographic referee manually i.e. going profile league webpage player used online database racial information player player database followed procedure referee visiting profile page league webpage home court examine possible home-court bias refereeing start calculating home team net whistle gain game l2m dataset net whistle gain home team consists two part namely whistle benefit whistle detriment whistle benefit number

correct call given treat type violation/call differently decision boundary different every type violation allows control simulation difficulty violation team involved figure precision recall overall different violation type last season full size image figure decision boundary simulation call full size image player team-specific examining presence player-specific implicit bias referee use method however given essentially perform multiple statistical tests—one player—i expect deem statistically significant result even chance therefore perform meta-test calculate probability data point came statistically significant false positive particular the—realistic case—assumption test correlated use binomial distribution meta-test test probability leading false positive result estimate probability observing least positive test due chance p=r array m\\ p\end array 1-\alpha m-p probability small one confidently concludes non-zero effect size observed false positive follow exactly approach examining team-specific bias racial bias last type implicit bias examine race instance affect bias/heuristic aforementioned rely technical foul called particular compare call rate technical foul player race referee making call call rate player different race diff requires computation number technical foul within across race also total minute referee court player different race order estimate statistical significant difference =\tau diff -\tau rely monte carlo simulation particular every referee estimate overall call rate per game technical foul iterate every game refereed perform two-step simulation first based referee call rate simulate binary decision whether referee called simulated technical foul game second technical foul simulated recipient randomly chosen among player took court game probability player receiving simulated technical foul proportional playing time game repeating process several time obtain empirical distribution null hypothesis racial bias controlling racial composition player referee various game table precision recall different type violation full size table result referee home court bias small since covid-19 pandemic start looking l2m data estimating net whistle gain home team whole period covered data table present result see overall statistically significant home court referee bias home team benefited approximately situation expected corresponds 1.2 percentage unit difference home visiting team furthermore see home court bias much higher playoff given home court referee bias part home court advantage hca linked home team fan wanted examine separately season during/after covid-19 pandemic nba finished season bubble fan started season empty arena fact team start fan limited capacity middle season reached arena fan closer capacity playoff see table home court referee bias appears small almost disappeared season fact agreement point-equivalent overall home court advantage estimated team regression rating particular based sagarin rating home court advantage 2.74 point dropped 1.75 point overall see presence home team referee bias however second time period analyzed bias lower magnitude remains seen whether artifact empty arena covid-19 pandemic example one possible mechanism least partially led diminished home court advantage second time period introduction coach challenge season coach contest one call per game trigger automatic review call change nfl introduced similar system win percentage home team dropped 58.5 however nfl coach challenge nba strictly another difference fact nba coach challenge made call e.g. foul called missed call e.g. foul called saw fig majority referee mistake originate non-calls rather call therefore impact expected overall smaller nevertheless several anecdote supporting possible impact home court advantage example first week new rule portland dallas large degree due coach challenge overturned foul called end game portland call overturn resulted percentage unit swing win probability favor portland according espns win probability model home court advantage appears particularly pronounced playoff table playoff better team according league standing regular season play general game home analysis includes game i.e. even game home team worse two mean major reason drive better whistle quality team fact one team play home court course many additional reason lead pronounced playoff home field advantage identifying cause beyond scope work example one plausible additional mechanism referee averse making erroneous call missing call lead closer team losing series thus getting disqualified playoff situation appear majority case home team lower seed hence might getting even beneficial whistle would get regular season game table home court bias reduced since season season covid-19 pandemic full size table player-specific bias positive team-specific bias next examine net whistle gain individual player season covered l2m data repeat process home court referee bias focusing individual player use analysis player involved least calls/missed call whole 8-year period corresponds top 10th percentile provides total player also estimating base call/miss rate violation type filter data specific player simulate table show result player see player exhibit statistically significant positive net whistle gain significance level using binomial metatest aforementioned approximately 7-in-1000 chance instance false positive therefore say quiet confidence specific player get better whistle expected also see player all-stars all-nba and/or all-defensive nba player e.g. dwyane wade chris paul carmelo anthony karl-anthony town jayson tatum andre drummond hassan whiteside patrick beverley also looked opposite direction i.e. whether player consistently get worse whistle expected total player exhibit statistically significant negative net whistle gain however probability instance false positive non-negligible equal turning team-specific analysis table depicts result see team positive net whistle gain team negative net whistle gain however probability case false positive non-negligible well overall say data support presence player-specific referee bias however one direction specific player benefiting expected furthermore composition group player exhibit positive net whistle gain point bias towards star player nevertheless given fact star player experience net benefit hard argue explicitly reason behind implicit bias observed finally strong evidence team-specific bias evidence racial bias observed among nba referee lastly examine presence racial bias refereeing decision given referee player data white african american focus two racial group analysis also filter game available information referee situation correspond 3.6 game dataset personal technical foul called 0.0204 technical foul per min called referee opposite race player referee called 0.0182 tech per min player race overall referee called 0.0022 technical foul per min player opposite race compared player race difference even statistically significant hard qualified racial bias since corresponds technical foul per game approximately furthermore estimated distribution tech call rate difference simulating technical foul described earlier figure present distribution vertical line corresponds actual tech call rate difference obtained real data simulation obtained value 0.0022\ case indicating even small difference observed statistically significant agreement latest study pope price wolfers providing additional evidence examination different violation call absence implicit racial bias nba referee figure difference personal technical foul call rate different referee-player race statistically different one expected random chance full size image table net whistle gain individual player full size table table net whistle gain different team full size table related work discussion mentioned introduction different line literature explored presence various type referee bias notably home court star player racial bias variety sport almost study use variable interest volume call function teams/players make implicit assumption violation call correct violation call missed true saw analysis l2m example study racial bias price pope wolfers foul called analyzed correctness call available hence included analysis similarly actual foul call missed possible included study one way overcome problem rely call highly subjective technical foul e.g. excessive complaining arguing referee player etc. another way solve problem identified use knowledge correctness call missed call study recruited expert help annotate correct/incorrect call non-calls inevitably small-scale due manual labor associated annotating game however l2m data allow larger scale analysis l2m data used analysis provide opportunity work mocan osborne-christenson one made use information nevertheless focus foul part violation committed game using technical foul data l2m report work expands prior literature identification quantification referee bias providing additional evidence presence lack different type bias examined summarize analyzed l2m play-by-play data nba analyze number different implicit bias referee might exhibit started looking home court bias found past year robust home court advantage decline last year however given period overlap covid-19 pandemic absence fan arena remains seen whether observation trend anomaly since various study shown absence fan related reduction home court/field advantage examined possibility player team-specific bias analysis indicates evidence presence bias driven player team positive direction i.e. specific player benefiting expected call non call finally examined presence racial bias referee decision using personal technical foul called proxy find evidence racial bias key part analysis simulation calls/violations recorded l2m data requires estimation call base rate violation type base rate might noisy little amount data available given type violation general problematic case expect affect result since violation type also appear simulation frequently nevertheless alternative use bayesian average decision boundary one tangential line research deal underlying mechanism mental model related decision making referee variety process proposed discussed literature instance compensation strategy lead referee making decision ambiguous situation considering previous call example soccer referee already awarded penalty kick team s/he possible ambiguous call team probable call penalty opposing team game management strategy also mechanism explain refereeing decision instance preventive refereeing approach lead referee applying rule strictly early game order build expectation player leeway application another type game management macmahon mildenhall provide example basketball referee calling obviously incorrect foul visiting team big lead order manage volatile home crowd case referee made choice favor game management since call deemed one would materially change outcome game however realistic scenario referee might change process officiating dynamically raab proposed dynamic threshold model every referee subjective threshold game management game reach threshold e.g. via overly aggressive play two team referee switch underlying decision process mechanism rule application game management vice versa focusing reasons/processes behind various referee bias bose explored three potential mechanism referee bias towards elite soccer club germany considered career concern e.g. concern unfavorable call high prestige club lead exit league rank social pressure well effect performance team adolescence year study find evidence three mechanism driver bias another interesting study morgulev analyzed data instance potential offensive foul israeli basketball league studied interaction referee decision making decision player attempt deceive referee order get favorable call author found evidence support use representativeness heuristic referee ass situation real offensive foul typically result defender falling referee may mind representative case likely call offensive foul defender doe fall work unlike study doe deal identifying underlying mechanism lead biased decision making finding could provide insight area similar implicit bias might appear example referee scientific work e.g. research grant research paper etc might also exhibit bias towards specific scientist thus policies/procedures put place avoid e.g. double blind review another example home court bias could potentially extend area like judicial trial research already shown type implicit bias judge familiar defense attorney i.e. attorney play home court literally may willing listen carefully attorney argument motion true randomization judge/courthouse assignment help exactly court court abroad claim however evidence assignment always fully random example huther kleiner analyzing bankruptcy filling found judge assignment predicted lending decision hedge fund overall sport provide controlled environment wealth data one use analyze quantify type implicit bias lesson learned useful many different setting
