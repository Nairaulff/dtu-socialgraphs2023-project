year ago initial settler lithuania migrated west lithuania along baltic sea individual originated hunter-gatherer population western europe3 formation first baltic coastal culture lithuania occurred interaction indigenous population indo-european late neolithic period archaeological linguistic genetic evidence indicates uncertain influence finno-ugric people balts proposed around 6000–5000 year ago middle neolithic period finno-ugric people migrated eastern coast baltic region late middle age eastern baltic region remained one isolated area europe roman empire fell fifth century eastern baltic region bypassed population movement migration period later first second world war 1922–1945 1940–1952 emigration exile also significant impact population lithuania lost thousand people i.e.
