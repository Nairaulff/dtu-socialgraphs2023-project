introduction resting metabolic rate rmr defined body energy expenditure rest person awake post-absorptive thermoneutral state exercised typically resting metabolic rate largest component total energy expenditure increasing great importance example reducing excess body fatness one way increase rmr increasing physical activity leading increased muscle mass resistance training also increase rmr recent year significant increase obesity obesity-related disease trend continue grow order treat obesity prevent seems necessary look method increase daily total energy expenditure promising direction research may use whole-body vibration wbv purpose wbv many positive metabolic effect used therapy various disease well sport include wbv effect improving blood circulation blood flow improving muscle strength bone density improving nervous system function reason wbv used treatment prevention many disease e.g covid-19 quality life osteoporosis chronic low back pain sarcopenia ataxia wbv also affect

food tef i.e energy cost chewing swallowing digesting absorbing storing food tef significant part energy expenditure influenced among thing caloric content diet eating habit physical activity sympathetic nervous system activity shown sympathetic stimulation upper gastrointestinal tract may increase metabolic rate 15.6 previous paper shown wbv effective method improving gastrointestinal function two week low-intensity wbv effective therapy reducing symptom severity patient chronic functional constipation reason vibrating capsule begun used patient constipation vibrating capsule may improve constipation augmenting physiological effect waking meal bowel movement circadian rhythm vibrating capsule promote defecation well ameliorating symptom improving quality life patient functional constipation sustained efficacy applied local abdominal vibration specific abdominal vibro-massage abdominal massage stimulate parasympathetic activity thus gastrointestinal response increase peristaltic movement accelerates passage food gastrointestinal tract participant declare constipation medical interview direction report functional change gastrointestinal tract intervention applied local vibration targeting abdominal cavity could significantly affect gastrointestinal tract function improve function thus affecting tef study used wbv combination local vibration although local vibration may affected tef observed metabolic effect may also due effect wbv combination local vibration wbv increased metabolism wbv may also result change circulation peripheral vascular system sensitive vibration stimulation previous study increase mean blood flow observed wbv whole-body vibration also increase muscle activity inducing tonic vibration reflex muscle rmr mostly dependent amount metabolically active tissue individual mainly muscle mass thus increasing muscle activity improving tissue blood flow also affect metabolic rate conclusion result study indicate week using wbv combination local vibration applied abdominal area resting metabolism increased significantly indicates type vibration addition obesity therapy wbv among beneficial metabolic effect increase rmr thus total energy expenditure strength limitation study strength study rigorous methodology research method used intervention lasted week time observed increase rmr men perhaps result would different different intervention period reported effect applies vibration described characteristic body position young healthy men without overweight obesity participated study study also conducted
