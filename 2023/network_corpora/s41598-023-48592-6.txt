introduction aquaculture play essential role providing food nutrition production aquaculture fishery reached million tonne value usd billion china sea cucumber apostichopus japonicus becoming popular recent year high medicinal nutritional value compared cultured specie increasing market demand greatly stimulate aquaculture japonicus annual production 222,707 metric ton china pond culture play leading role producing sea cucumber culture area pond example 425,522 hectare china improving production efficiency essential aquaculture seed mortality however greatly reduces production efficiency pond almost small seed sea cucumber wet weight died directly seeded pond dalian indicates body size important factor affecting survival seed pond culture large seed 2.5 wet weight commonly used pond culture better survival small seed wet weight kept hatchery month reaching appropriate size however large seed costly reach seeding net biomass compare small seed directly decrease economic benefit important know reason mortality seed accordingly establish effective method improve production efficiency sea cucumber pond culture substrate aquaculture pond mainly silt difficult sea cucumber crawl attach mud substrate sea cucumber seldom found muddy habitat field despite abundance organic matter therefore reasonable speculate sea cucumber probably get stuck mud may consequently lead death sea cucumber inevitably exposed stress e.g handling anoxia stress transported seed hatchery pond environmental stress adversely affect movement-related behavior sea cucumber example small japonicus exposed high-intensity handling stress showed decreased movement foraging behavior thus transport stress probably increase adverse effect movement-related behavior sea cucumber mud juvenile sea cucumber choose suitable habitat field better fitness well documented artificial reef e.g oyster shell tile greatly improve aggregation behavior sea cucumber therefore worth investigating whether directly seeding sea cucumber onto artificial reef reduces adverse effect purpose present study investigate behavioral response japonicus mud various condition may provide valuable information pond culture ask whether mud adversely affect movement-related behavior japonicus different body size whether transport stress increase adverse effect movement-related behavior mud whether adverse effect

discussion mud negatively affect movement-related behavior small japonicus improving survival seed crucial pond culture sea cucumber common practice large individual 2.5 seeded pond better survival despite greatly reducing harvested net biomass economic benefit significant difference number crawling cycle proportion individual reaching wall large seed whether exposed mud well documented movement capability strongly related survival sea cucumber sea urchin crawling behavior essential sea cucumber move suitable place feeding habitat wall experimental tank simulated nearby artificial reef pond culture present study result suggest mud doe negatively affect experimental behavior larger seed sea cucumber seeding small individual promising increase economic efficiency remains largely unknown mass mortality exists seeded pond study found wall-reaching behavior crawling behavior smaller japonicus exposed mud significantly poorer exposed adhesion substrate necessary sea cucumber carry movement-related behavior mud may sufficient surface area sea cucumber adhere consequently reduces crawling behavior result suggest mud greatly hamper effective movement small japonicus consequently prevents moving artificial reef even placed nearby found crawling distance number crawling cycle proportion individual reaching wall small seed significantly smaller large one exposed mud confirms body size important factor affecting movement-related behavior sea cucumber mud possible explanation small japonicus fully developed motor capability lead poor performance crawling wall-reaching behavior mud finding explain rationality seeding large japonicus pond transport stress increase adverse effect movement-related behavior japonicus mud sea cucumber seed commonly transported nursery pond culture indicates transport stress inevitable sea cucumber pond culture present study found proportion individual reaching wall significantly lower stressed large seed unstressed group significantly smaller number crawling cycle crawling distance consistently occurred stressed large seed unstressed group result clearly suggest transport stress greatly reduces ability move large seed mud alone doe show negative effect behavior large individual proportion duration individual failed struggle consistently increased large seed stressed suggests transport stress probably decrease movement-related behavior sea cucumber stressed small japonicus showed significantly poorer performance number crawling cycle crawling distance unstressed japonicus proportion duration individual

effective approach reducing adverse effect essential improve production efficiency sea cucumber pond culture found experimental behavior stressed japonicus seeded onto artificial reef significantly greater placed mud finding suggest artificial reef greatly improve movement-related behavior sea cucumber probably contribute survival pond culture artificial reef commonly used provide habitat promote food utilization sea cucumber pond culture seeding stressed sea cucumber onto artificial reef cost-effective method increase production efficiency pond culture interestingly struggling behavior crawling behavior unstressed small japonicus significantly improve seeded onto artificial reef indicates unstressed small japonicus likely crawl artificial reef get stuck mud conclusion significant difference number crawling cycle wall-reaching behavior large seed exposed mud compared exposed transport stress negatively affected movement-related behavior japonicus mud seeding
