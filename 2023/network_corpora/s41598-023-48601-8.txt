introduction advent covid-19 pandemic highly transmissible zoonotic infection caused sars-cov2 resulted global health crisis witnessed since spanish flu influenza pandemic consequence patient healthcare worker since clinical manifestation include wide spectrum sign symptom —ranging asymptomatic infection acute respiratory distress syndrome death—considerable effort devoted identifying subset patient highest risk disease progression hence patient covid-19 infection trigger broad dysregulation host response infection encompasses overproduction pro-inflammatory cytokine disruption coagulation pathway abnormal endothelial activation covid-19 patient overexpression interleukin il-6 interferon-γ tumor necrosis factor tnf profoundly affect iron metabolism erythropoiesis leading shortened erythrocyte lifespan segregation circulating iron macrophage bone marrow liver spleen shifting blood cell production towards myelopoiesis expense erythropoiesis finally leading anemia addition effect inflammation drop hemoglobin level may due also thrombotic microangiopathy caused direct viral-mediated endothelial injury endothelitis turn cause adamts-13 consumption activation intrinsic coagulation pathway microvascular hemolytic anemia pathway inflammation intravascular coagulopathy supported characteristic laboratory abnormality typically seen severe covid-19 patient hyperferritinemia leukocytopenia thrombocytopenia c-reactive protein il-6 d-dimer level seen lower respiratory tract infection anaemia common independently associated poor clinical outcome however even enter third year since advent pandemic evidence prevalence prognostic role anemia patient hospitalised covid-19 still conflicting controlled restricted number covariates mainly based monocentric

discussion study overall prevalence anaemia among patient admitted covid-19 high affecting one person two independently associated higher risk progression towards severe disease death even controlled range potential confounders also people anaemia affected underlying chronic condition likely present baseline biomarker profile suggestive profound activation inflammation pathway prevalence anaemia found study line one found cohort substantially higher one found meta-analysis including five study found pooled prevalence 25.6 study confirmed evidence anemia independent risk factor severe covid-19 observed cohort smaller population interestingly prevalence anemia admission similar one community-acquired adult child hospitalised non-covid community-acquired pneumonia thus suggesting finding may characteristic shared also lower-respiratory tract infection likewise association baseline presence anemia poor clinical outcome reported consistent study involving patient covid-19 non-covid related pneumonia study anemic patient likely present increased level c-reactive protein procalcitonin lactate dehydrogenase ferritin thus suggesting likely pathophysiological mechanism leading anemia inflammation also cohort found association presence anemia higher d-dimer baseline together association anemia lower platelet count admission point towards ruling thrombotic microangiopathy underlying cause anaemia covid-19 furthermore study anemic patient likely present lower peripheral oxygen saturation higher prevalence diabetes mellitus high blood pressure chronic kidney disease regard however—having controlling presence comorbidities clinical characteristic baseline inflammation markers—our study provides strong evidence anemia risk factor disease progression death rather surrogate worse baseline risk supported assumption patient affected pneumonia low haemoglobin level decrease total oxygen content blood time increase myocardial demand thus requiring higher cardiac output maintain adequate systemic oxygen delivery hence impaired capability cardiorespiratory system deliver sufficient oxygen peripheral organ need oxygen supplementation overall risk death substantially higher role anemia increasing risk death highlighted observation study hemoglobin level almost linearly associated inverse hazard in-hospital death extremely low level baseline hemoglobin associated approximately four-fold increased risk mortality study several strength including large sample size multicentric design accordance newcastle–ottawa risk bias assessment cohort study exposed non-exposed cohort drawn population outcome assessed using death certificate secured medical record population truly representative correlation outcome controlled wide range covariates also outcome assessed validated score hand acknowledge limitation first retrospective observational nature result may biased confounding factor could affected clinical progression included analysis second information presence pre-existing anemic condition hospitalisation third level haemoglobin assessed hospital admission report evolution hospitalization fourth study designed investigate pathological mechanism leading anemia covid-19 future study focus prevalence prognostic role anemia lower respiratory tract infection well providing evidence prevalence anaemia role guiding therapy long-term covid finally able use strength weakness opportunity threat swot analysis could better highlight strength limitation finding also term economic aspect conclusion conclusion study demonstrated anaemia highly prevalent patient hospitalized covid-19 baseline low haemoglobin level even controlling extensive number potential confounders strongly associated disease progression mortality view haemoglobin value along validated risk factor score closely monitored covid-19 patient requiring hospitalisation prioritise resource people high risk disease progression mortality high-quality evidence prevalence
