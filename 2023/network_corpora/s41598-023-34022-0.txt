agreement meta-analysis study revealed history previous vaginal delivery one important factor success vbac possible reason could due good psychological readiness awareness advantage vaginal delivery mother history vaginal delivery study also found strong association cervical dilatation four centimeter admission successful vbac evidence pakistan nigeria support current finding might obstetric care

also significantly associated successful vbac evidence meta-analysis study support present finding revealed younger woman especially year old likely successful safe vbac another study also reported maternal age year independently associated failed tolac may older mother likely attempt tolac due fear urine rupture furthermore found strong association low station admission successful vbac finding supported previous study reported woman station lower significantly associated successful vbac lastly history stillbirth significantly associated successful vbac evidence revealed history fetal complication adverse birth outcome previous pregnancy increased cesarean delivery rate previous history stillbirth labor could influence woman preference mode delivery obstetric care provider decision
