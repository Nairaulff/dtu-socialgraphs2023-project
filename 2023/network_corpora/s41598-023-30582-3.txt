comprehensive systematic review meta-analysis synthesized evidence study conducted usa germany focusing effectiveness intervention/health education health outcome eight eleven study conducted possible germany public health policy call promote community awareness emergency health condition ami stroke need call since public school level however atypical presentation ami remains important issue especially older adult woman prevent delayed diagnostics treatment moreover although morbidity mortality rate declining ami high-income country rising alarming pace low middle-income country therefore ami intervention older adult still needed mainly conducted low-middle income number participant group ranged 226,958 participant range relatively broad intervention conducted national community intervention national campaign however intervention focused individual level systematic review focused older adult study conducted among woman older adult woman area concern since significant group experiencing atypical presentation delay seeking treatment result high mortality rate meta-analysis found people received three intervention including receiving kit via home emergency medical

educational program addition low-intensity educational campaign involved donated advertising medium increase stroke awareness unsuccessful effectiveness using different pathway explored meta-analysis suggests providing people kit information emergency service effectively encourage seek help emergency however essential note effectiveness intervention may vary depending specific context population studied overall finding meta-analysis helpful healthcare professional emergency responder policymakers designing effective intervention promote prompt appropriate response emergency interestingly many intervention different pathway applied promote knowledge decision-making appropriate action time seek treatment however based meta-analysis odds calling taking aspirin improved result might intervention may suit general people fit older adult older adult specific characteristic regarding aging process socio-demographic status first aging process pathogenesis limit older adult skill perceiving information learning understanding compared younger adult aging process pathogenesis limit older adult vision hearing attention concentration ability remember information providing health education intervention group must adhere limitation older adult requirement older adult reduced memorization ability program designed practice enhance skill ability manage symptom independently moreover repetitive self-practice would enable practitioner learn effectively understand reason achieve sustainable learning teaching procedure period long stimulus transmitted five sens namely ear eye nose tongue skin produce learning outcome stimulus transmitted one sense practice helped turn abstract concrete better understanding second socio-demographic status older adult limitation regarding education condition obstacle accessing receiving understanding health information taking care include poor reading listening skill fear scolded service provider limitation hindered people essential updated health information behavioral modification appropriate action illness found age group nilnate found older adult low moderate health literacy score limitation education plus deterioration ear eye affect self-care management skill competency accessing understanding reporting health knowledge therefore teaching older people take short time divided session consist explanation practice practice must simple uncomplicated suitable place repeated teaching training session teaching style must consider context culture older people using proper medium large visible text simple language age-friendly color seen easily clearly addition teaching material available older people take home review participation teaching practice process would promote learning memorization practicing confidence principle giving health education older adult considered developing intervention solve delay seeking treatment acute myocardial infarction situation limitation four limitation found study first selected outcome impossible meta-analysis three variable included second publication bias also found study aware applying result third egger test lead misleading result number study small concern considered interpreting result finally study two country usa germany result systematic review would limit especially detail intervention narrative method intervention developed based context study setting principle applied conclusion recommendation older adult significant group experiencing ami delaying treatment causing high mortality rate factor related delay differ age group specific characteristic aging process limit recognizing symptom learning new information study revealed included intervention might suit adequate older adult survive ami situation specific characteristic aging process would concern developing intervention therefore specific intervention related limitation need considered developing intervention future study practice
