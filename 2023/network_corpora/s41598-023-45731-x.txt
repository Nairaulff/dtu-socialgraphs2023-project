million estimated united state resulting significant public health burden based data national health interview survey recently united state approximately million people symptomatic knee osteoarthritis approximately million ethnic/racial minority thus identifying potentially modifiable protective risk factor may lead development available strategy delay progression reduce public health burden well-established smoking linked chronic disease diabetes cardiovascular disease cancer also recognized risk factor many chronic musculoskeletal disease including rheumatoid arthritis degenerative disc disease low back pain however smoking reportedly negatively associated ulcerative colitis parkinson disease relationship smoking established many clinical study different region population shown smoking negatively associated incidence evidence suggesting bmi non-smokers usually higher smoker leading high prevalence however scholar raised doubt protective effect smoking observed epidemiological study due selection bias especially hospital selection bias cross-sectional research nationally representative data south korea association found direct smoking previous smoking

statistically significant however adjusting bmi confounding factor still found positive association smoking smoking documented exert heterogeneous effect different country region example smoking found protective factor joint replacement severe knee singaporean chinese cohort cohort study rotterdam population showed smoking risk factor reliability many study concluded smoking protective factor questioned due study design bias indeed hospital-based study represent significant source bias smoking likely cause health problem led non-osteoarthritis patient smoke included study widely established u.s. population dominated non-hispanic white multivariable regression analysis risk non-hispanic white 2.39 time higher mexican american suspect effect smoking different ethnic group may lead regional variation study multicenter trial found increased risk gastrointestinal metaplasia gim among hispanic born outside united state among hispanic born united state finding suggests member ethnic group born living different area may different susceptibility risk factor accordingly effect smoking varies across country region present exact mechanism smoking poorly understood interestingly study shown nicotine alters protein including several protease cytokine model joint inflammation including increased nicotine secretion matrix metalloproteinase increased secretion two proposed marker chitinase 3-like protein fibronectin indeed essential increase awareness risk prevent occurrence improve quality life patient population current evidence suggests age significant risk factor age addition risk also significantly correlated bmi gender race finding suggest people reduce smoking reduce risk addition smoking cause variety harmful effect carcinogen chemical strength study included large-scale nature use national cohort data absence selection bias however although nhanes representative sample general population united state cross-sectional study requires validation effect smoking prospective study addition questionnaire used determine whether participant patient although response rate gold standard determining imaging physical examination performed determine whether participant absence covariates job strain physical activity vitamin level subsequent multivariate analysis nhanes also limitation besides quantify smoking explore influence amount smoking incidence however demonstrated smoking increase risk current smoker past smoker based data large population conclusion large national cross-sectional study showed smoking positively associated prevalence population necessary study relationship smoking determine specific mechanism smoking
