introduction knowledge graph gained increasing popularity last decade science technology enable versatile evolving semantic representation knowledge crossroad various level information structuring unstructured semi-structured structured level abstraction conceptual vs. operational knowledge representation formalism graph fact entity-relationship logic technology ecosystem however publicly available knowledge graph dbpedia wikidata relatively simple moderate semantic structure although vary content size coverage overlap primarily represent collection factual statement arranged entity description possibly enriched class hierarchy corresponding property definition question answering benchmark system far geared primarily towards encyclopedic knowledge graph dbpedia wikidata currently new type knowledge graph called research knowledge graph emerging whose content bibliographic metadata scientific element idea theory approach claim conveyed scholarly contribution omics data
