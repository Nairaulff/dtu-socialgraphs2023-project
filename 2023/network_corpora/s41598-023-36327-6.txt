introduction classification fibrotic interstitial pneumonia vital predicting prognosis deciding treatment plan however diagnosis fibrotic remains challenging even expert specializing respiratory disease study reported high interobserver variability identification fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis fhp one study based diagnostic algorithm suggested nearly half current hypersensitivity
