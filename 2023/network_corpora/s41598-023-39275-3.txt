introduction know 1.9 billion adult worldwide overweight million obese staggering number reflect global health crisis far-reaching consequence obesity characterized excessive body fat accumulation become pressing issue affecting individual age socioeconomic background merely cosmetic concern complex condition significant implication overall health well-being obesity pose numerous health risk associated range chronic disease including diabetes cardiovascular disease certain type cancer obesity significantly contributes morbidity reduced life expectancy cardiovascular disease cvd cancer accounting greatest mortality risk moreover place enormous burden healthcare system contributes rising healthcare cost cause obesity multifactorial involving combination genetic environmental behavioral factor unhealthy dietary pattern high consumption processed food sugary beverage coupled sedentary lifestyle play pivotal role development progression obesity effort address global epidemic require comprehensive approach encompassing individual behavior change community intervention policy initiative encouraging healthier eating habit promoting physical activity fostering supportive environment crucial step towards curbing obesity crisis additionally raising awareness long-term health consequence obesity importance preventive measure essential promoting healthier future researcher strive understand complex factor contributing obesity recent study begun explore potential influence daytime napping weight management modern fast-paced society sleep deprivation become increasingly common many individual getting enough restorative sleep night sleep deficit led rise daytime napping way compensate lack sleep daytime napping linked various health benefit including improved cognitive function mood association obesity remains subject investigation previous research relationship daytime napping obesity risk generated conflicting inconsistent finding study indicated potential association increased daytime napping higher risk obesity instance study found excessive daytime napping linked higher body mass index bmi increased odds obese however study reported different outcome suggesting significant association even possible inverse relationship daytime napping obesity risk addition study reported daytime napping associated lower risk obesity conflicting finding may attributed difference study design sample size measurement method across various study considering inconsistency limitation previous research necessary conduct meta-analysis better understand relationship daytime napping risk obesity study aim address knowledge gap comprehensive meta-analysis existing literature leveraging large diverse sample size objective measurement meticulous control potential confounding variable elucidating relationship enhance understanding potential impact daytime napping obesity risk provide valuable insight public health strategy aimed addressing global obesity epidemic study aim examine potential relationship daytime napping obesity risk investigating whether correlation napping duration body weight hope shed light role napping

development obesity meta-analysis included twelve study 170,134 individual found daytime napping associated increased risk obesity conducting subgroup analysis based nap duration definition obesity interesting finding emerged nap duration greater one hour significant increase occurrence obesity clear relationship nap duration one hour obesity moreover diagnostic criterion obesity set bmi greater equal significant relationship napping obesity however diagnostic criterion set bmi greater equal napping found significantly increase risk obesity finding suggest relationship napping obesity may influenced duration nap diagnostic criterion used define obesity even adjusting bias conducting sensitivity analysis association daytime nap obesity remained strong therefore research needed better understand complex relationship napping obesity determine effective strategy reducing risk obesity individual nap regularly mechanism behind association daytime napping obesity exact mechanism underlying association daytime napping obesity still unclear however speculated mechanism may help explain relationship first daytime napping activate sympathetic nervous system associated obesity therefore daytime napping may influence obesity second daytime napping may extend bedtime could decrease thermogenesis energy expenditure potentially leading obesity third previous study discovered daytime napping depression significant positive association depressive symptom associated diminishing oestradiol level throughout transition menopause moreover significant association menopause obesity found therefore menopause may played key part relationship daytime napping obesity fourth excessive daytime sleep may worsen insomnia night fragmented sleep linked higher bmi increased risk obesity fifth circadian rhythm significant impact body hormone recent research found excessive daytime napping associated elevated nighttime cortisol level could increase insulin resistance lead abnormal blood lipid fat distribution finally daytime napping could sign insufficient poor sleep quality could contributing factor association daytime napping obesity study discussion potential mechanism underlying association daytime napping obesity speculative based existing literature important acknowledge mechanism require investigation direct evidence support validity hypothesis help illustrate potential biological mechanism underlying association daytime napping obesity provide clue exploration field strength limitation meta-analysis based latest literature largest comprehensive clinical study date sample size 170,134 advantage meta-analysis inclusion large population making outcome persuasive however several limitation consider firstly information whether participant took nap duration nap mostly obtained questionnaire survey may influenced sleep quality emotion potentially leading obesity enhance assessment participant sleep pattern quality future study could incorporate objective measure actigraphy mitigate potential bias associated self-reported data objective measure would provide accurate reliable information leading robust understanding relationship daytime napping obesity risk secondly majority study conducted china usa one study spain thus finding may generalizable population country increasing number study included analysis particularly diverse range country would indeed enhance generalizability finding including study conducted various cultural geographical context better understand relationship daytime napping obesity risk may vary across different population thirdly exploring potential influence lifestyle factor diet physical activity association daytime napping obesity important avenue future research considering additional factor better elucidate complex interplay napping behavior lifestyle choice obesity risk fourth essential note current study establish causal relationship daytime napping obesity due limitation available data future study consider longitudinal design randomized controlled trial provide stronger evidence causality fifth study assumes equivalence diagnostic criterion obesity across study crucial recognize variation obesity defined could influence finding future study account difference obesity criterion explore potential heterogeneity result finally considering potential influence medication use underlying medical condition daytime napping obesity important consideration future research aim gather relevant information factor better understand potential impact observed association conclusion result meta-analysis suggest positive association daytime napping risk obesity independent potential confounding factor however additional high-quality study needed elucidate potential role daytime napping development obesity
