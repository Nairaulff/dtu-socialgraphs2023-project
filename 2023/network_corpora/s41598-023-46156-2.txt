current study first show differential impact soil temperature virulence reniformis floridensis previous study reported existence virulence phenotype reniformis meaning substantial variability reproduction virulence present geographic isolates although previous study mention possible reason behind existence virulence phenotype difference soil temperature may influenced biology reniformis seems reasonable predict increased crop loss higher soil temperature due increased nematode virulence however study needed determine whether soil temperature beyond limit current study lead increase virulence nematode furthermore higher temperature adversely affect plant growth development altered plant physiology may contributed increased nematode virulence disease severity higher temperature current study found root gall index measure disease severity root-knot nematode positively correlated soil temperature reproduction floridensis significantly decreased soil temperature increased disease severity significantly increased suggests floridensis becomes aggressive higher temperature leading increased crop loss make sense greater root biomass plant infected floridensis mentioned
