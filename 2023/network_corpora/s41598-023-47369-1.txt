clinical symptom patient hospital may severe symptom age distribution patient different according reddit usage statistic http people age year reddit largest user base reddit user year clinical study

unverifiable since self-reported inherent reliance self-reporting may introduces potential bias subsequent analysis category reported symptom overlapped e.g. chest pain/difficulty breathing pain/aches symptom may appear under-reported captured anticipated category misspelling grammatical error even crude abbreviation word phrase post make model unable incorrectly extract symptom lack standardization—this issue capturing patient demographic information forced rely spontaneous communication symptom opposed survey targeted question addition model trained using data sars-cov-2 early period derived symptom key-word corpus fixed model may recognize new symptom first occurred latter two variant period still key-word corpus contains almost key word corresponding symptom thus inability capture symptom would occurred new unexpected symptom occurred future plan train quadarm model data covering longer covid-19 prevalence period exhaustive symptom list furthermore exists potential advancing broadening scope approach integration complementary method technique instance accounting diverse communication preference among different subreddit group incorporating research emotion-related content within reddit platform could help mitigate bias symptom extraction additionally enhancing model utilization multi-question technique hold promise achieving higher precision
