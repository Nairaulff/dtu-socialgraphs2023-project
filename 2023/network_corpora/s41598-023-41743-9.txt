diabetic foot ulcer higher sub-saharan africa need increased focus investment improving management diabetic foot ulcer sub-saharan africa may include development new treatment protocol provision better resource healthcare provider well increased education awareness diabetic patient additionally may need increased research antimicrobial resistance pattern region order inform future policy decision related public health infection control health system sub-saharan africa must implement real-time laboratory surveillance identification pathogen determine antimicrobial resistance profile country sub-saharan africa must establish common data-sharing platform could inform evidence regarding antimicrobial resistance profile eskape pathogen
