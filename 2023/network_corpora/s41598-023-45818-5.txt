introduction osteoarthritis common chronic condition present pain dysfunction symptomatic knee occurs men woman aged year respectively rate likely increase result obesity epidemic population aging worldwide japan ten million people estimated suffer knee sleep disturbance common among adult particularly japanese cohort seriously affect quality life qol worsened sleep disturbance japan attributed combination cultural societal lifestyle factor e.g. long working hour noise light pollution urban area chronic stress due competitive education system job market lifestyle habit young age organization economic co-operation development reported among country japan shortest sleep duration min shorter average time furthermore approximately 30–80 patient knee reported suffer insomnia knee oa-related insomnia could linked greater pain decreased physical function central pain modulatory process increasingly recognized possible underlying mechanism linking disturbed sleep pain total knee arthroplasty tka considered effective treatment patient knee providing pain relief improving gait restoring activity daily living several previous prospective study western country investigated sleep
