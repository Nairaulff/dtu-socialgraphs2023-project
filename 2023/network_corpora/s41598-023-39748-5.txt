introduction according latest report world health organization 38.4 million people living hiv plwh globally end study predicted nearly plwh care treatment hiv older end iran model-based projection estimate 54,850 people hiv positive 15,552 antiretroviral therapy treatment also diagnosed case age group 20–45 year time diagnosis although plwh used large number antiretroviral therapy art recent year rapid expansion access treatment elderly hiv-positive patient challenge globally including increase comorbidity non-communicable disease ncds cardiovascular disease cvd type diabetes mellitus
