introduction quaternary history flora europe largely shaped climatic oscillation pleistocene 2.58 million 11.7 thousand year ago accompanied drop temperature increase snowfall favored formation thick ice cover decreasing temperature result pleistocene experienced several glacial phase strongly influenced geographic range many plant animal specie difficult climatic condition thousand year period low temperature climate cooling higher temperature interglacials resulted alternately shrinking splitting range specie often led isolation population contrast warmer period many population specie moved back original range return migration recolonization condition range specie expanded led restoration gene flow however genetic change occurred population isolated glaciation often led complex mechanism speciation refugial population long-term isolation substantially affect genetic diversity reduce population size evolutionary process may turn take place recently colonized area process founder effect bottleneck effect cause reduction impoverishment gene pool population turn opposite process may take place contact zone migrating population may increase genetic diversity tracking change transformation flora thousand year difficult limited research possibility study fossil material palynology perform molecular research reason difficulty resulting collection research material little research would allow in-depth understanding process occurred plant specie population pleistocene although study variability genetic differentiation population found alp carpathians study

intensified gene flow creating large gene pool among formerly distant population similar mechanism also proposed alpine plant endemic eastern alp perhaps local cryptic refugia played role carpathians
