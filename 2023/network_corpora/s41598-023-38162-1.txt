leading cause death among infected patient addition respiratory complication covid-19 associated increased risk cardiovascular event heart attack stroke thrombosis patient pre-existing cardiovascular disease risk factor hypertension diabetes obesity may particularly susceptible complication although interaction covid-19 cardiovascular disease yet fully understand covid-19 pandemic highlighted significant impact viral infection cardiovascular system patient pre-existing cardiovascular disease well risk factor hypertension diabetes obesity increased risk severe illness death covid-19 virus capable directly damaging heart blood vessel triggering systemic inflammatory response exacerbate existing cardiovascular condition great interest appropriate risk assessment covid-19 patient attempt

cardiovascular risk represented risk score mortality patient severe covid-19 ards three different risk score investigated study derived different patient collective also require different parameter calculate framingham risk score well-established tool predicting cardiovascular risk individual based various risk factor age sex cholesterol level blood pressure smoking status primarily score used predict risk myocardial infarction within next year procam prospective cardiovascular munster score risk assessment tool developed identify individual high risk developing cardiovascular disease respectively risk suffering heart attack within year score considers several risk factor including age gender smoking status blood pressure cholesterol level family history cardiovascular disease currently already several scientific study association different score severity mortality covid-19 patient charlson comorbidity index cci said best predictive capability severe outcome hospitalized

score significance covid-19 ards patient result demonstrate procam score tool measuring cardiovascular risk significantly predicts mortality critically ill covid-19 ards patient framingham risk score cci differ significantly may due fact procam score considers triglyceride low- high density lipoprotein cholesterol value framingham score considers high density lipoprotein cholesterol total cholesterol value cci doe consider lipid value study suggested low density lipoprotein cholesterol level may associated higher risk severe covid-19 high triglyceride level may associated worse outcome already shown many study animal human triglyceride level increase result various cytokine release accordingly reasonable assume also applies covid-19 ards patient higher level triglyceride subsequently associated increased mortality shown study furthermore find association cardiovascular risk occurrence mace icu stay covid-19 patient could find reason possibly bacterial superinfection already suggested musuuza predominant cause death covid-19 patient maybe influence result rapid lethal course one potential mechanism underlying association cardiovascular risk represented procam score mortality covid-19 ards patient direct damage heart blood vessel virus sars-cov-2 shown infect endothelial cell cause endotheliitis lead thrombosis cardiovascular complication furthermore systemic inflammatory response triggered virus also contribute cardiovascular complication worsen existing condition procam score previously validated tool predicting cardiovascular risk general population study demonstrates utility predicting mortality covid-19 ards patient highlighting importance identifying managing cardiovascular risk factor patient calculated ppv yield ppv rate npv promising result encourage evaluation risk score prognostic parameter mortality icu-setting however kept mind sample represents highly specific cohort therefore generalization made cautiously foremost score cut-offs must validated independent sample limitation study association cardiovascular risk mortality covid-19 ards patient provides important insight high-risk population important acknowledge several limitation may impact generalizability finding one significant limitation study low number patient included research question sufficient sample size detect significant association procam score triglyceride mortality larger sample size may provided robust result allowed in-depth analysis relationship variable analysing effect size could however demonstrate observed effect large also put group size perspective another limitation study measured lipid level admittance intensive care unit mean information lipid level may changed time determine whether change lipid level icu stay may impacted outcome future study may benefit measuring lipid level multiple time point throughout hospitalization better understand relationship lipid level outcome covid-19 ards patient finally study conducted single center may limit generalizability finding population setting additional research needed determine whether similar association procam score triglyceride mortality observed patient population healthcare system conclusion conclusion study provides important insight association cardiovascular risk factor mortality covid-19 ards patient admitted intensive care unit finding highlight importance identifying managing pre-existing cardiovascular disease risk factor patient procam score remains important tool assessing cardiovascular risk may important factor predicting mortality covid-19 ards patient research needed fully understand mechanism underlying association develop targeted effective strategy managing cardiovascular risk high-risk population ultimately comprehensive approach managing covid-19 ards patient take account respiratory cardiovascular factor may essential improving outcome reducing mortality
