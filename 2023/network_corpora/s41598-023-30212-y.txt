introduction dyslipidemia defined lipid abnormality including elevated total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl-c triglyceride declined high-density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl-c prevalence hypertriglyceridemia hypercholesterolemia high non-hdl low hdl iranian adult 26.7 39.5 69.2 respectively abnormality lipid profile associated many clinical outcome type diabetes cardiovascular disease cvds also main cause half case congenital heart disease four million death annually complex interaction genetic factor several environmental factor smoking sedentary lifestyle socioeconomic situation determinant lipid profile particularly taking food rich calorie carbohydrate sodium cholesterol trans saturated fatty acid related high concentration ldl-c. hand consumption polyunsaturated fatty acid vegetable dietary fiber milk dairy product could decrease risk dyslipidemia nova classification system considering physical biological chemical property food also additive

also showed positive association upfs intake incidence abdominal obesity adult systematic review meta-analysis multi-national cohort study also reported positive association higher consumption upfs general abdominal obesity assume opposite finding due high mean participant weight whr upfs often calorie-dense contain large amount fat saturated fat trans fat sodium simple sugar high glycemic index contain small amount fiber vitamin mineral bioactive compound naturally exist fresh food nutritionally unbalanced several mechanism suggested explain adverse effect ufps lipid profile health first due intrinsic palatability overconsumption upfs may result physiological disruption hunger satiety pattern besides energy-dense food usually contain high amount free sugar trans fat enhance lipogenesis decrease fatty acid oxidation lead aggregation tissue blood circulation elevated ldl level furthermore partially hydrogenated vegetable oil content upfs contain trans fatty acid adverse impact lipid profile addition scientific evidence support hypothesis interacting effect substance produced high-heat processing oil determine health effect heat processing also cause degradation food substance formation furan upfs higher intake upfs increase exposure phthalates used packing process could transfer food accumulation phthalates bisphenols furan metabolite may ultimately lead lower hdl-c elevated level disruption endocrine function evidence shown urinary concentration phthalates metabolite positively associated negatively associated ldl level hand impact carbohydrate lipid profile also depends source processing method consumption free sugar elevates serum whole grain intake decrease ldl level consumption minimally-processed whole grain oatmeal instead highly processed refined grain may improve lipid profile study limitation follows first nature cross-sectional study able ass causal correlation upfs intake lipid profile second place study done shiraz city generalized
