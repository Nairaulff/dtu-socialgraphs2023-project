overcrowding significantly associated clustering indicating homeless individual risk developing also linked recent transmission population strain ethiopia_3 sub-lineage likely clustered could suggest frequent transmission strain homeless individual although number isolates small 8.9 isolates resistant one first-line ant-tb drug study ethiopia country reported similar percentage drug resistance fortunately mdr isolate detected isolates study similarly study conducted earlier reported absence mdr isolates nonetheless risk factor development mdr homeless individual expected likely limitation study used culturing tuberculosis small number isolates used study could limit precision estimate relationship homelessness moreover lower sensitivity phenotypic dst method lack molecular confirmation drug resistance strain tuberculosis could also limit precision result however regardless limitation result study could considered valued input control program country conclusion present study
