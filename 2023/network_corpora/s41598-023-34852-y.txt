introduction early world health organization raised concern antimicrobial resistance whole-of-society problem government around world control infection slow development drug resistance human may die various infectious disease caused superbug without effective treatment resistance multiple antimicrobial drug occurs different type bacteria example bacteria broad-spectrum lactamases treated third fourth generation cephalosporin esbl-like bacterium resistant third fourth generation cephalosporin enzyme inhibitor target resistance ampc-like bacterium resistant enzyme inhibitor carbapenems may better choice case abusing antibiotic easy produce extensive drug resistance dangerous super bacterium sounded alarm mankind rational use antibiotic major issue related human health antibiotic double-edged sword rational use antibiotic effectively treat infectious disease caused pathogenic bacteria greatly reduce death caused infection however unreasonable use antibiotic lead continuous growth bacterial drug resistance increase heavy resistance cure disease affect health mankind reasonably control use antibiotic reduce production drug-resistant strain become matter widespread concern world reported relevant measure taken million people world die prematurely million per year economic loss amount trillion therefore maintaining effective effect antibiotic limiting microbial drug resistance common goal country nosocomial infection surveillance japan antibiotic resistance surveillance shared global antibiotic resistance monitoring system provides favorable tool monitoring drug-resistant bacteria united state point overuse antibiotic major health care problem leading antibiotic resistance including unnecessary long-term antibiotic treatment patient common bacterial infection acute bronchitis exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd community-acquired pneumonia cap urinary tract infection utis cellulitis infection require appropriate prescription short-term antibiotic treatment canada also took action antimicrobial resistance antimicrobial use increase effectiveness treatment infectious disease facilitate compliance international guideline antibiotic resistance china one largest antibiotic consuming country world face threat antibiotic resistance order strengthen clinical application management antibiotic medical institution promote rational use antibiotic effectively control bacterial resistance ensure medical quality safety china taken number measure strengthen management antibiotic chinese government committed solving problem improper use antibiotic strengthening management antibiotic national health family planning commission nhfpc launched special antimicrobial stewardship campaign sac strengthen management antibiotic clinical use secondary patient bed fewer tertiary patient bed hospital china scholar exploring result achieved special rectification antibiotic china analyzing use antibiotic procurement data antibiotic example total hospital antibiotic use china increased 4.8 6.7 different across province also varies hospital level population-weighted antibiotic use higher level hospital level iii

outpatient inpatient roughly see scale hospital therefore seen hospital largest scale ratio antibacterial drug cost total drug cost highest contrary whether ratio antibacterial drug cost relatively low show use antibiotic also relatively standardised relatively large-scale hospital consistent report kangkang yan reported antibiotic injection prescription accounted 26.6 antibiotic prescription secondary hospital share 14.2 tertiary hospital within shaanxi province western china total number antibiotic decreased compared number oral product increased also show signal medical institution gradually formed consensus try give oral preparation take orally study shown use oral antibiotic bone joint infection inferior intravenous injection seen hospital comprehensive hospital figure depicts main antibiotic used year study cephalosporin Î²-lactamase inhibitor compound preparation high use amount interestingly peak use two type antibiotic may due restriction variety antibiotic first year sac use rate outpatient inpatient antibiotic showed downward trend indicating effect sac use rate antibiotic hospitalized patient basically maintained tertiary care hospital beijing reported use rate antibiotic inpatient however result cross-sectional survey nursing home cohort united state showed use rate antibiotic 8.2 show still gap use antimicrobial drug china use intensity antibiotic hospitalized patient exceed ddd per bed-days according guideline clinical use antimicrobial drug hereinafter referred guideline seen fig sac hospital could meet standard far exceeding value indicating use antibiotic may seriously unreasonable sac although use intensity antibiotic hospital still greater ddd per bed-days decreased significantly use intensity antibiotic hospital lower ddd per bed-days showed effect sac remarkable process sac china utilization rate outpatient antibiotic inpatient antibiotic decreased consistent hospital china reported certain risk infection surgical site operation risk infection surgical site surgery variety perioperative intervention help reduce incidence surgical site infection ssi procedure require antibiotic prophylaxis according guideline perioperative prophylactic use rate antibiotic class incision surgery 30.0 however indicated perioperative abuse antibiotic class incision surgery serious sac improved still failed meet standard hospital met standard minimum 16.46 hospital particularly hospital still reason may hospital comprehensive tertiary hospital patient treated difficult severe difficult surgery long time complicated chronic disease resulting need preventive use antibiotic perioperative period term medication timing proportion preventing use antibiotic within minâ1 surgery low however generally reached even one hospital 51.03 may hospital located poor county china medical resource underdeveloped article reported use perioperative antibiotic two italian hospital proportion antibiotic administered within min operation also different local level hospital cesarean section one-time prophylactic application antibiotic min operation effectively prevent infection cesarean section shorten hospital stay according analysis type antibiotic used found cephalosporin used antibiotic hospital similar hospital saudi arabia one hand may due large number variety cephalosporin one two three four five generation hand wide antibacterial spectrum relatively side effect commonly used antibacterial drug outpatient inpatient secondly enzyme inhibitor quinolones account largest proportion consistent situation shanghai china carbapenems glycopeptides linezolid mostly used treatment severe antibiotic-resistant infection relatively infrequently drug country also corresponding guideline guide rational use antibiotic guideline vancomycin united state use management carbapenem antibiotic japan southeast asian country however also deficiency article situation drug-resistant bacteria analyzed monitoring bacterial drug resistance also provide strong basis clinical control infection prevention new drug-resistant strain rational application antibiotic help implement situation drug-resistant bacteria next step although year development various indicator antibiotic medical institution china greatly improved still many problem chaotic variety antibiotic clinical application high utilization rate great difference different region severe challenge situation bacterial drug resistance reason problem management system supervision ability rational drug use ability level rational drug use medical personnel also public awareness rational drug use need joint effort state society medical personnel jointly promote rational use antibiotic conclusion long-term sac improve clinical application antibiotic rationality use antibiotic medical institution level southern sichuan greatly improved use rate antibiotic outpatient inpatient perioperative preventive drug significantly improved clinical application management antibiotic related medical quality safety patient hospital continue strengthen training medical personnel rational application antibiotic standardized management improve refine rule regulationsand promote rational application antibiotic hospital
