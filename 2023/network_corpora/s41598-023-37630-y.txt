introduction zika virus zikv member genus flavivirus family flaviviridae arbovirus primarily transmitted infected mosquito past two decade several large zikv outbreak one occurred western pacific island yap federated state micronesia another occurred french polynesia south pacific 2013–2014 yet another happened central south american country west africa 2015–2016 following event number infectious case decreased recent year study revealed country known native mosquito-borne zikv indicating threat zikv infection remains concern preventive measure avoiding mosquito bite preventing travelling anywhere zikv spreading suggested addition mosquito bite zikv spread route blood transfusion sexual intercourse maternal-to-fetal vertical infection multiple infection route make difficult public health issue suggest next outbreak may limited tropical country infection zikv may result asymptomatic mild symptom including fever rash muscle pain conjunctivitis people mild symptom get
