introduction blinking integral ocular surface integrity distributing pre-corneal tear film thus protecting ocular surface environmental hazard besides removal ocular debris foreign body categorically blinking two main form voluntary involuntary blinking specifically voluntary blinking result decision blink involuntary blinking either reflex automatic response object invading eye spontaneous blinking perception information processing accordingly borsch defines spontaneous blinking automatic closure eyelid without external stimulation systematically restore tear film tear film composed three layer first layer aqueous layer produced lacrimal gland rich protein substance second layer lipid layer produced meibomian gland prevents tear evaporation lastly mucin layer produced goblet cell prevents friction corneal surface consequence blink pattern reflects time tear film remains intact following blink physiologically blinking involves contracting antagonistic muscle levator palpebrae superioris orbicularis oculus alternatively push–pull fashion control cortical system blink rate significant indicator systemic ocular condition systemically low blink rate indicates hypodopaminergic activity e.g parkinson disease progressive supranuclear palsy attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder high blink rate indicative hyperdopaminergic activity e.g huntington disease schizophrenia neuro-developmental condition ocular surface low brink rate risk factor dry eye due tear evaporation disruption tear film initiate ocular symptom discomfort eye strain burning sensation excessive lacrimation pain visual disturbance normal spontaneous blink rate among human recorded blink per minute attributed large inter individual difference partly lack unified measuring method clinically diverse technique measure spontaneous blink rate ranging sophisticated procedure involving videoscope video camera simple manual observation needle say gold standard blink rate value absolute apparently many different factor temperature attention air draught speed lighting affect blink rate thus dissimilar value normal blink rate reported elsewhere regardless best knowledge lack data normative value blink rate malawian population given blink rate vary climatic condition also measurement method therefore assessment aimed providing healthcare practitioner reference value blink rate population measured using cheap convenient equipment addition evaluates age gender difference blink rate among population group result study aid clinical diagnosis medical ocular problem low resource setting method conducted quantitative cross-sectional study mzuzu university malawi target population student aged 15–49 year age study recruited total participant employed stratified random sampling

similar zametkin nevertheless disparate blink rate value reported different setting instance relatively lower 12.83 7.64 blinks/min switzerland higher saudi arabia 19.74 9.12 blinks/min japan 18.2 14.1 blinks/min variation could due different weather condition disparate area understudy according nakamori humidity affect blinking rate increasing tear evaporation part could also due different technique employed measuring blink rate likewise previous study current study found significant correlation blink rate age even though sugiyama colleague study establish normative data different age group using wider age range reported significant positive correlation age blink rate among infant older age group concluded birth neaonates blink infrequently blink rate increase stabilizing age year significant age related change occur result study unsurprising given age range understudy 15–45 study focus wider age group elucidate phenomenon regarding sex study found statistically non-significant difference blink rate value although female slightly lower blink rate compared male 0.8143 accord doughty contrary bentivoglio colleague found higher blinking rate among woman men however evaluated blink rate relation behavioral task instance reading result study could attributed nature blink rate study ass blink rate reading activity despite sex related difference mainly due hormone adnexal ocular surface tissue including conjunctiva lacrimal gland larger inter-individual variability blink rate disguise smaller gender effect study without limitation main limitation environment understudy fully controlled result could affected daily temperature change moreover study differentiate intentional unintentional blinking would affected result furthermore sample size small could considered national regional representation addition age range narrow hence could fully elucidate effect age younger older age group main strength study offer benchmark blink rate malawian population furthermore study cheap noninvasive appliance applicable low resource setting result could significant future research survey involving external eye malawi conclusion average blink rate among malawian young adult within expected normal range however different setting average blink rate 16.04 6.417 related age sex confirms blink rate varies according climatic condition study include wider age range confirm finding age group study ass blink rate different behavioral tasks/activities finding study provide critical insight regarding blink behavior pattern malawian measure individual engagement scene
