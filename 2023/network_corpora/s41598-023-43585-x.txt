significantly better performance compared counterpart chart instant n=10 0.03,0.05,0.1\ 0.2 =0.1\ proposed chart arl_1=13.2 15.4 17.9 21.3\ whereas corresponding arl_1=44.8 48.5 52.1 52.9\ hwma-sr chart result noticed considerably improved performance hwma-sr repetitive chart compared hwma-sr chart moreover also noticed increase arl_1\ also increase level shift sample size trend also noticed chart run-length acatalectic value proposed chart reported table observed arl_1\ value proposed chart auxiliary hwma-sr chart shift process moreover also seen decreasing trend level shift arl_1\ value value increase arl_1\ value increased value increase example n=10 =0.10 0.1\ 0.05 0.25 0.5 0.75 arl_1\ value auxiliary hwma-sr repetitive chart 12.7 12.5 11.5 arl_1\ value existing chart 52.1 44.5

proposed chart detect out-of-control signal earlier proposed chart used industry production various quality product saving money time scope proposed chart investigated using different nonparametric test well-known sampling technique
