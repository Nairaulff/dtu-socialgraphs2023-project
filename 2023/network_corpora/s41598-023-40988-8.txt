lernaea specie discussion based importance parasitic infection one concerning problem affecting ornamental fish attempting gain better understanding parasitic infestation affecting ornamental fish may play important role success ornamental fish industry although overall prevalence parasitized fish visited ornamental fish farm particularly high 20.00 presence detectable parasite level significance majority parasite recovered freshwater fish iran potential induce significant mortality among captive wild stock particularly parasite typically require intermediate host ciliated protozoan copepod crustacean therefore proper diagnosis treatment prevention parasitic infection essential maintaining health well-being ornamental fish captivity includes regular monitoring screening parasite implementing effective biosecurity measure providing appropriate water quality nutrition reduce stress susceptibility parasitic infection ornamental fish farmer ensure long-term sustainability
