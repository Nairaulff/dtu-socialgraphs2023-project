introduction artistic swimming synchronized swimming aesthetic sport combining element swimming dance gymnastics performed music among different form artistic swimming competition team free routine featuring artistic swimmer prominent category team free routine first introduced olympic game sydney replacing solo routine performed single artistic swimmer since artistic swimming popular around world incorporated various international championship world powerhouse artistic swimming traditionally include russia china ukraine japan accumulated numerous olympic medal team free routine total score comprises three key element execution artistic expression difficulty accounting total score respectively execution difficulty score mainly determined based performance synchronized level figure swimmer inverted position leg move following choreography water pattern geometric formation created eight swimmer including limited square rectangle triangle straight line curve line whereas artistic impression score primarily depend variety creativity choreography similar aesthetic sport figure skating artistic gymnastics artistic swimming score determined subjective evaluation panel judge objective measurement distance time height track field event applied even though detail evaluation criterion scoring scale provided fina artistic swimming rule abstract artistic impression score remain highly subjective thus may result inconsistency scoring across different judge competition objectify scoring aesthetic sport like figure skating advanced action recognition approach developed sport video analysis several study employed machine learning deep learning algorithm predict figure skating competition score however technique method yet used artistic swimming competition thus necessary introduce news method objectively score artistic swimming team free routine artistic swimming consists hybrid figure set choreographed leg movement performed water level difficulty one important component team free routine complex varied play key role competition composed various form including barracuda albatross seagull ballerina etc several element team free routine significantly impact difficulty score execution score artistic impression score previous study shown duration underwater large impact total score judge may prefer long dive competition international competition team free routine typically duration 3–4 min artistic swimmer often spending approximately 50–65 total time submerged underwater last duration movement frequency pattern duration may important factor difficulty score execution score swimmer try reach vertical position high possible performing two leg vertical position barracuda artistic impression score main influencing factor may include movement connections—actions created swimmer link together—and rotation performed horizontal plane axis conclusion may several element closely related total score however research relationship element score artistic swimming score prediction limited way element collectively affect total score unclear aesthetic sport previous study found subjective scoring competitive diving event mathematically modeled
