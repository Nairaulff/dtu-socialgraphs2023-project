introduction tuberculosis caused mycobacterium tuberculosis one oldest disease world cause million death annually worldwide extra-pulmonary occurs 15–20 tb-patients frequently encountered extrapulmonary form disease spinal tuberculosis also known pott´s disease cause serious clinical condition severe deformity neurological complication like complete paraplegia tetraplegia despite marked improvement socioeconomic status many country availability effective antitubercular drug impact acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aid pandemic immigration increased rate disease diagnosis often challenging delayed early diagnosis treatment necessary prevent permanent neurological disability minimize spinal deformity majority case occur population-dense developing country like africa india however due globalization travelling longer disease limited developing nation case western world spinal tuberculosis seen primarily immigrant form endemic country endemic country pott´s disease

describes neurological deficit recover well tuberculostatic drug therapy spinal tuberculosis healed without surgical procedure however owing additional problem encountered spinal kyphotic angle neurological deficit several study appealed surgical intervention recommendation surgical treatment spinal tuberculosis also include treating pronounced stenosis create better recovery possibility faster pain reduction restore mobility independence daily life surgical treatment allows achieve early decompression cord histological verification diagnosis prompt relief patient´s symptom furthermore reduces risk maintained cord compression—even successful medical treatment due unexcised granuloma replaced fibrous scar tissue patient included study treated surgically reason surgical treatment neurological deficit due mechanical compression deformity instability severe pain necrotic bone failure respond anti-tuberculous treatment park reported surgery conjuction quadruple anti-tb chemotherapy favourable result also reported case combined surgical intervention tended favourable outcome analyzed case conservative therapy anti-tb chemotherapy concomitant pulmonary already started
