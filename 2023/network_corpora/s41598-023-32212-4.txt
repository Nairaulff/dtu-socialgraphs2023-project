disease thought environmental trigger required produce disease-related autoantibody immune dysregulation subsequent disease expression thus absence trigger thus absence disease association genetic predisposition disease-associated biomarkers would expected also possible prevalence subclinical incomplete disease may higher population estimate would suggest polygenic predictor effective detecting subclinical disease association examining continuous disease feature scenario would expected effect size magnitude association wbc level would greater among woman higher incidence rate compared men
