introduction childhood adolescence marked large decline physical activity participation age year physical activity level typically start decrease average rate annually although participation proportion change different rate across various type physical activity evidence suggests adolescent likely sustain participation individual physical activity group-based activity beyond activity type also important describe longitudinal participation physical activity different context example organized e.g. structured activity requiring coach/instructor payment unorganized e.g. unstructured activity without coach/instructor limited rule form physical activity may different probability sustained time given unique barrier opportunity availability cost yet sustainability change physical activity participation well-understood recent study published existing evidence limited relatively short follow-up period e.g. time point covering year physical activity type and/or context examined furthermore none study identify predictor sustainability change physical activity participation critical understand type physical activity likely maintained participation specific physical activity likely discontinued help inform guide intervention effort aimed enhancing physical activity participation throughout adolescence one potential predictor change physical activity participation adolescence onset puberty puberty transition childhood adulthood characterized biological maturation inter-individual between-gender difference puberty timing associated multiple biological e.g. increased height weight strength fat mass psychosocial e.g. self-esteem body image concern change challenge adolescent relation physical activity involvement comparing same-age youth earlier-maturing boy might benefit greater height weight strength advantage could facilitate continued participation however earlier-maturing girl typically active due host anthropometric psychological variable including change body composition feeling self-consciousness lower self-concept steep drop girl participation sport around time puberty often anecdotally described challenge developmental change association puberty timing physical activity discontinuation unorganized individual physical activity context currently unclear age difference individual within age group might another factor could explain variation physical activity participation adolescence provide developmentally appropriate physical activity experience youth often grouped chronological age however born earlier year e.g. relatively older likely exposed greater number physical psychological experience relatively younger i.e. born later year counterpart might represent performance-related advantage relatively older individual within age group over-representation participant given birth quartile e.g. january-march relative participant birth quartile e.g. september-december among same-age youth termed relative age

discontinuing organized activity girl boy born april june lower risk discontinuing organized unorganized individual group-based activity participation physical activity included study declined adolescence similarity result current study conducted decade ago suggest teenage physical activity participation pattern remained largely similar line theory biological regulation possible decline physical activity adolescence simply natural part aging despite result clearly indicate individual activity generally sustained longer group-based activity unorganized activity likely sustained organized activity whereas previous study also suggested individual activity higher likelihood sustained longer group-based activity first study describe sustainability organized unorganized activity adolescence result highlight importance exposing facilitating access individual unorganized physical activity adolescent specifically result point fitness-focused activity e.g. home exercise weight training running/jogging highest potential uptake re-engagement maintenance adolescence fitness-focused activity also among frequently reported active young adult raise hypothesis could contribute lifelong physical activity participation started adolescence activity may display promise long-term participation associated relatively organizational barrier low-cost also make appealing target wide-reaching intervention observation early maturation girl predicts discontinuation organized physical activity line previous study reporting association sport participation puberty timing possible girl earlier change physical factor including increased fat mass breast development widening hip accompanied change psychosocial factor self-consciousness lower self-concept teasing leading increased likelihood dropout change modulate girl idea ideal body shape size therefore often generate dissatisfaction body turn sub-optimal self-perceived body image linked lower physical activity level potentially owing avoidance situation girl may judged appearance respect may advisable promote physical activity involve fewer opportunity physical comparison peer i.e. individual unorganized physical activity advance puberty girl active without worrying consequently important encourage girl stay active overcome self-imposed barrier associated body image misconception look physical activity early evidence show intervention improve satisfaction body-image increase intention engage physical activity contrast found association puberty timing risk dropping physical activity among boy conflict result study suggesting boy late-maturation likely dropout sport however previous study account impact uptake new physical activity following drop therefore possible puberty-associated physical activity dropout among boy nullified engagement different activity birth quartile predictor physical activity drop among boy girl study relative age effect typically identified increased proportion participant born vs. activity display vs. difference similar result found study however finding birth quartile protective unorganized physical activity discontinuation unexpected since unorganized physical activity usually practiced individual volition therefore would include selection process suggests talent selection driver relative age effect warrant future investigation correlate relative age effect might present differently unorganized physical activity organized physical activity context lack relative age effect among girl study different previous finding might reflect girl lower likelihood participate competitive sport involving selection process application frequent assessment 7-year period provided unique opportunity present comprehensive overview change participation various physical activity among adolescent addition investigating sustainability organized unorganized individual group-based physical activity provided information domain-specific dropout data also allowed describing contribution puberty relative age predictor change physical activity participation nevertheless need recognized measure based self-report could therefore associated over/under-estimation also activity classified individual might taken part others e.g. swimming given aim documenting change participation different physical activity type adolescence classification scheme individual group-based activity precluded study social context participation future investigation physical activity discontinuation consider social context participation warranted given importance social environment maintenance physical activity addition since defined discontinuation reporting activity least year unable capture activity discontinued final year study unable control confounding factor bmi association puberty timing physical activity discontinuation due data unavailability although participant retained match study purposely sampled represent mix urban/rural location variation socioeconomic status within province result may generalize sample country given national regional cultural difference physical activity sport participation researcher country and/or area could use current methodology replicate study region conclusion study highlight although marked decline participation physical activity adolescence general participation physical activity may persist sustainment activity uptake new one re-engagement others physical activity likely sustained re-engaged discontinuation initiated adolescence mostly unorganized individual activity suggests activity potential carried adulthood specifically intervention aimed fostering individual unorganized activity participation among adolescent likely worthwhile since type activity maintained longer likely reengaged organized group-based activity
