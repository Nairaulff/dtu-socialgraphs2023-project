introduction micrornas mirnas 18–24 non-coding rna play central role post-transcriptional regulation gene expression single mirna target multiple gene simultaneously alter cell growth signalling metabolic pathway dysregulation mirna expression linked human disease including severity viral infection dna rna virus including sars-cov-2 may produce mirnas manipulate expression host viral gene create environment favor viral replication several study indicate interaction host mirna system viral gene interaction may positive impact viral replication increasing translation caused change rna stability rna secondary structure however mirnas interact viral gene act defense mechanism restrict viral replication mirnas must express physiologically relevant context mean mirnas must among cell/tissue-specific mirnas also express sufficient copy number strong complementary sequence beyond seed sequence criterion important case acute viral infection chronic infection virus life cycle however noted mirnas upregulated upon inflammatory response e.g. interferon stimulation impact viral replication adjacent cell might lack mirna expression pattern therefore mirnas component innate immunity targeting sequence viral genome restrain viral replication specific cell type instance mir-142-3p binding site within eastern equine encephalitis virus eeev result inability eeev infect myeloid-lineage cell interestingly mouse model mirnas binding site mutated eev could replicate macrophage several study attempted predict host mirna interaction sars-cov-2 genome however study rely sequence complementary match therefore identify mutliple putative binding mirnas may using several independent program identified ten mirnas high complementary capacity target various region

appearance synonymous recurrence mutation unknown others noticed sars-cov-2 mutation c/g substitution doubtful result replication-dependent process majority mutation likely result apobec rna editing machinery whereas mutation probably caused reactive oxygen specie activity association rna editing machinery mirna risc complex assembly well established therefore possible interaction mirna viral gene facilitates recognition mutating region rna editing machinery might also explain high frequency recurrence mutation numerous study shown interaction virus host mirna machinery virus take advantage mirnas promote regulate replication interaction lead inability virus infect certain cell type e.g. mir-142-3p eev decrease viral replication coronaviruses largest genome known among rna virus therefore completely impossible switching new host host mirnas 6–8 complementary region may recognize sars-cov-2 genome preliminary finding using strong bioinformatic evidence backed reporter assay provided first line evidence showing possibility mir-197-5p mir-18b-5p binding sars-cov-2 genome synonymous recurrence mutation may given virus advantage escaping mirna recognition however study
