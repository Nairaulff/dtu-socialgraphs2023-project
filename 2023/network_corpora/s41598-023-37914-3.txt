harmful environment may induce oxidation inflammation intestinal tract damaging intestinal mucosal study shown cyp induce shortening shedding intestinal villus turn lead intestinal mucosal damage study pathological result showed treatment coagulans mzy531 significantly reduces shedding intestinal villus increase crypt depth reduces edema intestinal endothelial cell indicates intervention coagulans mzy531 could alleviate intestinal mucosal injury induced cyp worth noting impairment intestinal mucosal barrier function seems main inducing factor intestinal mucosal injury therefore increasing intestinal barrier function seems good mean prevent treat intestinal injury intestinal tight junction protein zo-1 occludin claudin-1 important role maintaining intestinal barrier permeability constitute intestinal mucosal barrier intestinal epithelial cell according previous study coagulans scc-19 improves intestinal barrier carp induced heavy metal cadmium up-regulating mrna expression zo-1 occluding claudin-1 addition zhou confirmed ncu116 extracellular polysaccharide lactobacillus plantarum could increase expression zo-1 tight junction protein pathway promoting binding stat3 occludin zo-1 promoter thus repairing intestinal mechanical barrier function induced dextransodiumsulfate importantly study also found mzy531 activates expression zo-1 occluding claudin-1 protein thus restoring intestinal mucosal barrier function therefore speculate mzy531 may improve intestinal permeability activating expression intestinal tight junction protein thus resisting intestinal mucosal injury induced cyp recent year increasing evidence shown intestinal injury also induce intestinal leakage leaky gut causing bacteria metabolite translocate blood releasing inflammatory factor including tnf-α addition accumulation pro-inflammatory mediator break balance anti-inflammatory pro-inflammatory factor aggravate inflammatory cascade intestinal injury specific anti-inflammatory factor il-10 important role enhancing anti-inflammatory ability body reported probiotic reduce advocated inflammatory expression activating il-10-mediated immune pathway interestingly similar result obtained study therefore enhancing expression anti-inflammatory factor il-10 may one key controlling intestinal inflammation nevertheless study reported expression il-10 affected tlr4 pathway type transmembrane protein expressed cell membrane tlr4 important role regulating balance inflammation nf-κb pathway downstream signal transduction pathway dependent tlr4/myd88 pathway body normal homeostasis nf-κb bind i-κb remain static however external stimulation activate expression tlr4/myd88 pathway induce activation i-κb complex thus regulating expression target gene including tnf-α il-1β il-6 il-10 reported coagulans tl3 inhibits intestinal inflammation induced tlr4/myd88 suggests tlr4/myd88 signal pathway may signal transduction mechanism coagulans inhibiting intestinal inflammation expression addition scholar reported combined treatment several probiotic including coagulans suppresses dss-induced colitis up-regulating level il-10 interestingly reported e5564 antagonist tlr4 competitively bind tlr4-md2 inhibit activation downstream nf-κb promote release anti-inflammatory factor il-10 study found mzy531 down-regulates expression tlr4/myd88 pathway increase level il-10 suggests coagulans mzy531 may inhibitor tlr4 i.e. increase level il-10 intestine mouse inhibiting tlr4/myd88 pathway thus improving anti-inflammatory ability mouse finally improving intestinal inflammatory injury induced cyp coagulans regulate disorder intestinal microflora beneficial effect host study shown increased abundance diversity probiotic feces collected elderly taking coagulans gbi-30 day study also obtained consistent result found intervention coagulans mzy531 increase total number bacteria feces mouse intestinal injury induced cyp also indicates
