persistent emphasis generally yielded better health outcome time i.e. decreased all-cause cvd mortality rate even local level following release commission social determinant health report worldwide

continent suggested obvious pattern within-country geographical difference health including spain france germany similarly repeated cross-sectional study canada revealed worsening inequality self-reported health among employed unemployed citizen study asia provided similar finding several possible factor contributing geographical disparity taiwan finding indicate access primary care may one prominent series work professor barbara starfield highlighted positive impact health effect supply pcp reducing income-inequality health also case different geographical area taiwan facilitating

role preventing unforeseen accident injury unfortunately data mostly available township level observe however social gradient decline mortality i.e. largest drop mortality low economic development township followed middle high economic development area respectively improved access linked reduction mortality also noticed higher incidence mortality area greater access icu facility could attributed higher number critically ill patient receiving treatment area furthermore reduction all-cause death may serve contributing factor increased life expectancy period high economic development township exhibited lowest cvd mortality rate compared middle low development township however slight increase health indicator across township despite many high-income country experiencing significant reduction cvd death past decade taiwan like high-income nation witnessing slowdown rate decline trend attributed factor sedentary lifestyle increasing prevalence obesity diabetes hypertension 1980s 2000s taiwan experienced significant reduction cvd mortality nevertheless dietary shift among younger generation towards higher calorie intake sedentary lifestyle led health concern like overweight metabolic syndrome trend compounded aging population higher prevalence comorbidities collectively contribute rising cvd mortality rate study limitation consider impact specialist clinician due several

interest future investigation needed examine association closely lastly although period four year longitudinal analysis may seem extensive able demonstrate existing geographical variation health significant determinant period another longitudinal analysis may feasible updated comprehensive data becomes available near future since government release health inequality taiwan report led sir michael marmot team university college london certain level awareness raised health disparity among different social group possible underlying factor unfortunately appears issue health inequality still viewed lens 'health care rather approached broader scope like health policy hiap currently incentive recruit junior government-sponsored doctor work mountainous rural area integrated delivery
