phytoplankton productivity continuous accumulation organic matter lead eutrophication system series damaging ecological effect also harmful human harmful algal bloom habs often associated eutrophication coastal water estuary rapid increase population algae detrimental effect aquatic life triggered hypoxic water example phenomenon recently occurred mar menor coastal lagoon southeast
