aquaculture production help minimizing gap formed due food shortage caused overpopulation therefore quantity farmed fish marine freshwater farm expanded considerably last five decade last year world aquaculture yearly production increased average annual growth rate 6.7 one successful freshwater aquaculture candidate nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus cultivated several region world including china indonesia egypt top three producing country increasing output necessitates efficient use water resource achieved intensive aquaculture system however stressful environment cultivated animal intensified development spread bacterial infection freshwater body found reservoir aeromonas hydrophila may infect fish reptile amphibian bivalve human proven causative agent numerous disease outbreak
