patient exhibiting diverse health condition might considered personalized therapeutic approach within cardiac rehabilitation korea government established operated policy strengthen health insurance coverage since mitigate economic burden serious disease cancer heart disease cerebrovascular disease reducing out-of-pocket expenditure converting benefit non-benefit item program korea covered national health insurance since february participation rate among cardiac patient korea ranged 0.0 6.4 also low hospital actively delivering 14–35 studied data institution one largest provider korea participation rate 38.7 study worldwide 38.8 country program despite benefit recommendation clinical practice guideline grossly underused compared medical treatment patient cvd various study service providing system needed promote study limitation first retrospective study performed single-tertiary university hospital lacking external validity however study strength including patient group history high-risk group mace detailed long-term follow-up surveillance data analyzing detailed pci procedure status related incidence mace strengthen accuracy finding however study larger sample size longer follow-up period event needed validate finding conclusion among people diagnosed receiving pci patient participated within one month discharge reduced risk developing study reinforced current evidence effect among patient receiving pci presented expansion enhancement program
