focusing geographical area origin observe female central-western asia likely uptake vaccination male additional analysis showed comparable result limitation considered suppose different pattern vaccination uptake inside outside region migrant italian case observed association might biased accessed data lazio region rome mobility among migrant may higher among non-migrants would cause underestimate vaccination coverage bias observed hazard ratio toward lower bound nevertheless studied resident population resident migrant likely prone mobility non-resident migrant addition due pandemic restriction likely mobility reduced another limitation may related record-linkage procedure could efficient among migrant population italian would yield underestimation vaccination uptake among migrant concerning adjustment deprivation index based census data change social tissue occurred ten year might imply misclassification relation source confounding could adjust major factor age factor like comorbidities occupation marital status might also play role finally contextual factor changing time fluctuating mobility restriction risk infection policy oriented mandatory vaccination might directly indirectly affect association however interpretation model include calendar time cut-offs appropriate factor would complex decided adjust stratify calendar time present study result indicate vulnerability migrant residing rome concerning covid-19 vaccination access suggest inequality health lower vaccination uptake also observed italian study conducted lazio administrative region rome found foreign resident triple probability italian accessing vaccine study conducted local health authority rome furthermore lower vaccination coverage among foreigner also observed study conducted brescia province one dramatically hit covid-19 beginning pandemic interpret finding consider covid case among migrant might different characteristic affecting risk infection need vaccinated

individual also observed woman central-western asia showed lower vaccination coverage men area prevalent origin country subject living rome bangladesh india sri lanka pakistan subject male central-western asian woman typically come italy family reunification often unemployed social contact aspect may partly explain lower vaccination coverage among woman subgroup migrant various factor literature identified possible explanation low vaccine uptake hesitancy example delay acceptance refusal vaccine despite availability vaccination service among migrant systematic review exploring barrier facilitator vaccine uptake identified language literacy communication practical legal service barrier uptake vaccine country access barrier health service identified migrant barrier also played role vaccination uptake especially beginning vaccination campaign later october vaccine became mandatory people year occupied people possession green pas document certifying vaccination imposed work demonstrate full vaccination coverage according model vaccine hesitancy developed sage working group three main factor influence vaccine uptake confidence complacency convenience barrier recent systematic review performed synthetise qualitative study reason vaccine hesitancy among migrant author found confidence dimension model …people vaccine hesitant low confidence vaccine effectiveness safety distrust scientist policymakers health professionals… represents disproportionately large barrier vaccine uptake ethnic minority group argue confidence dimension may explain vaccine hesitancy among migrant italy communication vaccination campaign challenging due linguistic barrier different health literacy migrant compared italian despite communication strategy adopted country health literacy may associated vaccination although evidence scarce addition convenience dimension …people vaccine hesitant number barrier physical logistical economical hinder getting vaccine… may represented another important explanation vaccine hesitancy among migrant italy fact already documented migrant encounter italy european country various barrier accessing health service pandemic may represented critical issue covid-19 prevention addition argue since migrant italy often employed temporary precarious job intention vaccinated may undermined fear possible vaccine collateral effect limiting chance work ecdc suggests various approach strengthening vaccine uptake migrant may particularly relevant italy adopted provision …simple accurate culturally-relevant resource covid-19 vaccine range language literacy level formats… provision cultural mediator primary care addition availability data stratified origin country relevant factor gender socioeconomic status paramount relevance allows calculation immunisation indicator across subgroup population highlight unmet prevention need vulnerable group generalizability result although evaluation cover population living single city finding part indicative difference vaccination coverage italian migrant country study based vast city 2.7 million inhabitant whole population access vaccination offered resident italian non-italians without restriction italian region conclusion migrant residing rome italy showed lower uptake covid-19 vaccination first year vaccination campaign independently socioeconomic factor
