introduction although perianal abscess common purulent disease infant poorly understood clinical feature treatment different infant compared adult unfortunately infant seldom focused optimal management infant yet established traditionally incision drainage common treatment infant addition study suggested fistula identified laid open time primary drainage rate recurrence fistula formation may significantly reduced however noteworthy study shown infant time-limited self-limited disorder since found nonoperative management infant appears safe effective contrast study presented opposite view cured period conservation conservative treatment permanently efficient minority child thus conservative management infant remains controversial although conservative treatment recommended last two decade yet widely accepted far worthy note large number surgeon still favor incision drainage without primary fistulotomy addition literature conservative treatment infant currently scarce worse study single-center retrospective study relatively small sample size light limitation previous study additional study required ascertain reproducibility center nonoperative management infant child routinely performed previous study demonstrated neonate treated safely effectively fistulotomy nevertheless indeed observed patient experienced spontaneous drainage cured without surgery due parental refusal mentioned discussion despite surgical treatment recommended patient many parent refused surgery infant young therefore particularly interested know patient treated without surgery many patient would cured without surgery many patient would fail conservative treatment question may shed light natural course infant infant would cured largely without surgery infant time-limited disorder present real-world study aimed investigate natural course infant studying clinical outcome conservative treatment infant whose parent refused surgery material method setting patient retrospective review

supported infant may time-limited self-limited disease conservative management infant promising early surgical treatment avoided much possible surgical management routinely performed infant center subject study infant treated conservatively parent refused surgery best knowledge previous study investigated clinical outcome infant whose parent refused surgery new finding study result also showed longer period conservative treatment may achieve better clinical outcome selected case among patient failed initial conservative treatment underwent surgical treatment continued conservative treatment surprisingly among patient cured last patient developed fistula-in-ano observation due infrequent symptom therefore speculate conservative treatment continued relatively longer period failed initial conservative treatment selected case particularly surprising encouraging finding believed possibility self-resolution conducted work however expect overall cure rate conservative treatment would high doubt conservative treatment first choice infant case nonetheless recognized conservative treatment guarantee successful cure patient operative management reserved patient failed conservative treatment previous study suggested neonate treated safely effectively fistulotomy result appear contradict present study however need stated previous report based fact surgical management routinely performed infant child center mentioned discussion among patient spontaneous drainage cured spontaneously without surgery importance conservative treatment infant recognized since important emphasize although fistulotomy safe effective infant early surgical management avoided high cure rate conservative treatment since late 1990s study shown infancy time-limited disorder conservative treatment safe effective infant watanabe demonstrated infancy likely time-limited disorder occurs mainly infant almost always spontaneously resolve within first year life analyzed natural course child result showed infant cured without fistulotomy fistulectomy result highly consistent study later rosen performed prospective conservative approach male infant study drained infant uncomfortable febrile fistula developed continued observation fistula healed patient underwent discomfort fever remaining infant whose abscess drained spontaneously cured developed fistula-in-ano note patient fistula formation complete healing without operation based result suggested infant self-limited condition rarely requiring surgical drainage result largely consistent observation furthermore nonoperative management infant supported study last two decade however study reported different point view recommended surgical management infant retrospective study patient displayed onset symptom infancy duration symptom longer month failing nonoperative management underwent fistulotomy however one main limitation study patient treated conservatively enrolled mentioned discussion patient cured nonoperative management usually visit hospital lesion disappeared word study included patient failed conservative treatment thus study suffered obvious selection bias contrast study enrolled conservatively treated patient made result credible furthermore boenicke suggested conservative treatment permanently efficient minority child main limitation study conservative treatment duration short week demonstrate efficacy infant may spontaneously resolve within first year life conservative treatment lasted longer patient may better outcome present study better understand natural course infant patient treated conservatively month included suggest infant receive sufficient conservative treatment resorting surgical intervention additionally study showed conservative treatment patient developed new-onset abscess rate new-onset abscess 6.5 10/153 surprisingly exactly previous study showed 6.5 9/138 neonatal patient developed new abscess surgery new-onset abscess unique child compared adult several strength present study first natural course infant rarely reported literature extremely interesting valuable topic result shed light important question second real-world study reflected real clinical condition third sample size study large infant fourth follow-up period long median 5.3 year limitation study need recognized first single-center retrospective study limiting generalizability finding second conservative treatment approach uniform third lack photograph showing healing process due retrospective nature fourth risk factor failure conservative treatment identified low proportion patient undergoing surgery considering limitation sample size need expanded future fifth timing surgery identified study addressed future study last least study 80.2 universe patient original series excluded due early surgical treatment resulted selection bias actually patient treated conservatively parent refused surgery due small abscess size indeed size abscess large patient 43.8 moreover currently conducting prospective study conservative treatment infant study vast majority patient treated conservatively reduce potential selection bias despite limitation present study important clinical implication self-limiting nature change treatment paradigm infant early surgical intervention main treatment infant hospital currently nonoperative management first choice treatment infant believe result make pediatric surgeon worldwide recognize importance nonoperative treatment avoidance expense general anesthesia surgical intervention advantage nonoperative management paradigm shift management infant operative conservative approach undoubtedly significant implication especially era minimally invasive surgery despite promising result conservative treatment received much attention pediatric surgeon still favor operative management addition many question remain drug administered conservative treatment whether antibiotic used iii risk factor failure conservative treatment develop predictive model failure conservative treatment infant optimal timing surgery best surgical approach large-scale prospective study necessary address question conclusion conservative management seems promising first choice treatment case longer period conservative treatment may achieve better clinical outcome selected case early surgical management infant avoided much possible percentage patient would require surgical treatment
