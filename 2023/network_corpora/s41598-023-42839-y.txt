vzv infection involved development primary vzv also known human herpesvirus ubiquitous alphaherpesvirus double-stranded dna genome vzv infection common general population previous study shown incidence range case per person per year global age‐standardized incidence vzv infection continued increase past decade moreover vzv infection highly communicable spread air-borne route extraordinarily high transmission rate fortunately antiviral drug vaccine vzv available effective treating preventing vzv-induced disease therefore result indicated prevention vzv infection administering vaccine might decrease risk developing primary however considering vzv common primary pretty rare factor immune response difference individual also noted need investigation several advantage current study firstly used snp strongly associated exposure chickenpox shingle valid calculate causal association exposure outcome primary therefore ensures direction causal effect avoid reverse causation secondly test horizontal pleiotropy ensure causal association exposure outcome without effect confounding factor thirdly applied chickenpox shingle phenotype represent vzv infection confirmed robustness finding however limitation acknowledged current study first used analyzing causal effect chickenpox primary iv-based heritability could explain small proportion variance statistical power assessing causality chickenpox primary slightly low 0.72 therefore gwass larger sample size would helpful secondly chickenpox shingle case determined self-reported history without confirmation laboratory test result might bias gwas result therefore gwas conducted among laboratory-confirmed vzv infection case needed thirdly datasets used current study derived european population study ethnic group needed confirm result last least underlying mechanism mediating causal association vzv infection primary investigated functional study needed conclusion conclusion finding using gwas summary statistic provided novel genetic evidence indicating causal effect vzv infection primary therefore prevention vzv infection administering vaccine might decrease risk developing primary study needed elucidate underlying mechanism mediating causal association
