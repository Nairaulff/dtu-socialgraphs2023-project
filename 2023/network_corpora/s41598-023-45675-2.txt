prime target disease however non-motor region also involved including frontotemporal lobe illness progress weakness usually result loss function limb difficulty walking speaking eventually breathing median survival following onset symptom 2–5 year respiratory failure commonly reason death however interval onset symptom death range month ten year range make impossible clinician effectively counsel patient advance care planning select patient specific survival characteristic drug trial clinician often employ pharmacologic treatment e.g. riluzole edaravone amx0035 early stage disease slow disease
