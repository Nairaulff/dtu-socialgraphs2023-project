introduction progress towards vision malaria-free world recently stalled goal global technical strategy gts malaria track indeed expected reduction least malaria mortality morbidity compared level achieved reverse trend novel innovative intervention needed may include safe effective vaccine drug product potential interrupting malaria transmission ultimately achieve elimination however vaccine drug product development lengthy complex process requiring substantial resource time example timeframe vaccine development year cost usd200 million usd900 million overall probability success approximately controlled human malaria infection chmi study consist deliberate infection healthy volunteer malaria parasite either mosquito bite direct injection sporozoite parasitized erythrocyte well-controlled proof concept study allow understand development immune response malaria infection rapidly screen potential vaccine drug candidate substantially smaller ten participant shorter completed week expensive large clinical trial allow selection candidate vaccine drug product worthy investigation larger field trial unlike large field trial chmi enables investigator entirely control exposure malaria parasite term strain dose thus chmi study valuable tool accelerate vaccine drug product development since first well-documented chmi laboratory-reared infectious mosquito carried walter reed army institute research wrair number chmi study increased united state europe increasingly conducted malaria-endemic country including sub-sahara africa population difference related naturally acquired immunity genetics nutrition etc. important conduct chmi study malaria-endemic country rather northern malaria-naïve country allow early assessment vaccine drug efficacy population pre-existing malaria immunity conducting chmi study also important building capacity infrastructure research institution endemic country enables african researcher become involved earlier stage vaccine drug development however deliberate infection healthy volunteer malaria parasite violates fundamental principle medicine primum non nocere first harm raise multiple ethical concern chmi study volunteer little direct benefit participation instead chmi study aim advancing scientific knowledge public health gain selecting specific category volunteer area raise concern relatively privileged population may primary beneficiary research conducted underprivileged population time commitment discomfort infected study procedure burdensome addition volunteer often confined prevent engaging daily activity close monitoring prevent inadvertent transmission third-party financial payment compensating time lost may lead undue inducement especially population low socio-economic status therefore careful rigorous ethical review vital ensure safety volunteer maximizing scientific gain addition ethical concern crucial understand perception acceptability chmi study community done key success

well long term well-established expertise mrcg lshtm longstanding relationship local community given nature chmi namely infection healthy volunteer malaria implementation would extremely difficult impossible without trust local community implementing institution despite positive perception attitude concern study procedure expressed mainly related frequency volume blood sampling surprising similar concern usually expressed study intense blood sampling schedule kenya chmi volunteer also concerned blood sampling found burdensome collecting blood sample individual recruited clinical research project sub-saharan africa challenging often related rumour blood stealing blood selling rumour represent social diagnosis logical attempt make sense clinical trial today world countered communicating research participant culturally appropriate way addressing concern chmi volunteer received exhaustive explanation study procedure none expressed fear improper use blood sample collected nevertheless probably underestimated inconvenience related daily visit blood draw confinement happened also kenya usa chmi study complex logistically challenging generally thought recruiting study participant higher level education would facilitate informed consent process participant would better position understand study aim procedure uneducated one reason chmi study included volunteer least

procedure reason level payment gambia member ethic committee indicated level compensation fair extensive discussion study received ethical approval however young respondent wider community suggested chmi volunteer compensated larger amount given level burden raising question determine acceptable amount adequate payment remains subject debate difficult reach consensus among various stakeholder dickert grady recommend adoption wage payment model payment based solely standard wage payment unskilled labour additional payment made uncomfortable procedure model reduces undue inducement concern standardizes payment schedule establishes system payment based contribution subject make consistent principle equal pay equal work lynch colleague suggest payment volunteer either form compensation time research-related burden inconvenience reimbursement reimbursement out-of-pocket expense incentive mean encourage recruitment retention although different view expressed regarding payment finding indicate ethic committee member favor combination compensation reimbursement method finding study indicate chmi study acceptable gambian community similar result found kenya may suggest chmi study would acceptable community part sub-saharan africa region highest burden malaria however despite acceptance challenge study community engagement may differ one country another community engagement determined locally based appropriate program mutual trust community research institution willingness community take chmi study conducting study malaria endemic area offer several benefit including building reinforcing local capacity term scientific expertise clinical facility laboratory diagnostic governance regulatory offer opportunity accelerate streamlining development vaccine treatment relevant sub-saharan africa limitation method selection respondent using professional network mrcg lshtm fieldworker may resulted selection bias however minimize ensured respondent varied term age

community justifies conduct malaria endemic country gambia weighing potential benefit burden associated chmi study requires careful rigorous ethical scientific review study protocol also consider local community perception acceptability finding study indicate chmi study acceptable gambian community greatly influenced longstanding trust relationship local community mrcg lshtm nonetheless
