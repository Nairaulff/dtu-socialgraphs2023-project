76.3 billion rate visit elderly people aged year older visit per person higher group overall visit per person except infant age year visit per infant multiple comorbidities polypharmacy older adult increase risk medication-related visit jeon identified risk hospitalization visit older patient found taking one general potentially inappropriate medication pims based beer criterion twofold increased risk visit taking pims study patient visited u.s. found approximately 6.1 visit per people per year due medication addition 38.6 drug-related visit required follow-up hospitalization hospitalization rate aged year 48.9 visit related medication use elderly people significantly higher age group therefore countermeasure needed one possible approach reduce number visit older patient identify patient likely require visit proactively adjust modifiable factor medication use several study conducted predict risk requiring visit one study conducted u.s. using electronic administrative
