introduction obsessive–compulsive disorder ocd affect approximately general population fourth common mental disorder depression alcohol/substance use disorder social phobia ocd characterized presence obsession compulsion obsession recurrent intrusive thought urge image patient try ignore suppress commonly present fear contamination losing control harm sexual fear religious fear perfectionism subsequently compulsion occur prevent reduce anxiety discomfort caused obsession may present repetitive behavior e.g. washing cleaning checking ordering mental act e.g. praying counting ocd cause significant functional impairment lead income loss decreased quality life world health organization list one ten disabling condition ssri fluoxetine fluvoxamine paroxetine sertraline sri clomipramine first-line fda-approved medication treatment ocd however 40–60 case treatment-refractory achieving adequate symptom relief first-line treatment highlight importance second-line adjuvant therapy exact

5-ht3 receptor ionotropic 5-ht receptor primarily localized limbic structure e.g. amygdala hippocampus nucleus accumbens striatum low density 5-ht3 receptor exists cortex 5-ht3 stimulation enhances dopaminergic activity release serotonin norepinephrine acetylcholine selective serotonin receptor 5-ht3 antagonist block serotonin peripherally vagal nerve terminal gastrointestinal system centrally chemoreceptor trigger zone hindbrain particular dorsal motor nucleus vagus nerve nucleus tractus solitary area postrema fourth ventricle resulting powerful antiemetic effect substantial sedative effect minimizing risk abuse dependence tolerance withdrawal addition ssri commonly produce digestive side effect nausea vomiting diarrhea decreased appetite side effect determined increase serotonin
