support vaccine efficiency pertussis vaccination copd patient contrast previous influenza vaccination study demonstrated impaired humoral cellular response influenza vaccination several hypothesis may explain discrepancy difference vaccine design adjuvant composition possible specific case influenza re-exposure original exposure preferentially boost immune response original strain dictated original exposure shaped cell repertoire hypothesis designated original antigenic sin oas indeed reported seasonal influenza vaccine observation influenza strain encountered later life boosted humoral response original strain subtype however case tdap vaccination pertussis several factor may contribute different immune response pattern firstly decreased incidence pertussis infection due successful vaccination program resulted lower overall exposure pertussis antigen furthermore tdap vaccination schedule typically involves fewer dos potentially reducing opportunity immune priming subsequent original antigenic sin effect study limitation monocentric prospective exploratory study limited number included patient conclusion regarding immunological clinical impact pertussis vaccination copd
