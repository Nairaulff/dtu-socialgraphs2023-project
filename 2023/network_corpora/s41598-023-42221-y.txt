finding previous study kim found although soil general contained three bacterial clade burkholderiaceae south korea pedestris harbored single clade reared field-collected soil riptortus pedestris constricted region midgut narrow passage filled mucus-like matrix known sort specific bacteria sorting organ serf important barrier prevent influx non-symbiotic pathogenic microbe environmental acquisition symbiotic bacteria pedestris soil indeed soil typically contains highly diverse bacterial complex even small spatial scale example 3.8 specie one-gram soil addition sorting mechanism interspecific competition bacterial specie likely affect specie would eventually colonize midgut crypt pedestris single bacterial specie insecticola dominantly established midgut pedestris insect co-inoculated two bacterial specie belonging different genus laboratory condition along internal mechanism described inevitably soil microbiota would serve fundamental basis determining symbiotic bacterial community pedestris therefore essential characterize soil microbiota better understand ecological association bacterial community soil insect however study provides limited information soil bacterial community diagnostic pcr analysis conducted soil sample nonetheless result confirm presence target bacterial genus detected pedestris soil sample analyzed addition basic validation continuous research need include comparative analysis soil insect bacterial community study insect reared field-collected soil total bacterial specie burkholderiaceae found midgut pedestris therefore constricted region selective toward symbiotic bacteria still allows entry diverse specie burkholderiaceae midgut region pedestris among bacteria detected four specie insecticola megalochromosomata cordobensis udeis previously documented association pedestris particular study report first time jiangsuensis dominant specie established midgut pedestris moreover current research also evaluated symbiotic effect jiangsuensis insect symbiotic bacteria significantly enhanced development growth reproductive potential pedestris compared insect symbiotic bacteria addition caballeronia spp. recent finding also demonstrated symbiotic effect paraburkholderia fungorum pandoraea norimbergenesis pedestris therefore continuous effort needed investigate bacterial complex establishing symbiosis pedestris association insect interpreting symbiotic bacterial diversity reported study recommended consider following two aspect first culture-dependent method used characterize bacterial specie diversity pedestris thus rule possibility approach might underestimated bacterial diversity culture condition suitable bacteria specie requiring specific environment addition even culture condition study optimal symbiotic bacteria still taking three colony per insect might sufficient represent bacterial specie diversity pedestris second symbiotic bacteria identified based taxonomic assignment using similarity-based search rrna gene methodology entail ambiguity specie identification including lack gene sequence similarity matched type strain indeed include data set insect symbiotic bacterial diversity analysis due limitation specie identification addition approach distinguish insecticola peredens among bacteria specie detected nonetheless also noteworthy insecticola well known symbiotic association pedestris whereas record exists peredens future study culture-independent method analysis need employed obtain comprehensive high-throughput sequencing data thereby alleviating limitation current study interestingly jiangsuensis known degrade organophosphate insecticide methyl parathion soil collected jiangsu province china although methyl parathion longer available many country symbiosis jiangsuensis may important implication pest management regard development insecticide resistance pedestris kikuchi demonstrated symbiotic association bacterial strain degrade fenitrothion soil could also confer insecticide resistance pedestris continuous application synthetic insecticide could make insecticide-degrading bacteria abundant soil may turn facilitate symbiosis pedestris conferring insect insecticide resistance therefore worthwhile evaluate whether symbiosis jiangsuensis might confer insecticide resistance pedestris especially organophosphate addition second
