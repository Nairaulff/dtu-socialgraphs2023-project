introduction imagine bos sends fake news article social medium meet ask article would openly agree bos would think bos situation suggest reaction situation would depend perception bos autonomous bos truly listens value input want improve suggest confidence permission disagree explain rationale article fake paternalistic bos care sometimes listens doe pay much attention suggest space respectfully disagree e.g. agree disagree agree avoid conflict job would risk authoritarian bos doe care idea doe value input want compliance however suggest feel strong social pressure agree fake news people agree even know full well fake disagree lose job although past research primarily focused cognitive motivational mechanism people fail reject misinformation suggest social force everyday life large understudied source people agree fake news examine leadership style superior key social factor explains people agree fake news past research mostly found different mechanism people may use distinguish real fake news cognitive processing analytic thinking digital literacy motivational partisanship explanation factor matter trying understand people distinguish real fake news explain people develop individual skill identify fake news suggest however social factor least important people agreement fake news specifically people often concerned accurate distinguishing real fake news concerned agreeing important people control life situation cognitive motivational demographic factor important truly matter argue whether agree power know wield suggest least three form social influence powerfully create agreement fake news wielded authoritarian bos pressure conform obedience authority expected real-life negative consequence e.g. punishment higher magnitude three factor people would conform believing misinformation classic asch study conformity large number people conform judgment know wrong faced unanimous majority demonstrating pressure conform lead people agreement stanley milgram demonstrated authoritarian leader ramp acquiescence decision people know wrong powerful finding occurred even people knew authoritarian leader control important part life much authoritarian leader punish people way important create agreement errant view suggest powerful force conformity obedience fear punishment work together cause people agree authoritarian leader even know information promoting inaccurate wrong people agree fake news authoritarian leader promotes information past research alluded different leadership style closely aligned leadership prototype lewin colleague conceptualized different leadership style autocratic democratic laissez-faire autocratic leader similar conceptualize authoritarian leader democratic leader autonomous leader although research provided insight prototype development research build upon conceptualization organizing leadership style key underlying factor control article conceptualizing control one person actually influencing another person behave certain way authoritarian leader would highly controlling followed paternalistic leader autonomous leader would low control higher control leader immediate social influence would subordinate thus expect authoritarian leader would influence subordinate agree fake news past research also demonstrated importance leadership characteristic besides dimension control example leader vary extent competent warm also vary extent relationship- task-oriented also vary extent would want transform culture i.e. transformational leadership demonstrate unique contribution leadership prototype measure included relevant leadership characteristic study controlled robustness check analysis see supplemental material present study aimed explore relevance novel leadership prototype accuracy agreeing fake news multinational context recruited prolific worker either part-time full-time job asked categorize immediate superior one three different leadership prototype characterize along relevant leadership dimension subsequently reported accuracy several fake news article expectation agree superior asked aimed extend misinformation leadership literature demonstrating social force authoritarian leader related people belief fake news people paternalistic autonomous leader thus people may agree fake news inability cognitively discern real fake news also conforming power

stronger example situation people come rely authoritarian figure sole source true false would expect large effect authoritarian figure accuracy agreement fake news study however several important limitation first sample across different country representative population know whether would find similar trend representative sample second know whether finding would generalize culture authoritarian leader widely present plausible however would find even stronger effect studying culture authoritarian regime third ask participant level education may affect extent would believe misinformation although asked parent guardian level education socioeconomic indicator controlled variable affect result see detail analysis fourth although present study first explore relation type leader tendency subordinate agree fake news data correlational thus address causal claim perhaps people tend agree fake news seek authoritarian paternalistic boss also rule third variable may cause people become authoritarian paternalistic bos causing subordinate likely agree fake news another limitation leadership task ass perception leader perception may biased multiple reason i.e. participant upbringing socialization example people raised authoritarian parent and/or may socialized authoritarian superior may assume important treat superior reverence respect therefore may expect obey authority even autonomous leader superior position despite correlational nature data believe provides compelling account accuracy agreement fake news deserves exploration research considerable number theoretical practical implication theoretically research highlight potential importance social influence agreement misinformation demonstrating people may fail reject misinformation able distinguish real fake news may agree fake news pressure situation order conform authoritarian leader want believe addition developed novel leadership measure based common prototype leader demonstrated measure could predict whether people agree misinformation reasoning correct leader exert power subordinate subordinate agree fake news even know untrue social influence likely create pluralistic ignorance skepticism misinformation people acquiesce desire leader people may know leader saying wrong think one think way research also many practical implication fight misinformation need understand make people literate better able discern real fake news cognitive motivational demographic explanation suggest also need teach people resist social influence perhaps puncture pluralistic ignorance prior educational intervention nudged people vigilant consume news informed prepared participant various way misinformed inoculation targeted medium literacy skill development people understand news fake however agree nonetheless social pressure none intervention effective situation sharpening cognitive digital skill useful wise strategy fight conformity pressure reject fake news perspective need implement strategy could help people find others help withstand social influence bos instance know single ally dramatically reduce conformity asch line judgment study know several participant milgram study decided shock level together one argued resist experimenter much likely obey authority figure lesson suggest people feel need agree powerful bos resist social pressure turning others seeking support dealing powerful bos wields power may much important curate ally resist fake news recognize fake present work open door wide variety future research example future study might examine norm around publicly accepting fake news emerge different leadership style future study may also examine psychometrically consolidated measure leadership style move beyond present relatively simple prototype leadership measure furthermore present work cross-sectional using experimental method examine causality future study may overcome shortcoming systematically manipulating leadership style examining may impact belief misinformation also intervention may constructed promote autonomous leadership decrease belief misinformation addition future research may differentiate public acceptance vs. private belief misinformation current study ass expectation agree misinformation know whether participant factually believing fake news article private belief complying request superior public acceptance another future direction could recruit participant different society western democracy present study pattern result may vary depending whether participant come eastern western society individualistic interdependent culture authoritarian democratic regime combination different factor another potential direction would move beyond leadership organization use theoretical framework politics future research also focus political leader influence accepting fake news context recent pandemic importantly current finding derive hypothetical scenario participant imagined bos approaching asking fake news article situation imagined tenet social psychology fundamental attribution error whereby people underestimate power situation overestimate power disposition example people think would obey authority figure milgram study yet know people although effect report quite large suspect real-life situation bos power fire subordinate social influence bos may even stronger imagined vignette study power situation may underestimated specifically suspect people authoritarian bos even likely express disagreement fake news promulgated bos real life study conclusion find people imagine asked controlling authoritarian bos agree headline fake express much agreement misinformation asked agree news autonomous bos finding suggest power social situation may play much important role agreement misinformation individual difference cognitive capacity examined previously therefore slight change focus measure term accuracy agreement misinformation consideration leadership style highlight role social psychological factor discernment compliance misinformation
