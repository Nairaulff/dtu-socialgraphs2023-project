suggests may earlier marker overweight/obesity hypertension prediction compensatory hyperinsulinemia contribute pathophysiology hypertension multifactorial manner shown related increased peripheral arterial resistance greater arterial stiffness moreover study indicate insulin peripheral vasodilator effect stimulating production endothelial nitric oxide reducing intracellular concentration calcium muscle cell arterial wall therefore individual resistance action insulin would vasodilator action hormone moreover insulin may anti-natriuretic action distal renal tubule increase activation renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system consequently individual compensatory hyperinsulinemia context may exacerbation effect would lead greater vasoconstriction increased total circulating plasma volume important pathophysiology hypertension study also innovates evaluating impact prehypertension hypertension people without diabetes latin america another differential study large number individual
