overseas immunocompromised debilitated patient shigellosis among relative food poisoning community cause diarrhea explored hypothesis viral infection often retained without microbiological proof however accurate identification enteric pathogen could influence therapeutic decision particular concerning relevance antibiotic help improve infectious diarrhea management health care setting another major advantage pathogen identification possibility identifying source contamination therefore potentially preventing transmission limiting epidemic phenomenon would therefore interesting able predict causative pathogen child presenting diarrhea although identify specific symptom history biological abnormality associated specific pathogen four patient profile emerged study group appear bring

show effect pandemic occurrence infectious diarrhea child french confinement partial return community also widespread introduction barrier measure limitation travel child spared etiology responsible diarrhea time thus study allows identify mainly indigenous diarrhea secondly also selection bias included stool collected emergency department excluding child stool coming thus child relatively stool
