introduction non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nafld result accumulation fat liver tissue one leading cause chronic liver disease developed society meta‐analysis study showed prevalence nafld among adult population world also showed prevalence disease middle east —that significant percentage case suffering medical condition part world obesity type diabetes dyslipidemia metabolic syndrome approved risk factor nafld metabolic syndrome considered among factor particular concern researcher nafld regarded important hepatic manifestation syndrome according many recent study dietary pattern risk factor nafld different type dietary pattern rich fat diet may lead fatty liver disease diet containing large amount sugar may also contribute early stage nafld child evidenced study association carbohydrate-based diet nafld increase consumption vegetable legume fruit associated likely reduction development disease researcher merely focused effect dietary pattern contrast others regarded various food group risk factor nafld instance odds nafld decreased lebanese traditional diet following healthy dietary pattern also based study mediterranean dietary pattern example decrease likeliness nafld dietary pattern dietary pattern made three main component defined variety quantity combination different food item beverage diet conventional study often focused variety quantity component without taking consideration combination example contrast many valuable report quantity tea coffee consumption report given co-consumption tea coffee without providing information co-consumption give information percentage people consume tea coffee furthermore case food group study focused co-consumption none study examined co-consumption food item risk factor disease especially nafld iqbal first one employed network representation method describe dietary pattern used proposed network named intake network analyze dietary pattern adult population living germany concluded meat played major role dietary pattern extend definition disease-related intake network present study co-consumption defined pairwise correlation quantity two food item eaten together method entitled co-consumption network ccn introduced measure co-consumption two food group network detailed various previously developed network analysis method field social science typical network
