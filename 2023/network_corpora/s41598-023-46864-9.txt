introduction covid-19 pandemic associated policy response rapidly evolved across world people adapt multiple way whether adopting preventative measure mask testing understanding symptom risk treatment option adapting lifestyle social distancing measure dealing business closure unemployment people throughout world continuously learning adapt pandemic one first place people turn learn coronavirus symptom new policy vaccine online google search google hold search engine market share coronavirus commonly searched term google search generate vast amount publicly available information people symptom fear concern demand information real-time data high value policymakers aim better understand monitor react citizen experience google search pattern provide crucial information time source traditional household survey costly feasible due infection risk additionally google search data always up-to-date making particularly useful real-time decision-making previous research shown potential google search interest inform different stage pandemic including anticipating rising covid-19 case understanding potential consequence containment policy however study focused either single limited

considering limited resource developing country often monitor spread pandemic opportunity generated google search data particularly promising country second find internet search valuable tool understand effect covid-19 shutdown policies—such school closure stay-at-home requirement travel restrictions—across world pooling together country available data using difference-in-differences

search interest data available real-time data could used future crisis understand impact crisis policy response occur—indicating search interest data could tool informing policy response additionally find notable heterogeneity association containment policy change search interest across different level economic support mobility restriction find country restrictive containment policy saw higher search interest many mental health keywords unemployment reduction search interest select relationship family planning keywords overall result suggest country restrictive policy experienced pronounced economic mental health social externality analysis relies country-level data however google also enables querying subnational search interest data extending analysis global subnational level would informative many country experienced heterogeneity covid-19 rate response covid-19 focus country-level data data covid-19 case social economic outcome readily available country level however policymakers practitioner may find useful track key google trend indicator subnational level relying google search interest come set limitation example search interest driven global news event rather country-specific dynamic search interest serf imperfect—albeit often strong—proxy on-the-ground condition however key advantage search interest data free immediately accessible real-time moreover result emphasize google search data help monitor spread consequence pandemic even low-resource setting providing insight across multiple phase pandemic result demonstrate potential using widespread expansion technology better understand address pressing real-time issue affect citizen throughout entire world method section first describe google search interest data used throughout paper describe data methodology used two set analysis search interest correlating preceding case association containment policy search interest indicator google search interest data google search interest data queried using gtrendsr package period september december daily level query data across country search term related covid-19 symptom possible social mental health economic consequence pandemic appendix provides list search term number country data term country use translated version search term using language highest search activity google determine language highest search activity comparing search interest fever doctor hospital food restaurant football across widely used language country translation done using google translate api appendix detail specific step used determine language highest search activity country alternative approach could consider multiple language instead language highest search activity use one language country two reason first language highest search activity typically notably higher search activity language second highest search activity across country two language considered language highest search activity popular language second highest search activity country consequently querying search interest across multiple language taking weighted average based popularity language would minimally change result second querying google trend across multiple language would significantly increase number query would need made google trend google trend limit number call made specific time period increasing number query would notably increase computation time global analysis search interest information google reflects absolute number search keyword phrase relative total number search specific geographic area period time consequently search interest indicator reflects relative popularity keyword opposed absolute number search google scale search interest value maximum value given query e.g. search interest loss smell united state scaled maximum value google provides search interest value sufficient search activity consequently search interest value zero indicates could search interest search term sufficient data one challenge using google trend google provides daily value search interest day queried given google scale value query raw search interest value comparable across query different date range create consistent time series querying search interest across time period overlap then—relying search interest overlapping time periods—scale data set create consistent time series see appendix additional detail use separate query country search term consequently search interest data query comparable across time within specific country keyword second challenge using google trend given time interval google trend data based random subsample drawn google variation google trend data resulting sampling large case small countries/regions keywords low search volume eichenauer developed solution problem relies drawing multiple random sample google trend data leveraging approach would lead best quality google trend data however approach requires notably higher number query google trend given google limit number query made specific time interval using approach difficult context query keywords countries—making computational burden using approach non-trivial consequently approach using google trend doe account random sampling variation sampling variation likely add noise data suggests result serve lower bound relation google trend outcome accounting sampling variation—and reducing noise data—would likely improve result e.g. association covid-19 reported search interest google search interest correlating anticipating covid-19 case first set analysis seek understand search term correlate covid-19 case whether trend search interest precede trend case daily covid-19 case data come world health organization analysis focus keywords relating coronavirus generally coronavirus covid-19 treat coronavirus symptom common covid-19 loss taste loss smell smell taste general symptom associated disease fever cough tired pneumonia country keyword compute correlation coefficient search interest case understand search

search interest case using lead lag value case day day lead/lag follows search interest correlating strongly lagged case would suggest search interest pick trend pattern reflected official data search interest correlating strongly lead positive shift case would suggest search interest reacts on-the-ground condition advanced model could considered estimate predict reported covid-19 case example google flu trends—developed early detection influenza—considered million search query study used google flu trend data time-series model enhance influenza prediction however leverage correlation analysis two reason first aligns similar literature analyzes association google search interest reported covid-19 case second correlation analysis relies single search term opposed index mimic type data policymaker practitioner would able readily retrieve google trend website google trend website make easy see recent trend individual search term consequently correlation analysis relatively simple showing search term correlated covid-19 case could help inform policymakers practitioner search term track google trend website implement formal predictive model understanding certain search term tends correlated covid-19 cases—and seeing sustained increase search activity search term—could still provide useful insight policymaker practitioner suggesting covid-19 case may increasing
