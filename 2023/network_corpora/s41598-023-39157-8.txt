introduction schistosomiasis chronic parasitic disease caused trematode blood fluke genus schistosoma water snail serving intermediate host transmission reported country majority classified low- middle-income country according report million people risk infection major form schistosomiasis—intestinal due schistosoma mansoni japonicum urogenital predominantly due haematobium common sign symptom urogenital schistosoma haematobium include swollen belly blood urine stunted growth cognitive impairment child infertility among adult childbearing age advanced disease may sometimes present fibrosis bladder ureter kidney damage bladder cancer diagnosis normally done detection parasite egg urine stool specimen using microscopy manual microscopy world health organization reference diagnostic method diagnosis haematobium infection parasite-derived product including egg stool urine identified egg quantified egg count indicates intensity infection patient also reflect exposure
