conversely study shown plhiv equivalent risk covid-19 compared general population vietnam plhiv population may cautious sars-cov-2 infection given health status easily receive information advice preventing sars-cov-2 infection regular hospital visit furthermore measure vietnamese government protect plhiv sars-cov-2 infection ensuring priority access vaccine might contributed preventing
