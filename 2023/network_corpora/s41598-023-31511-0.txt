introduction pocket park landscape pocket park small-scale urban open space dotted throughout high-density urban area generally area pocket park larger pocket park usually adapted leftover space city example paley park constructed robert zernmarshall space high-rise building compared large-scale park greenbelt pocket park small scale widely distributed meet demand urban resident daily contact nature sense pocket park endowed ecological social landscape function pocket park landscape usually composed paved site seat arbour fitting facility plant landscape waterscape china entered ageing society elderly people become important group society large park far away due physiological reason pocket park become important place leisure activity elderly people good pocket park landscape great help elderly people rest enjoy beautiful scenery promote physical mental recovery pocket park sustain capability elderly people live independently participate social interaction many scholar conducted research pocket park pocket park landscape roy observed elderly people aged frequent visitor pocket park age group kerishnan found people partner inclined visit pocket park nordh conducted related study showed pocket park landscape could improve mental recovery amp tynonsupa/sup concluded pocket park landscape better afforestation encouraged people use outdoor space thus promoted social interaction however study pocket park landscape especially greening still rare visual impact assessment visual impact assessment widely used method assessing impact various landscape element human

among demographic characteristic elderly people landscape feature pocket park neglected pocket park landscape composed various element afforestation leisure facility water landscape element may directly influence visual impact assessment elderly individual afforestation pocket park influence people visual impact assessment study conducted sarah indicated tall tree could offer shade urban green space landscape would positively attract elderly people perform physical exercise park turn would render higher visual impact assessment elderly individual number colour diversity pocket park landscape also enhance beauty improve quality whole landscape generates desirable visual impact assessment among respondent ying observed general highly layered plant community win approval respondent addition hard landscape park green space large effect people mental recovery elderly people likely walk hard paved square green space ratio relatively low however due decline physiological function elderly people prefer soft ground lawn green space ratio high leisure facility also influence people visual impact assessment kaczynski claimed seat provided park satisfy people demand social gathering interaction according australian study elderly people prefer park seat cohen proposed installation fitting facility could also increase attraction park abdelhamid elfakharany maintained shading device could reduce air temperature improve comfort level summer thus creating comfortable park environment elderly individual similarly shading device may make elderly people likely willing take walk installation leisure facility exerts positive influence choice elderly people line investigation conducted abdelhamid elfakharany water landscape also influential people visual impact assessment element high ecological value water activate space make landscape park amiable william whyte american sociologist maintained water key element popular urban space masoudi claimed water could mitigate urban heat island effect demonstrated many study water landscape psychologically restorative landscape water also considered key landscape attribute stimulate recovery elderly people elderly people feel annoyed traffic noise sound water emitted waterscape facility effectively reduce noise interference hamia found water landscape preferred type landscape especially hot summer elderly people prefer visit pocket park water landscape facility linger around based classification elderly people demographic characteristic six landscape feature summarized consideration influence

visual preference evaluation set picture among elderly individual including gender living arrangement type revealed study compared elderly men elderly woman provided lower visual assessment specifically mean score female respondent 3.5 mean score male respondent 3.28 although yao maintained gender influence visual impact assessment landscape result obtained study contrary finding study gender difference led different visual impact assessment landscape basically consistent conclusion richardson mitchell result explained theory evolutionary stasis long history evolution woman shown strong interest plant rich colour may related fact woman often play role food picker colourful plant usually rich vitamin mineral nutrient important woman produce healthy offspring however colourful plant landscape common urban green space pocket park partly explains older woman lower score pocket park landscape older men previous study suggested age important factor affect elderly respondent visual impact assessment example berg koole found age negatively correlated visual impact assessment study visual impact assessment water landscape howley observed age positively correlated visual impact assessment study traditional farm landscape however result study indicated age significant factor influenced elderly people visual impact assessment pocket park landscape previous study physical characteristic age group differed greatly whereas research object study elderly individual divided three age group namely 60–69 year old 70–79 year old year old physical characteristic similar drastically different similar need pocket park landscape shared common standard visual impact assessment landscape svobodova wang maintained education level significantly influence people visual impact assessment example highly educated respondent prefer natural vegetation closely associated ecological interest however result study contrary finding study found influence education level elderly respondent visual impact assessment pocket park landscape significant remarkable difference observed group different education level line conclusion molnarova zhen study found residential type exerted impact elderly people visual impact assessment pocket park landscape overall elderly people lived alone provided lower score living family specifically average score elderly people lived alone 3.08 whereas average score lived family 3.17 difference may justified fact elderly individual live alone greater ability take care compared live family sensitive observant surroundings accordingly may higher expectation pocket park landscape actual landscape meet expectation may likely provide lower score overall consensus reached regarding influence elderly individual gender age educational level residential type visual impact assessment therefore effort must made explore influence elderly people demographic characteristic visual impact assessment pocket park landscape interaction different demographic characteristic main reason still definite conclusion influence demographic characteristic visual impact assessment landscape environment interaction demographic characteristic variable date concrete conclusion working mechanism range interaction mainly respondent different country region therefore differ cultural background personal experience accordingly judge whether interaction variable regression model must used experiment multiple linear regression model showed interaction gender age education level residential type relatively weak shown table may location experiment nanjing jiangsu province china respondent chinese national area large population mobility nanjing interaction gender age education level residence type unstable experimental research conclusion article simply quoted recalculated specific regional cultural context ensure objectivity experiment demographic characteristic landscape feature visual preference different gender group landscape feature gender difference influence elderly people visual impact assessment pocket park landscape revealed study tree height medium green space ratio leisure facility significant effect improving elderly men visual impact assessment elderly woman visual demand satisfied following landscape specification height tree 0–3 number colour five landscape three-layered elderly men enjoy engaging leisure activity sunbathing chatting playing chess jogging practicing tai chi pocket park activity demand hard paving easily meet need elderly men use park green ground covering tree height 3–6 provide good shading effect facilitating activity elderly men similar roof pocket park providing shade summer shelter winter addition elderly men likely participate sport activity social factor leisure facility provide social gathering place elderly men extent explains elderly men prefer 6-m-high greening medium proportion green space pocket park landscape leisure facility finding consistent study yücel robinson compared elderly men elderly woman pay attention need safety tree height 0–3 three layer landscape form single-sided double-sided shelter creating good sense spatial boundary isolate noise form semiprivate space enhance sense security elderly woman addition tree height 0–3 line scale chinese garden making people feel intimate compared single-layer landscape pure forest pure grass greening landscape structure three layer maintain improve vigorous vitality pocket park greening woman desire beauty lead prefer pocket park landscape five colour possibly richer colour plant satisfy people pursuit beauty visual preference elderly group different residential condition landscape feature residential type elderly respondent also affected visual impact assessment pocket park landscape concluded study elderly people lived family preferred pocket park landscape medium green space ratio leisure facility contrast people lived alone preferred landscape tree 0–3 high five colour medium leisure facility china task taking care child usually rest elderly individual especially live alone also need take care young child exercise socialize pocket park higher number leisure facility provide place exercise communication also meet need care young child fun people different age pocket park medium proportion green space provide soft grass ensure safety child play hard pavement provide playground elderly individual addition elderly individual live alone usually assume responsibility taking care spouse unable move flat rigid square weaken resistance elderly couple use pocket park together extent explains elderly people live alone prefer pocket park landscape medium proportion green space leisure facility due decline elderly people visual function tedium loneliness retirement life elderly individual especially live alone still certain viability hope able integrate community recognized accepted due fear ageing loss adl function elderly individual live alone likely engage antiaging activity prefer diverse bright colour greening five colour stimulate reduced sens also contribute vigorous unrelenting mentality regard selection activity place elderly people prefer secluded place lush tree easily disturbed sight activity scale relatively small usually limited 2–4 people sitting idly chat communication interaction others release feeling emotion therefore pocket park landscape tree 0–3 high five colour medium leisure facility attractive elderly people live alone limitation future research direction selection plant specie one limitation study common shrub tree field photo used landscape parameter factor intervention although method widely used previous researcher fails fully reflect diversity plant specie park subtropical monsoon region photo paper taken spring although photo represent landscape characteristic season year climatic condition nanjing fail fully reflect landscape characteristic throughout year especially winter study take account respondent may different landscape preference different season future study explore impact seasonal factor preference comprehensively ass respondent preference pocket park landscape questionnaire frequency respondent use pocket park assessed may potential impact result example respondent use park frequently may evaluate landscape characteristic park positively therefore follow-up study suggested explore relationship frequency pocket park use landscape preference conclusion elderly people physical function decline retirement life rather limited activity scope small sense pocket park become main site leisure activity elderly people city improving quality pocket park landscape contribute psychological recovery elderly people delay body function decline turn improves quality later life designing pocket park landscape suitable elderly people designer need understand demand elderly people different demographic characteristic design desirable pocket park landscape accordingly starting relationship landscape feature pocket park elderly people visual impact assessment study found elderly people different gender different residential type tend choose different pocket park landscape elderly men prefer pocket park landscape 6-m-high tree medium green space ratio leisure facility elderly woman favour pocket park landscape 3-m-high tree five colour three layer elderly people live family prefer pocket park landscape medium green space ratio leisure facility elderly people live alone prefer pocket park landscape tree 0–3 high five colour medium leisure facility study reference significance value future construction urban pocket park provide insight future researcher institutional review board statement work approved committee china university mining
