introduction psychotherapy process research aim study psychotherapy work factor associated specific outcome objective achieved outcome and/or process-based research include evaluating therapy outcome and/or critical aspect process in-therapy session behavior quality interaction client therapist respectively therapist client mutual collaboration agreement goal task therapeutic work treatment process along secure bond dyad usually referred therapeutic alliance relational factor considered effective robust predictor therapy outcome across different psychotherapy approach mental health diagnosis indicated several meta-analyses alliance dyadic dynamic construct therapist patient collaboratively contribute context session across therapy session despite different evaluation across treatment may exist dyad considering stronger alliance emerges negotiation process understandable estimation patient therapist may diverge beginning therapy although seems converge time towards end successful therapy success negotiation process benefit patient therapist allowing form trusting relationship engage interpersonal social process affiliative aligned interaction available research therapist variable mediating moderating quality alliance focused factor like interpersonal skill communication skill empathy experience training intrapersonal dimension study role patient contribution pinpointed factor initial symptom severity type diagnosis patient interpersonal skill attachment style furthermore study looked patient evaluation alliance others considered therapist patient side alliance whether independent related perspective considering subjective dynamic nature therapist patient evaluation quality interpersonal process inherent alliance experience increasing interest analyzing factor may related alliance development biological variable i.e. physiological reactivity accordance study suggested physiological measure may capture related characteristic e.g. empathy engagement facilitate hinder formation working alliance therefore useful objective measure estimating alliance evidence shown positive relationship client perception therapist empathy therapist client physiological concordance measured skin conductance measure eda role pre-therapy physiological variable also demonstrated trauma-focused therapy study showing lower pretherapy patient eda predicted stronger working alliance end week therapy result also consistent intervention study i.e. evidence showing variation client physiological activity therapeutic interaction influenced therapist behavior analysis heart rate another physiological measure studied psychotherapeutic context study therapeutic alliance found therapist client heart rate decreased beginning therapy session towards end therapeutic alliance increased furthermore positive relation in-session high-frequency heart rate variability hrv therapeutic alliance documented client receiving cognitive behavior therapy physiological reactivity accepted interpersonal aspect essentially influenced interactive exchange occurring within social context basis evidence currently available interplay two autonomic branch sympathetic para-sympathetic seems represent easily individual shift arousal state high low level reactivity therefore physiological response i.e. cardiac output eda seem underlying social behavior emotional process influencing perception safety consequently allowing engagement social interaction particularly evident psychotherapy assume quality expression emotional cognitive process occur throughout therapy process therapeutic dyad influence way therapist client join therapeutic interaction consequently construct therapeutic alliance however study focused relationship quality therapeutic alliance therapist client in-session physiological activity limited understanding role parasympathetic nervous system e.g. hrv therapeutic alliance based analysis interpersonal synchrony pattern therefore study considered therapist patient physiological data using eda heart rate possible barometer therapeutic alliance integrating clinical physiological data in-session throughout session client therapist require highly complex analytical model traditional statistical approach allow analyze relationship measure power provide important information specific temporal nature data particularly physiological data complex relation different psychotherapy measure limited recent advancement field computer science resulted strong development predictive model using large amount data data mining machine learning technique proved relevant mental health care specifically psychotherapy technique proposed promising tool addressing complexity psychotherapy process namely accounting dynamic process occurs therapist client throughout therapy scoping review exploring broadly application psychotherapy identified fifty-one study aimed develop test model inform method application

process coding specifically context therapeutic relationship research study demonstrated relevant application ass therapist interpersonal relational skill specifically study focusing therapeutic alliance discussed applicability machine learning natural language processing session recording predict client-rated therapeutic alliance using large naturalistic psychotherapy dataset based result author concluded linguistic signal indicative strength alliance showing technique useful tool analyzing therapeutic alliance line zhou al. also employed deep learning algorithm predict first session alliance successfully technique may contribute understanding role in-session emerging dynamic interpersonal process analyzing underlying neurophysiological substrate dyadic level client therapist although biological variable eda diffuse construct reliably observable others analyzed study psychotherapy might reliable signal in-session dynamic related empathy safety engagement compassion emotional co-regulation i.e. variable associated therapeutic alliance therefore objective exploratory study leverage data mining technique analyse uncover meaningful pattern psychotherapy dataset
