introduction lumbar spinal stenosis disease high morbidity affect approximately japanese population aged year typical symptom disease severe neurological leg pain numbness low back pain lbp patient tend walk trunk leaning forward symptom relieved leaning forward neurological symptom alleviated surgery including spinal canal decompression and/or spinal fusion surgical treatment particularly effective patient severe stenosis improves walking ability recent advance minimally invasive surgery however since reported walking forward-bending posture continues even decompression surgery predicted preoperative posture assisting nerve compression forward bending learned remains global sagittal alignment important outcome lumbar degenerative disease positive sagittal vertical axis sva correlation lbp poor clinical outcome health-related quality life consensus restoration sagittal spinopelvic alignment particularly normalization sva indispensable reasonable clinical outcome postoperative spinal orthosis therapy thought immobilize segmental motion enhance fusion rate reduce pain however unclear whether use orthosis contributes improvement malalignment lumbar surgery katsuhira developed trunk orthosis joint providing resistive force torf trunk solution co. ltd tokyo japan reported torf could enhance forward tilt pelvis upright posture trunk decreasing low back
