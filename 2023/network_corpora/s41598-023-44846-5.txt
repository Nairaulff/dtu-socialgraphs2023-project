introduction growing problem aging sarcopenia becoming bigger public health issue sarcopenia defined age-related loss muscle mass plus low muscle strength and/or low physical performance asian working group sarcopenia awgs recent systematic review indicates overall prevalence sarcopenia chinese community-dwelling older adult aged year 17.4 link low muscle strength adverse health outcome long established accumulating evidence demonstrated strength functional decline associated sarcopenia turn contribute disability frailty fall mortality patient sarcopenia also significantly increased risk comorbidities type diabetes heart failure chronic kidney disease therefore due high prevalence disease-associated comorbidity mortality sarcopenia contributes significantly disease burden geriatric disease entity requires attention accumulating evidence suggesting fatty acid intermediate lipid metabolism play significant role modulating skeletal muscle mass function sarcopenia feature reduced stem cell terminally differentiated myofibers replaced fatty fibrous tissue deuteric alteration lipid derivative accumulate within muscle cell intercellular compartment promoting lipo-toxicity inducing oxidative stress mitochondrial malfunction inflammation insulin resistance whether dyslipidemia involved pathogenesis sarcopenia remains unclear previous study exploring association
