introduction nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld one important cause liver disease approximately estimated prevalence worldwide become one major cause end-stage liver disease coming decade nafld also quickly growing cause hepatocellular carcinoma liver transplant united state however nafld show symptom develops cirrhosis process usually take seven year thus nafld patient benefit early diagnosis appropriate management machine learning used develop model classify subject without nafld however previous study included subject center health status general people recently different year
