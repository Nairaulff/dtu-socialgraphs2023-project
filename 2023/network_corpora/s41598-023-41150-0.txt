introduction neisseria gonorrhoeae causative agent sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea present substantial global antimicrobial resistance threat due increased rate infection well prevalence multidrug-resistant gonorrhoeae strain worldwide world health organization listed gonorrhoeae priority high tier risk public health dual therapy azithromycin azm ceftriaxone standard-of-care treatment gonococcal infection however due increasing resistance azithromycin region potent anti-commensal activity dual therapy cdc removed azm treatment regimen gonorrhea therefore ceftriaxone remains recommended antibiotic treatment gonococcal infection however concerning trend increasing resistance treatment option leading emergence commonly referred super gonorrhea form gonorrhea characterized extensive drug resistance high-level resistance recommended antibiotic ceftriaxone azithromycin addition class antibiotic consequently world face real possibility untreatable gonococcal infection
