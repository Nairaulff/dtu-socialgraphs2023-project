discussion study shown viral isolation efficiency saliva specimen significantly lower nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimen covid-19 result analysis value viral isolation efficiency saliva specimen

isolation efficiency saliva specimen significantly lower wuhan strain delta omicron variant sars-cov-2 difference observed alpha variant study specimen low value sufficiently collected among saliva specimen containing wuhan strain delta variant sars-cov-2 therefore possible viral isolation efficiency saliva specimen significantly lower real isolation efficiency hand number specimen could value

history vaccination covid-19 involvement specific antibody sars-cov-2 saliva could ruled therefore decrease infectivity sars-cov-2 considered due nature saliva comparing nasal/nasopharyngeal swab saliva sample using simulated specimen effect viral interference saliva clinical specimen previous experiment experimentally shown finally investigated component saliva responsible lower isolation rate saliva specimen sars-cov-2pv result showed among four candidate substance lactoferrin amylase inhibited sars-cov-2 infection reported lactoferrin inhibitory effect entry replication sars-cov-2 concentration lactoferrin normal saliva considered µg/ml although concentration lower used experiment thought anti-sars-cov-2 action saliva fact reported human breast milk contains higher concentration lactoferrin saliva infectious virus present breast milk even mother infected sars-cov-2 although experiment performed control vsvpv comparison significant inhibition observed although concentration-dependent decreasing trend observed therefore suggested lactoferrin higher inhibitory effect sars-cov-2 infection addition lactoferrin cytotoxic concentration used study suggesting may useful preventive medicine sars-cov-2 infection amylase also inhibited sars-cov-2 infection dose-dependent manner concentration u/ml higher however concentration amylase normal saliva reported u/ml much lower significant concentration used experiment therefore thought amylase slight protective effect vivo infection also show similar inhibitory effect vsvpv infection differs action lactoferrin specific sars-cov-2 reason decrease infectivities pseudotyped virus well understood since amylase enzyme degrades part sugar chain thought effect viral spike protein envelope protein entry cathelicidin mucin neither sars-cov-2pv vsvpv showed inhibitory effect infection rather cathelicidin enhancing effect infection high concentration experiment considered substance contained saliva enhancing effect sars-cov-2 infection inhibitory effect may largely derived lactoferrin addition although physiological concentration amylase alone completely prevent sars-cov-2 infection thought synergize lactoferrin exert anti-sars-cov-2 activity assumed factor led lower isolation rate saliva specimen compared nasal/nasopharyngeal swab specimen although study examined four substance considered abundant saliva suspected substance specific saliva may also involved finding speculated infectious sars-cov-2 viral particle abundant nasal cavity nasopharynx saliva even number genome copy result rrt-pcr test found saliva act defensive manner regard infectious disease although completely inhibits sars-cov-2 infection future necessary continue study component saliva act sars-cov-2
