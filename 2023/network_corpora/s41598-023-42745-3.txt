introduction distrust associated mis/disinformation—however defined—is widespread threat public health e.g. abortion covid-19 mpox previously called monkeypox science e.g. climate change election process even national security pandemic exacerbated issue many people turned trusted online community advice share distrust official health messaging within month u.s. national emergency declaration facebook—the largest widely used social medium platform—saw increase messaging increase time spent driving monthly active user 2.6 billion combat growth online distrust mis/disinformation myriad ingenious mitigation strategy introduced implemented social medium platform instance facebook funded internal effort like adding misinformation label post mercury project spearheaded social science research council support philanthropic organization like rockefeller foundation robert wood johnson foundation craig newmark philanthropy funded vaccine promotion campaign depending mitigation scheme funding source focus typically specific topic e.g. covid-19 election climate change geographical scale specific state national e.g. aps worldwide e.g. e.u. however despite diversity mitigation scheme distrust continues widespread provide answer question counterintuitive solution answer suggests specifically show post-pandemic distrust developed massive glocal web that—within individual community across interconnected communities—blends distinct topic location geographic scale make resilient current mitigation scheme focus specific topic geographic scale e.g due funding mandate given scheme

mis/disinformation fact-checking verification public awareness campaign collaborative initiative research global program rather banning community strategy implemented address false narrative related topic like covid-19 public health election climate change instance facebook funded internal effort like adding misinformation label post mercury project conducted vaccine promotion campaign many strategy operate national level like n't feed beast campaign others global focus like united nation verified initiative strategy aim limit spread impact misinformation encouraging critical thinking accurate reporting authoritative voice however persistent exposure narrative via social connection enable reactivation silenced misinformation thus deactivation refers temporarily 'silencing community
