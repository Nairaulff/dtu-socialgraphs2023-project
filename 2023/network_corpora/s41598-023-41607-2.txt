introduction testosterone involved complex social interaction seminal study role testosterone male social behavior suggested level increase response challenge promoting physical aggression challenge hypothesis later social status hypothesis posited role testosterone pro-social interaction might driver behavior tend increase individual motivation ability acquire maintain social status evolutionary theory imply risk-taking may evolved behavioral strategy social status achievement individual much lose risk-averse individual little lose individual difference risk-taking may biological basis involves hormone testosterone cortisol challenge social status hypothesis regarding involvement testosterone predict association testosterone status-seeking behavior dominance aggression finding often inconsistent dual-hormone hypothesis dhh developed explain inconsistences research testosterone human social behavior hypothesis posit framework interaction testosterone cortisol predict status-seeking behavior e.g. leadership social status aggressive violent behavior risk taking therefore suggests alternative approach examine risk-taking whereby testosterone may indirectly impact aggressive dominant behavior cortisol role moderator testosterone hence mehta joseph suggested testosterone association status-relevant behavior depends cortisol level positive association testosterone status-seeking behavior stronger cortisol level low attenuated cortisol level high i.e. high low continuum scale hereafter cortisol released individual experience challenging
