explanation result point importance taking life-course approach treatment oral disease distal variable play important role causality event investigated study older child teeth exposed risk longer therefore susceptible oral disease caries although identified significant specific indirect path main result derived estimate direct effect could achieved using conventional regression model however important note conceptually conventional regression method appropriate assessing temporal order since consider temporal sequence factor sem hand address consideration yet requires large amount data preparation obtain model-fit criterion analysis test multiple path variable analyze different parameter depending number variable sample size model may reach saturation minimize limitation sem used parsimonious model considering main variable related outcome paying careful attention data preparation another study limitation use nyvad criterion although validated used international study visual-tactile method may provide accurate assessment caries activity minimize possible error examiner received prior training obtaining acceptable level inter- intra-rater reliability despite performing additional analysis including child least teeth able completely remove confounding effect number erupted teeth sample included young child 12–30 month teeth research involving child complete set deciduous teeth may help gain better understanding relationship sga s-ecc however study may susceptible bias confounders memory bias loss teeth due caries reason longer exposure risk factor hampering measurement disease incidence producing estimate point direction non-association another limitation use kramer criterion based canadian birthweight standard brazilian child potentially leading overestimation sga child kramer criterion seek minimize methodological bias birthweight gestational age curve minimize problem also analyzed association sga e-ecc using intergrowth-21st standard data brazilian child also important highlight lower incidence sga child using standard observed study may explained fact measure tends underestimate sga despite limitation one strength study use sem method allows interpretation causal structure estimate direct indirect effect mediation provides better confounder control well adjusting common cause model also allowed build matrix causal relationship organized hierarchically distal intermediate proximal cause based hypothesis testing overall fit model another strength used data cohort study large sample carried socioeconomically disadvantaged region giving high statistical power fact performed sensitivity analysis using two different criterion sga another strong point furthermore caries assessment consider disease activity identify early lesion avoiding underestimation incidence s-ecc type assessment therefore appropriate study involving young child considering time take lesion progress cavity addition
