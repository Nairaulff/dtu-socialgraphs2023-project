respectively compared current laboratory approach result contrasting similar study noted significant difference number wound swab specimen would interpreted differently using score e.g greater number

previously initiated quality improvement practice related swab collection therefore swab quality relatively good comparison additional study across various healthcare facility would beneficial ass potential impact procedural change laboratory testing volume identify unit intervention may needed e.g diagnostic antimicrobial stewardship education specimen collection others important note using score alone reject low quality specimen may result primary pathogen missed laboratory considering implementing screening approach evaluate specimen retention policy communicate time period within

wound swab promotion collecting specimen higher diagnostic yield setting implementing score grading minimal quality improvement due small percentage swab reassuring collection practice study several limitation sample size limiting factor initial smear comparison study limited analysis could performed ass potential implication change smear grading antimicrobial stewardship practice clinical management thus unable quantify impact change outside laboratory setting similarly recognize method superficial swab collection may standardized point collection however levine technique promoted wound care education throughout institution also unable extrapolate finding swab collected specifically culture obligate anaerobic bacterial pathogen additional study needed investigate factor important note laboratory grading scheme sole solution quality issue surrounding wound swab culture technique examined study may represent best effort reduce number swab processed microbiology laboratory result may always clinically actionable improving overall quality swab culture laboratory utilization requires interdisciplinary intervention involves communication collaboration among healthcare provider may include intervention implementation continuing education program related swab collection indication collection laboratory interested adopting score approach part quality
