slower growing hybrid sensitive seasonal change faster growing broiler finding present study support high growth rate major contributor development ascites estimated prevalence condemnation due growth retardation resulting broiler considerably smaller conspecific three time higher ross hubbard table somewhat surprising previous research found higher frequency runt lower uniformity slower growing broiler might effect gender difference causing reduced uniformity increasing age mixed-sex flock explanation finding might different cause growth retardation broiler differing growth rate one factor could slower growing broiler hungry spend time eating leaving time space feeder broiler reason smaller slower rest get sufficient nutrition even slower growing broiler kept longer grew larger table maximum stocking density measured kg/m day slaughter hubbard flock fewer individual turn lead increased availability feeder drinker another likely explanation lower disease prevalence hubbard indicated lower condemnation number hence fewer individual growth retardation caused underlying disease vasdal found poorer flock uniformity increasing mortality suggesting uniformity associated broiler health status present study condemnation due discolouration common ross compared hubbard although common cause hubbard found 21.9 condemned carcass condemnation category included deviant colour carcass either darker lighter colour deviant smell carcass without detection condemnation code main reason discolouration quality defect related myodegenerative disorder e.g. wooden breast

reduced space available capillary blood supply fast-growing broiler finding reduced prevalence slower growing broiler line previous research meat condemned condition considerable economic impact furthermore report study scored recorded welfare indicator suggest myopathy like may affect animal welfare norring found broiler affected higher gait score kawasaki found inhibits extensibility muscle
