influencing virus–host interaction clinical outcome covid-19 understanding relationship comorbidities therapy covid-19 mortality needed efficiently guide clinical public health intervention moreover fully understanding characteristic covid-19-related severity respiratory distress also necessary early identification precise treatment paper aim evaluating effect covid-19 risk factor in-hospital
