ercp common procedure performed fluoroscopic guidance however study evaluated actual radiation lens eye ercp using specific dosimeter radiation exposure lens eye study revealed radiation exposure lens eye wearing eye dosimeter dosiris™ lateral eye median estimated annual lens dose 3.7 msv operator endoscopists measured shortest distance fluoroscopy table addition suggested estimated annual radiation exposure lens eye high-volume hospital ercps may reached approximately msv although number ercp procedure varied among hospital analyzed radiation dose per hour fluoroscopy revealed median time reach msv per year shortest estimate radiation exposure lens eye medical personnel using phantom model report examining relationship fluoroscopy time considered valuable although unlikely single endoscopist would reach time msv significant difference observed hospital suggest radiation dose lens eye highly dependent facility environment therefore important know amount radiation exposure lens eye received hospital although study dosimeter attached lead glass interventional radiology gradually increasing eye dosimeter widely used daily practice require additional time cost effort therefore important examine whether body dosimeter exposure represent radiation exposure lens eye present study showed measurement result glass badge worn lead apron similar radiation dose measured eye dosimeter operator largely differed assistant nurse moreover large variation measured value among hospital result suggest measurement result glass badge worn lead apron enough used substitute eye dosimeter study found strong positive correlation occupational radiation exposure lens eye value radiation exposure patient result suggest radiation exposure value patient used estimate occupational radiation exposure lens eye therefore even radiation exposure lens eye directly measured eye dosimeter reduce aware drls facility exposure value proportional occupational radiation exposure lens eye consequently medical radiation exposure control using drls becoming important addition evaluated shielding effect lead glass radiation protection ercp found shielding effect operator assistant nurse respectively difference shielding rate occupation may influenced positional relationship irradiator movement medical staff procedure result similar reported experimental study showed lead glass decreased eye lens exposure approximately however verification actual ercp rarely reported fact shielding effect lead glass could expected ercp also considered major strength study based result recommend use lead glass ercp study several limitation first study dosimeter worn individual basis shared operator assistant nurse consecutive ercp procedure facility made difficult ass individual difference medical radiation exposure allowed identify difference facility second annual exposure estimated three month data may accurately represent annual exposure however evaluation conducted using
