dirty farm could probably establish favourable condition presence existence cryptosporidium oocysts surround environment animal increasing risk contamination food water hence increase risk cryptosporidium infection calf present finding directly line previous finding ayele observed prevalence cryptosporidium increased significantly among calf feeding pasture milk may due pasture contaminated infectious oocysts switching pasture milk may produce digestive disturbance increase prevalence cryptosporidiosis cryptosporidiosis cause sever watery diarrhea calf finding present study revealed strong association presence diarrhea prevalence cryptosporidium calf explained fact diarrheal animal higher rate oocyst shedding calf regular faeces consistent found previous study el-khodery osman abebe could result infection causing villous atrophy crypt hyperplasia reduces intestine surface area available absorption consequently interfere absorption water glucose sodium leading diarrhea additionally parasite may able decrease activity enzyme disaccharidase would reduce amount sugar broken would lead bacterial growth production volatile fatty acid change osmotic pressure would cause severe watery diarrhea different animal specie human susceptible cryptosporidium infection infection transmitted direct indirect route fecal–oral route consequently mixing different animal specie could facilitate transmission disease similarly mohammed observed keeping animal separately avoiding close contact animal various specie reduce risk cryptosporidium infection conclusion prevalence cryptosporidium infection widely spreading among calf studied governorates rate 18.84 based present finding age feed source farm hygiene occurrence diarrhea interaction various domestic animal risk factor cryptosporidium infection essential raise awareness risk factor source infection mode transmission control reduce disease transmission animal human molecular research different area country
