event data often temporally imprecise counteract issue allow exact pas annotation work presented novel framework pas event refinement based existing event data first step feature player-ball distance ball acceleration obtained spatiotemporal position data extracted construct classifier general pas event detection based swiftevent subsequently classifier employed refine existing pas event event data fit expert annotation process classifier generates respective confidence score applied detection localization error i.e inaccurate location ball position data experimental result shown superiority proposed solution term temporal accuracy refined pas event compared annotation existing event data another statistical baseline statistical baseline address systematic error delayed pas annotation original event data furthermore shown replacing classifier logistic regression cause significant decrease performance especially localization error promotes choice adaption swiftevent optimal classifier framework in-depth analysis various system parameter conducted shown robustness system well efficiency outlier detection remove unreliable positional data point parameter setting various complexity investigated result demonstrated lightweight solution already improve temporal accuracy pass drastically due absence public test benchmark common evaluation protocol overall performance proposed solution discussed relation result another complex state-of-the-art approach pas detection better performance investigated evaluation metric future assume significant improvement utilizing data video tracking system positioning system including three-dimensional ball position finally believe given sufficiently large sample size manual annotation algorithm may modified event event data e.g. shot tacklings enable synchronization position data
