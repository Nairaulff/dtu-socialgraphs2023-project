introduction distribution status one basic piece information specie crucial formulating conservation strategy endangered specie global specie distribution pattern shaped multiple factor including anthropogenic disturbance pollution land-use land-cover change overexploitation climate change rapid expansion human activity dramatically changed environment worldwide reshaped global biodiversity caused well-documented shift spatial distribution wildlife addition global ecosystem biodiversity suffering climate change one serious global environmental concerns—posing multiple threat ecosystem specie population distribution several animal plant specie suffered dramatic decline even extinction recent decade due ongoing climate change distribution specie likely continuously affected continuous expansion human activity increasingly frequent climate change therefore essential determine current distribution pattern specie factor affecting distribution specie distribution model sdms widely used predict potential distribution habitat suitability specie given area using occurrence data specie environmental data particularly large spatial temporal scale various software program designed construct sdms performed well using presence-only datasets e.g. bioclim domain life comparison others need presence absence data e.g. generalized linear model glm generalized additive model gam however absence data either difficult obtain strenuous interpret since specie database generally record presence data hence several approach used generate pseudoabsence data e.g. selecting random point study area simplest widely used method ecology due different performance individual model estimating uncertainty ensemble sdms recommended several researcher believe prediction accuracy higher single model selecting optimal sdms particular specie given area condition limited many factor e.g. specie body size environment complexity data resolution therefore ensemble sdms combine various individual model constructed different modelling technique widely used various package construct ensemble sdms exploited better predict potential distribution specie package biomod sdm water deer
