introduction dissemination new sars-cov-2 variant effect fragile segment population nursing mother newborn raising interest possible protective effect virus beginning covid-19 pandemic possibility breastfeeding mother infected sars-cov-2 questioned scientific society almost three year beginning pandemic large number paper published literature showing maternal condition permit breastfeeding possible encouraged fact addition many benefit breastmilk already known literature several study demonstrated presence antibody sars-cov-2 breastmilk infected vaccinated woman paper published collier showed infection vaccination elicited binding neutralizing antibody breastmilk however antiviral activity breastmilk doe depend exclusively specific antibody directed virus previously encountered mother author speculated phylogenetic origin mainly immune purpose mammary gland suggested correspondence antimicrobial substance mucous epithelial secretion secreted lactocytes described paper published vorbach known breastmilk contains numerous bioactive factor proven non-specific antiviral capacity compound belonging various class molecule lipid enzyme protein probably synergistic action

analyzed presented article regard presence anti-sars-cov-2 antibody elisa assay expected positive mother group showed variable presence amount antibody directed virus various time-points presence tends decrease time although significantly shown previous study surprisingly presence antibody directed sars-cov-2 also demonstrated milk negative mother group lesser extent lower milk mother group result could due previous sars-cov-2 infection asymptomatic therefore unrecognized unreported mother intriguingly presence antibody especially iga class directed coronaviruses capable cross-reacting sars-cov-2 thus affecting test already shown previous study literature plasma saliva specific activity sars-cov-2 antibody detected milk positive mother also supported direct correlation found presence antibody neutralizing activity breastmilk sample contrary correlation found milk negative mother observation support hypothesis antiviral activity might exerted non-specific component
