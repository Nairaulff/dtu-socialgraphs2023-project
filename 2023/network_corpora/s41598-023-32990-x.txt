contrast observation yellowstone national park year return wolf decline deer population accompanied significant decrease number young tree damaged increase young tree survival see kauffman result also differ study scandinavia presence wolf effect damage caused moose pine plantation consistent result study moose browsing pine higher wolf territory however highlighted north america predation large prey sometimes wishful thinking trophic cascade may weaker claimed strongly dependent adequate sampling obvious question arises doe presence wolf increase browsing pressure deer sapling according optimal foraging theory intuitive answer deer browsing pressure wolf-inhabited landscape may concentrated place high food availability good visibility young large forest plantation behaviour help animal minimise foraging time easily detect danger predator confirmation explanation come result study conducted north america showing deer minimise risk preyed upon coursing predator relying early detection facilitated use large-sized open forest plantation although dense vegetation cover near forest edge may provide safety deer reducing detection may obstruct visibility escape route increasing predation risk apex predator would explain distance forest edge statistically significant factor case beech plantations—these gap small 0.1 provide sufficient distance early detection predator deer likely felt equally safe unsafe within entire plantation confirmed second hypothesis deer foraging behaviour varies spatially specific spatial condition however sometimes forest edge safest location simply attractive location trade-off made provide cover safety open space grazing safer time wolf risk important factor creating landscape fear influencing deer foraging behaviour even commercial forest human activity e.g. recreation hunting influence deer browsing behaviour stand landscape level fear triggered anthropogenic disturbance rather presence large predator although hunting pressure within study area relatively high compared region poland due alike deer density similar three analysed forest district included factor experimental design additionally suggests risk effect caused wolf presence ecosystem may strong enough found even intensively human-disturbed landscape one might wonder whether result obtained affected difference density deer within study area especially since available data indicate strong relationship density deer foraging intensity however previously mentioned study significant difference foraging intensity found deer density ranging dozen several dozen individuals/km contrast density varied presented study individuals/km therefore opinion effect deer density level browsing damage negligible since process forest colonisation wolf poland relatively fast challenge find suitable site research able locate three area region similar although identical natural condition different status wolf population landscape similar study include area better analyse effect large predator deer behaviour forest regeneration although believe research provided satisfactory result study suggests apex predator alter deer browsing intensity young tree survival within forest plantation anthropogenic forest ecosystem spatial differentiation landscape fear however must remember earliest stand stage commercial forest represent part total ecosystem deer browsing pressure may lower stage forest development although threat posed human hunter thought important determinant cervid response commercial forest day hunting season observed pattern change distance forest edge selection deer face cursorial predator found open-spaced centre large-sized clearcuts young forest distant older forest edge seem safest place deer reduce predation risk wolf browse northern poland however general rule example result study conducted scandinavia indicated habitat represent highest risk predation moose study suggests presence wolf significantly affect forest regeneration influencing foraging behaviour browsing wild herbivore fine-scale conservation temperate forest benefit reduction time deer spend browsing forest patch high biodiversity value silviculture benefit reduction time deer spend browsing forest plantation wolf support result also relevant field studying cascading effect predator shape forest general perceive wolf factor reduce
