introduction salmonella enterica considered one important foodborne pathogen producing global economic impact public health annually approximately million case human gastroenteritis 155,000 death due salmonella infection worldwide poultry poultry product main important source human salmonella infection outbreak caused chicken known carrier salmonella gut according european union one health zoonosis report broiler source 70.0 serotyped salmonella isolates enteritidis infecting poultry-producing fowl paratyphoid associated occurrence human salmonellosis last year salmonella still major problem facing poultry industry risk arising mortality also economic loss reduced efficiency occur result bird infection unfortunately pathogen infect chick still hatchery throughout process hatching sexing receiving vaccination transported even first feed current poultry production system lack contact chick adult bird slows colonization intestinal tract beneficial microbe initial microbial colonization crucial promote immune system growth maturation well prevent harmful bacteria colonizing competitive exclusion particularly newborn animal rapid growth rate gut health function crucial supplying essential nutrient growth maintenance elimination drug used growth promoter animal diet treatment different pathogen important point must considered avoid misuse antibiotic facilitates generation antibiotic resistance gene bacteria infecting poultry farm emergence multidrug resistance salmonella isolates affecting food chain become public health concern worldwide therefore many approach implemented control salmonella intestinal bacteria infecting poultry ovo inoculation probiotic improves intestinal epithelium immune system health condition bird also increase egg hatchability reduces embryonic mortality increase posthatch growth performance probiotic live culture microbe beneficial effect host health application poultry diet improves bird immune response
