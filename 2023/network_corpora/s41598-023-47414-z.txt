consequence behavior followed reward e.g. social approval likely occur future whereas behavior followed punisher e.g. reprimand likely occur future placebo effect also shaped consequence one pain behavior study adamczyk colleague participant rewarded reporting lower pain punished reporting higher pain following placebo resulted placebo hypoalgesia real world patient healthy individual encounter unlimited number possible reward punishers behavior food social attention money opportunity engage preferred activity existing study placebo hypoalgesia induced operant conditioning employed verbal feedback e.g. 'good 'bad displayed screen form reinforcement also demonstrated research field praise effectively increase frequency desired behavior individual however individual dealing pain-related issue exposed reinforcer verbal feedback fordyce identified three potential reward chronic pain behavior attention others relief pain financial gain social sign approval disapproval conveyed eye contact physical contact facial expression proven effective shaping behavior existing study carried small sample e.g. distribution token akin financial gain common strategy reinforcing

conditioning operant conditioning paradigm likelihood behavior case certain reaction pain increase followed reward diminishes followed punisher thus voluntary behavior reinforced punished contrast classical conditioning automatic involuntary association created repeated pairing stimulus study conducted comparison three type reward punishers verbal social token-based specifically selected verbal reinforcer replication purpose used existing study placebo hypoalgesia induced operant conditioning since another objective investigate whether ecologically valid reinforcer could induce placebo hypoalgesia experimental setting opted compare verbal reinforcer social token-based one choice made token-based social reinforcer partially simulate reinforcement form money attention others known crucial factor shaping behavior chronic pain patient found reward punishers social cue token induce placebo hypoalgesia operant conditioning paradigm contrast hypoalgesic effect induced group receiving verbal reward punishers differ significantly control group received ointment application suggesting reinforcer significantly contribute induction placebo hypoalgesia moreover best knowledge second study date placebo hypoalgesia induced operant conditioning social reinforcer sign approval disapproval generalized conditioned reinforcer commonly used applied behavior analysis usually conveyed eye contact physical contact facial expression wield powerful influence shaping desired behavior social reward conveyed participant form video clip similar one used study shown cause improvement motor skill memory direct effect consolidation process verbal reprimand found effective suppressing behavior combined eye contact physical contact verbal reprimand alone study focused separate use different type reinforcement one may notice tentative correspondence result social reinforcer contained non-verbal cue correctness pain behavior effectively conveying similar message verbal one also kazdin klock found social reward smiling physical contact enhanced effectiveness verbal approval shaping classroom behavior reason social reward punishers might powerful influencing behavior verbal one firstly convey additional information namely emotional component addition mere feedback received result one action case verbal reward punishers approval gained others lead increased self-efficacy motivation hand disapproval result feeling shame guilt decreased self-worth disapproving facial expression indicates negative evaluation signal person done something socially undesirable thus leading individual change behavior avoid criticism therefore seems plausible approval disapproval expressed experimenter conditioning process enhances effectiveness conditioning emotional motivational factor another type reward punishers study appeared effective inducing placebo hypoalgesia based token economy gaining token act positive reinforcement increasing likelihood desired behavior repeated whereas losing token act negative punishment thus decreasing likelihood token economy particularly effective situation reward immediate proven work environment psychiatric hospital correctional facility similar social reinforcement token-based reinforcement provides feedback one performance also involve motivational factor increasing one intrinsic motivation another study showed simple accumulation recorded point used reward almost effective shaping stuttering behavior reward could exchanged tangible reward toy verbal praise study even though participant could exchange token gained anything tangible act receiving virtual token also served powerful reinforcement induced placebo hypoalgesia contrast verbal reinforcement also design procedure allowed participant always keep track total number token received could made correspondence behavior consequence easier notice however previous study placebo hypoalgesia induced operant conditioning reported significant effect verbal reinforcement differs finding essential note verbal reinforcement study involved one-word prompt displayed screen either good reward bad punisher contrast verbal reinforcement used prior study conveyed additional information high low could implement study due inclusion nonverbal reinforcement group difference study design additionally placebo used previous study took abstract non-medically connoted form namely color displayed screen whereas employed medically connoted placebo ointment evidence suggesting type placebo may influence magnitude placebo hypoalgesia study using medically-connoted placebo tend show larger effect employing non-medically connoted one could also cause difference result observed two study consequently future research could explore issue comparing different type placebo inducing placebo hypoalgesia within operant paradigm additionally investigating various type verbal reinforcer could provide valuable insight well effect different type reinforcer combined first study examined placebo hypoalgesia induced operant conditioning extinction effect found change magnitude time confirmed result pain intensity throughout posttest increase actually diminished experimental group hand pattern control group similar pain rated significantly lower end phase beginning one explanation would result due habituation process hand difference pain intensity pretest posttest statistically insignificant control group without ointment contrast group showed significant reduction pain intensity pretest posttest illustrated fig result suggest habituation process likely solely responsible decrease pain intensity posttest study placebo effect induced classical conditioning effect proven resistant extinction partial rather continuous schedule unconditioned stimulus used thus future research attempt determine whether non-continuous schedule reinforcement intermittent could indeed induce even robust resilient placebo hypoalgesia operant conditioning expectation regarding pain relief may derived information acquired e.g. learning process believed mediate placebo effect lead formation placebo response several study shown expectation upcoming pain contributed placebo effect induced classical conditioning review see mediated placebo hypoalgesia moreover evidence indicating expectation involved operant learning thus hypothesized similar relation would occur case operant conditioning placebo hypoalgesia indeed found change expectation regarding upcoming pain versus conditioning phase partly mediated placebo hypoalgesia experimental group interestingly significant difference pain change pretest posttest verbal reinforcement group control group ointment change expectation served significant mediator within verbal reinforcement group within control group ointment suggests manipulation induce expectation regarding upcoming pain intensity verbal reinforcement group though may sufficient contribute placebo hypoalgesia sum first study found mediation expectation placebo hypoalgesia induced operant conditioning secondly add existing body knowledge role expectation placebo hypoalgesia acquisition learning process another hypothesis confirmed number reward received conditioning would significant predictor magnitude placebo hypoalgesia bigger number reward smaller number punishers received better learning outcome greater magnitude placebo hypoalgesia unfortunately study design doe make possible compare efficacy reward punishers separately participant always received either reward punisher hence reward received fewer punishers administered future research focus separating effect two type consequence magnitude placebo hypoalgesia induced operant conditioning another interesting result appeared study occurrence hypoalgesic effect result mere application placebo ointment contain analgesic property furthermore participant receive information regarding property ointment yet found significant difference pain rating control group participant group ointment applied felt pain participant group ointment applied thus concluded mere application ointment experimenter induced placebo hypoalgesia result line research showing contextual factor therapeutic ritual around patient treatment influence brain activity therapeutic outcome unfortunately measure participant expectation pain intensity right ointment applied thus may hypothesize previous treatment experience induced expectation pain alleviation ointment application believed central element placebo hypoalgesia finding raise important issue placebo research emphasizing necessity including multiple control group study order distinguish placebo effect acquired experimental manipulation contextual effect especially medically connoted agent used placebo furthermore observed negative correlation conscientiousness magnitude placebo hypoalgesia induced operant conditioning finding consistent result obtained beedie foad coleman reported negative correlation conscientiousness agreeableness sport performance placebo condition however worth noting many previous study investigating placebo effect reported relationship consequently current evidence remains inconclusive underscoring need research exploring role personality trait placebo effect limitation study acknowledged firstly study conducted laboratory setting generalization result clinical population done caution basic science study represents initial step understanding role reinforcement placebo hypoalgesia finding confirmed research setting ecologically valid secondly subjective measure pain intensity expectation relying self-reports examined study although according definition pain pain always personal experience measurement relies mostly self-reports use objective measure biological marker future study would enrich obtained data thirdly sample size calculated need main analysis within-between interaction thus might insufficient detect correlation effect fully estimate mediation effect moreover possible speculate observed effect experimental group could attributed response bias participant intentionally rated pain intense order receive reinforcement without experiencing actual change pain sensation however data obtained posttest phase contradicts hypothesis participant experimental group consistently rated pain intense compared pretest rating even reinforcement process discontinued furthermore response control question provided participant suggest low likelihood response bias approximately participant correctly deduced true purpose study additionally majority participant indicated device used measure objective pain intensity accurate shown table conclusion present finding show importance operant conditioning inducing placebo hypoalgesia best knowledge study second confirm patient learn placebo effect result operant learning showed investigated reward punishers social approval token powerful changing pain
