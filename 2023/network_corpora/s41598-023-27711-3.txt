introduction feeding breeding activity carried provide necessary nutrient rapidly growing world population egg sector one main sector world increase egg production breeding study carried study chicken continuing due efficiency reason broiler layer specie selected breeding different feature broiler grow fast become ready cut short time hand layer grow fast heavy develop male female number chicken egg close presence male chick egg sector major problem make egg make profit grown sold slaughter therefore male chick selected sexers culled unethically using different method slaughter gas strangulation strangulation oxygen-free environment hatched minority painted sold pet shop assuming male chick separated consume lot feed slaughter income received slaughter much expense rooster eats

except morphological method method need complicated expensive tool egg perforated in-ovo egg sexing method applicable incubation therefore male egg getting wasted shape index method applicable incubation thus male egg sold market daily consumption furthermore earliest period in-ovo method ninth day incubation hence source still used alive-in-egg chick culled need industry-applicable reliable fast-working method chicken breed reason industrial in-ovo selection device still fully applicable poultry industry study used shape index method mostly duck duck egg model applied chicken egg different morphology dikmen suggested regression analysis instead classification model suggesting classification model chicken breed doe harm egg fast study sex determination using shape index egg
