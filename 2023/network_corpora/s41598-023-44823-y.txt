introduction predator–prey interaction critical understanding specie composition community assembly vital mechanism biodiversity maintenance bottom-up control prey essential resource constraint influence diversity prey specie predator however top-down regulation theory may fare better grasping issue prey specie diversity controlled top-downward due predation promotes diversification coexistence among prey specie impacting prey specie niche differentiation several previous study laboratory microcosm verified role predator structuring assembly diversity prey community nevertheless whether predator mediate prey specie composition community assembly natural community remains unclear community assembly specie key question community ecology influenced combination stochastic deterministic process predator affect pattern prey coexistence relative abundance diversity therefore also influencing relative importance stochastic versus deterministic process prey community assembly however assessment effect major challenge degree predator-mediated effect poorly known predator shape prey specie composition consumptive effect i.e. prey removal predation non-consumptive effect nces i.e. prey response driven predation risk may shift coexistence community assembly prey specie type predator also play key role community assembly prey specie generalist predator predicted

presence lutra influenced number fish specie also changed uniformity fish specie community diet lutra region mainly comprises stream fish phoxinus cottus cobitis make highest contribution unpublished data also dominant fish specie stream ecosystem region therefore stream fish predation lutra number dominant specie phoxinus decrease whereas uniformity fish specie community would enhanced thus resulting higher shannon–wiener index compared specialist predator generalist predator may completely remove prey specie local scale result generalist predator may alter interspecific competition prey specie nces enhance specie richness community although study doe explicitly elucidate mechanism stochastic process shaping fish community assembly speculate increasing -diversity fish community stochastic process primarily result presence lutra studied stream predator either strengthen stochastic process increase -diversity reducing population size prey population strengthen deterministic process leading specie extinction process simultaneously occur structuring community assembly study presence lutra associated reduced abundance dominant fish specie overall abundance fish clearly showed positive impact several rare fish specie study area e.g. malma masou reissneri process could enhance overall fish richness specie heterogeneity different river may contribute higher -diversity habitat variable stream also showed impact fish community diversity line evidence support stochastic process predominates community assembly fish specie verify coexistence mechanism fish specie study designed association phenotypic plasticity physiological response response nces functional group sensitive change specie richness especially functional group specie higher trophic level result indicate top-down effect lutra could enhance functional diversity stream fish may due regulation predator prey specie richness study three rare specie e.g. malma masou reissneri provided four unique functional group parasitism nutritional functional group flat strong spindle morphological functional group no-protagonist sinking egg reproductive functional group increased functional group owing higher specie richness rare specie often provide unique functional contribution thus loss functional diversity may constrain community ecosystem process conclusion result show presence lutra

population study also provides empirical field result emphasizes role predator maintaining biodiversity ecosystem function however interaction different fish specie unique habitat selection carnivorous fish specie may simultaneously impact fish community except impact lutra pilot preliminary research result help understanding predation prey community impact multi-predator interaction
