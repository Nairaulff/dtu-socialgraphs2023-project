introduction process selecting deciding priority research development project crucially important efficiently utilizing limited resource case government-funded program support large number project immense budget even greater emphasis efficient allocation resource many funding agency devote lot effort improving process selecting project one considering efficiency program one may select proposal anticipated yield stronger ex-post performance beneficiary project program reality however decision-making process selecting project complex requires consideration various factor project selection complicated requires ex-ante prediction performance expected achieved implementing candidate project despite uncertainty involved prediction need precisely define concept performance project success adopt commonly accepted method measuring also need determine theoretical analysis practical experience multiple input factor impact project performance furthermore need understand lag time uncertainty involved process activity manifest performance expert evaluation widely utilized help make complex decision project selection process expert evaluation considered one rational mean decision-making since provide reliable evaluation group expert knowledgeable specific field expert evaluation method especially useful evaluating new idea regarding reference data focused public funding small medium enterprise smes proposal smes also evaluated expert project performed smes heterogeneous science-oriented project tend application/development-oriented project therefore practice operationally worthwhile expert review whether grant approved however also several observation regarding limitation expert evaluation reference project selection first presence various type bias including optimism pessimism bias cognitive bias academic bias institutional particularism may influence subjective judgment leading unfair irrational result second since research discipline growing specialized sub-areas expertise time converging many aspect become challenging identify expert organize group capable fully understanding evaluating proposal third project selection process structured balance expert evaluation various criterion must considered rational decision-making finally evaluating large number proposal consumes lot time cost case given environment fails provide adequate time may impede evaluator making optimally rational judgment recently researcher proposed various data-based methodology designed overcome limitation expert evaluation new approach however focus assigning weighted value multiple criterion applied project selection systematically objectively integrating evaluation multiple expert therefore limited addressing fundamental problem expert evaluation discussed meanwhile active empirical research identify various critical success factor csfs affect success project however many success factor difficult quantify objectively empirical study relied likert scale measure survey response expert several study utilized machine learning technique determine relation project attribute performance however study focusing ex-ante prediction performance individual proposal smes applying prediction project selection possible predict performance individual candidate project implemented smes project selection using objective data model without relying qualitative judgment expert prediction rule based theoretically explainable practical effective compared qualitative method course unlikely possible entirely replace qualitative intuitive judgment expert exclusively data-based approach moreover selection prioritization project issue determined based efficiency alone nonetheless enhance efficiency public effort stimulate technological innovation smes need offer objective methodology supplement qualitative judgment expert response need derived new model predict whether candidate project achieve various performance indicator including success commercialization patent application based analysis data large number previously completed project process analyzed various factor involved attribute project firm market environment strongly affect
