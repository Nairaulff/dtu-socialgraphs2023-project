introduction recent decade online review become valuable source information assisting people making decision online platform whether purchase product given vast number online review prominent issue effectively elicit helpful information decision-making purpose regard many previous study considered average aggregation useful method specifically study suggested given collection different opinion online review e.g. different rating collection online review average opinion e.g. average rating collection online review provide helpful information e.g. rating best reflects quality target product compared individual opinion however recent study investigated online review detail many found average aggregation reliable way elicit helpful information main reason opinion online review overwhelmingly positive instance amazon.com well-known online shopping platform average rating review close 4.2 importantly average rating different product amazon.com reflect different feature e.g. quality product social psychological research theory suggest conformity—that changing one behaviour response pressure others—can help explain overwhelmingly positive rating people express opinion may conform majority opinion i.e. frequently occurring opinion existing review word previously expressed opinion distort subsequent opinion bring closer majority opinion research shown one reason people conform normative social influence people conform avoid standing negatively others eye viewed unfavourably thus regardless target product actual feature e.g. quality positive opinion 5-star rating likely become majority opinion online review specifically conformity due normative social influence tends result online review follow j-shaped distribution overwhelming positivity result average opinion e.g. average rating reflects online review degree overwhelming positivity fails offer helpful information find alternative approach elicit helpful information online review research focused outlier review outlier review refer review opinion largely deviate average i.e. review dissenting opinion see fig interesting paradox considering whether outlier review helpful reader perspective wisdom-of-crowds research outlier review helpful review conversely review may carry opinion larger bias often express minority opinion i.e. opinion expressed small number reviewer however social influence research social psychology field suggests different perspective minority opinion influence majority opinion serving source information accurate effective i.e. informational social influence strong accuracy goal shown allow people resist normative social influence especially prepared explain decision thus people write outlier review strongly accuracy-motivated expected resist normative positivity pressure provide compelling biased helpful information figure illustration outlier review blue line show hypothetical typical j-shaped distribution opinion overwhelming positivity online review grey solid vertical line show average rating j-shaped distribution red dotted vertical line illustrates rating typical example outlier review black dotted line reflects large difference rating average outlier opinion outlier opinion identified based either continuous discontinuous distribution full size image based discussion regarding outlier review following section empirically investigate whether outlier online review provide helpful information reader decision-making analysing large-scale dataset online review research make two contribution first offer simple effective approach eliciting helpful information online review previous study demonstrated various approach eliciting helpful information approach require sophisticated analysis review content study show based simple analysis review degree deviation average opinion i.e. outlier degree review people effectively identify helpful review thus research provides costly way harness online wisdom-of-crowds importantly based investigation mechanism underlying outlier review helpful research deepens understanding conformity related social influence process process always considered cause bias collective behaviour human mass scale however study reveals also stimulate valuable outcome collective behaviour result overview dataset metric outlier degree investigate helpfulness online outlier review
