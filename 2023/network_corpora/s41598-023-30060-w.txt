introduction inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia ioh defined core temperature recognized common adverse event among patient undergoing surgery general anesthesia shown ioh related numerous complication including surgical site infection thrombosis disturbed drug metabolism delayed emergence addition researcher found mild ioh increase blood loss whereas aggressive thermal management reduces blood transfusion recent study reported several factor associated incidence ioh including age year low body weight poor nutritional status general anesthesia combined high-level neuraxial anesthesia corresponding sympatholytic effect intraoperative infusion large volume unwarmed solution transfusion cold red blood cell duration anesthesia compared ordinary laparoscopic thoracoscopic operation robotic surgery commonly performed longer surgical duration unwarmed carbon dioxide artificial pneumoperitoneum wider surgical area trocars inserted result broader body exposure skin surface
