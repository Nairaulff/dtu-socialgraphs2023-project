extended past year recent report world health organization noted adding year life mixed blessing accompanied adding life year word increasing healthy life expectancy life without functional disability considered important increasing average life expectancy 10-year difference life expectancy healthy life expectancy shortening gap relevant urgent expand healthy life expectancy also reduce enormous socioeconomic impact poor health final year since declining health due functional disability make independent living community difficult clarifying risk factor functional disability shorten healthy life expectancy important cardiovascular disease one top cause functional disability influence health care system economy worldwide addition cardiovascular disease accelerates risk functional

arteriosclerosis frailty leading prevention cardiovascular disease maintenance muscle strength percentage people habitually engaged physical activity low regardless whether functional disability suggesting necessity promoting physical activity habit kumar showed recommendation doctor significant impact participation continuation cardiac rehabilitation kraus also reported risk mortality reduced person engaging one two rehabilitation session per week compared inactive study participant therefore physician question patient regarding exercise habit unfortunately could distinguish participant unable exercise sufficiently due cardiovascular disease participant history cardiovascular disease started regular exercise recommended physician thus future study needed clarify point

impairment activity daily living among elderly cardiopulmonary training intervention patient cvd reduced risk functional disability finding showed similar trend people history cad history cvd physical activity habit may prevent onset functional disability reduction frailty fracture dementia common risk factor functional disability addition cardiovascular disease increased risk functional disability due recurrence thus physical activity habit may contribute maintenance improvement muscle strength cardiopulmonary function leading suppression recurrence cardiovascular disease study strength large sample size accurate definition cad/cvd history functional disability using data health examination claim administrative database source allowed precisely identify almost patient condition follow-up study limitation first design retrospective data participant underwent physical examination blood test analyzed since medical checkup required construction database could compare characteristic underwent medical checkup thus could avoid selection bias second physical activity habit measured using simple one-item questionnaire rather precise measurement acceleration sensor may introduced measurement error following question asked japanese health examination engage light sweaty exercise least min least day week acquire information exercise intensity least mets generally mets sweaty included question question commonly used japan used objective method evaluate exercise worldwide also detailed data mean physical activity aerobic balance and/or resistance training combination moreover way identify participant whose physical activity either improved deteriorated follow-up thus physical activity might over- underestimated third follow-up period people died people using long-term care although significantly affect result analysis could considered bias fourth could ass detail participant needed ltci service thus detailed investigation needed include data main cause needing ltci service social relationship socioeconomic status employment status and/or income finally data anthropometric measurement dietary pattern mental health socioeconomic status social frailty living alone going infrequently friend thus future study necessary confirm finding considering important factor conclusion confounding factor study must resolved addition intervention study must conducted determine functional disability improve condition conclusion summary history cvd lack physical activity habit independently associated functional disability among japanese adult physical activity habit favorable influence avoiding functional disability regardless history cad cvd clinician encourage patient exercise clinical setting regardless history cardiovascular disease important prevention lifestyle-related disease also avoidance long-term care result healthy life expectancy would increase future interventional study focusing physical activity group needed apply finding
