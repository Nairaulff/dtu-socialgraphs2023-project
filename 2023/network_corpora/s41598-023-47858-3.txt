introduction since beginning coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic multiple variant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 identified worldwide variant different degree transmissibility disease severity multiple wave infection occurred okinawa prefecture emergence mutated strain fifth wave infection delta variant predominant okinawa entered sixth wave omicron variant predominant okinawa prefecture highest cumulative number infected people per 100,000 people japan two wave delta variant first isolated india december transmissible alpha variant japan delta variant first detected march airport quarantine station domestic infection confirmed april variant spread throughout country replacement alpha variant delta variant progressed rapidly approximately isolates genome decoded patient sample collected august metropolitan area identified delta variant national institute infectious disease niid used haplotype network determine least strain causing covid-19 japan originated abroad early day epidemic delta strain strain disappeared remaining delta strain subsequently spread nationwide okinawa delta variant first detected june became mainstream strain accounting infection approximately month delta variant associated increased risk hospitalization mortality omicron variant first isolated south africa november became prevalent country predominant strain united state america mutation spike protein japan omicron variant first detected november airport quarantine station subsequently report detection omicron variant issued multiple prefecture

hospitalization chest computed tomography widely used detect covid-19 pneumonia ass severity estimate prognosis patient reported lung damage caused omicron variant generally milder damage due variant
