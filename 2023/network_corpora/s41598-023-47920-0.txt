seropositivity proportion study previous analysis long-term cohort like nako overcome future providing basis harmonized longitudinal seropositivity analysis small number seropositive individual low education group group individual animal household may resulted low statistical power thus inability identify potential association regression model conclusion found low seropositivity across four study location across germany minor indication difference site seropositivity estimate year 2014–2019 four predominantly urban region correspond previous estimate 1997–1999 2008–2011 respectively

migration status appears additional factor lower seropositivity since many person migrating germany may come country little borrelia exposure
