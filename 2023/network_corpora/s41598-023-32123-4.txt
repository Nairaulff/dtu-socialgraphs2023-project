introduction infiltration peripheral intravenous vascular piv access cause various skin tissue injury child injury include severe consequence skin necrosis compartment syndrome may require surgical intervention addition piv access infiltration general anesthesia result inadequate delivery anesthetic medication may lead unexpected patient movement surgery previous study reported infiltration rate 2–3 child outside operating suite generally correct piv placement identified based clinical judgment e.g. blood aspiration syringe swollen appearance skin direct observation piv insertion site absence free drop infusion gravity however clinical judgment often inconclusive misleading surgical drape covering whole body child usually inhibit direct observation piv insertion site blood aspirated even correct piv access small vein child easily collapse negative pressure therefore pediatric anesthesiologist still desire alternative method confirming correct piv access surgery previous preliminary study shown precordial doppler ultrasound confirm correct piv placement detecting change doppler sound blood flow velocity technique precordial doppler monitor placed left right parasternal border

doppler attached induction anesthesia potentially used throughout surgery previously used injection dose 0.5 ml/kg based finding obtained small exploratory data set therefore minimally required dose confirming correct piv placement remains unknown repetitive intraoperative administration precordial ultrasound technique lead unnecessary skin-tissue damage piv infiltration exists meanwhile insufficient dose increase rate false-negative result attempting confirm correct piv placement thus critical need determine minimum amount required confirm correct piv access placement using precordial doppler ultrasound objective study determine minimally required dose confirming correct piv access placement using precordial doppler ultrasound hypothesized identification rate change

sensitive non-invasive test detection intravenous air embolus craniotomy preliminary study found sound change precordial doppler ultrasound injection 0.5 ml/kg s-test reflected correct piv placement sensitivity specificity furthermore increase cm/s blood flow velocity v-test indicated correct piv placement sensitivity specificity respectively however remained unclear whether appropriate use 0.5 ml/kg dose purpose optimal dose must investigated several reason first amount injection minimized avoid unnecessary volume loading even small amount may affect patient circulatory condition multiple injection administered especially patient cardiac renal disorder nevertheless correct piv placement need confirmed regular interval surgery multiple repeat injection required long surgical procedure insufficient dose may also increase risk false-negative result v-tests result unnecessary placement additional piv access interrupt surgical procedure study compared rate positive result v-tests different dose group v-test yielded significantly higher detection rate s-test dose group furthermore given objective nature v-test may represent optimal approach confirming correct piv access child provided dose least 0.3 ml/kg administered multi-center investigation required confirm finding meantime v-test requires data analysis using computer software therefore inconvenient intraoperative use development hardware software vital addressing issue mechanism underlying change precordial doppler signal injection currently unclear earlier study presumed doppler probe detects signal created tricuspid valve movement since doppler sound often detected right parasternal area prior onset systole recent study suggested placement probe left parasternal border detects doppler signal change injection higher sensitivity right parasternal border tricuspid valve located immediately posterior sternum unlikely valve movement detected doppler probe high probability left sternal border therefore presume signal collected precordial doppler machine reflect influx blood flow right ventricle baseline doppler sound may audible right parasternal border case likely due deviation right ventricle toward right side result anatomical change atelectasis cardiac dilatation microbubbles flow right ventricle may create characteristic doppler sound velocity change enhancing doppler signal dose injected likely affect number microbubbles generated thus accounting finding higher dose associated greater detection rate change precordial doppler sound several important limitation present study acknowledged first gauge piv catheter may confounding variable smaller gauge piv may slowed injection speed resulting fewer microbubbles nevertheless randomization procedure minimized potential residual confounding effect second multiple anesthesiologist carried injection study period although research investigator instructed inject highest speed possible may variation injection speed third timing injection may exactly initiation recording either s-test v-test small time difference may source measurement bias v-test minimize bias data collection procedure specified elapsed time
