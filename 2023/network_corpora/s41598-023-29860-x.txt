introduction acute pancreatitis inflammatory disease characterized edema necrosis glandular tissue become one common acute abdominal condition clinically approximately patient may develop recurrent acute pancreatitis rap study suggested rap chronic pancreatitis pancreatic cancer may represent disease continuum recurrent attack potent risk factor progression chronic pancreatitis thereby increasing risk pancreatic cancer therefore essential establish stable quantitative prediction model predict recurrence provide precaution potential recurrence patient possibly help prevent cancer development previous study primarily focused exploring clinical risk factor predicting recurrence however simple clinical model show relatively low accuracy lack stability individual specificity due different research method clinical factor although imaging examination show good value diagnosis radiological study rap risk factor study explored influence pancreatic volume severity index pancreatic necrosis recurrence meanwhile existing prediction model include conventional morphological feature image observed doctor naked eye visualization potential subtle feature reflecting heterogeneity disease realized therefore still lack accurate quantitative indicator predict recurrence radiomics given nature texture analysis could offer insight heterogeneity lesion therefore radiomics may detect
