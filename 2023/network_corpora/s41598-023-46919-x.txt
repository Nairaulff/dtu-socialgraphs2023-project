introduction country around world implemented lockdown non-pharmaceutical intervention prevent spread coronavirus reducing contact people japan february request close school issued local government april 7th state emergency declared seven prefecture including tokyo april 16th expanded include japan declaring state emergency prime minister abe called people reduce contact others work home instead office principle unlike lockdown united state europe japan declaration state emergency doe legally binding effect doe impose punishment fine arrest disregard restriction however many people refrained going company organization also forced change accelerated introduction remote work one way ensure safety employee continuing business activity due declaration state emergency remote work implementation rate company increased 17.6 declaration 56.4 percentage people implemented remote work full-time employee increased 13.2 declaration 27.9 remote work also referred telework telecommuting refers employee using information communication technology ict work location office many mean working home also encompasses working outside traditional office concept remote work new around since 1970s remote work developed step development ict term computer internet covid-19 pandemic suddenly accelerated trend many study reported benefit remote work remote work generally increase productivity job satisfaction key increased autonomy employee provides flexibility choosing working hour facilitates finding work-life balance addition perspective company environment promotion remote work lower cost allows reduce office space maintain competitiveness competition acquire human resource reduce traffic volume environmental pollution hand disadvantage remote work also reported decrease satisfaction productivity increase working hour one reason seemingly contradictory result lie ambivalence remote work example remote work increase work flexibility simultaneously increase feeling loneliness weakens human network within company especially case semi-forced transition remote work due covid-19 pandemic first-time experience employee almost preparation time fact wanted transition remote work therefore clear order continue enjoy benefit remote work necessary focus thing directly measured output productivity also maintaining employee motivation happiness study relationship remote-work frequency employee satisfaction reported employee satisfaction level highest frequency remote work order promote remote work practically necessary consider advantage disadvantage also consider countermeasure impediment implementation study organized survey actual situation remote work covid-19 pandemic japan showed reason introducing implementing remote work greatly influenced three factor job suitable remote work remote work system developed remote work environment developed. obstacle include lack space remote work home employee perspective difficulty

number working people decreased office district increased residential district change office component began around march news regarding covid-19 began appear japan accelerated first state emergency declaration since gradually returned pre-pandemic level although repeated peak trough occurred due spread infection declaration state emergency exception 2nd wave 8th wave kanto area infection spread number people working office district decreased number people working residential district increased however time passed since start pandemic fluctuation become sensitive spread infection kanto area change since 7th wave avated response 8th wave even kansai area 7th wave abated change level slight response 8th wave second wave infection momentum return pre-pabdemic level weakened end first wave number people working office district decrease thought due fact government declare state emergency implemented policy called goto campaign promote travel dining result people sense crisis regarding

correlation kanto area total amount corporate capital return ratio office component pre- post-covid-19 pandemic individual corporation level factor whether corporation introduced remote work whether business type suitable remote work considered large impact however general trend confirmed number working people decreased many corporation large capital gather line trend obtained past questionnaire survey implementation rate remote work higher large corporation small medium-sized corporation capital size exceeds certain line 10^ 5.5 return rate doe exceed 1.0 hand correlation could confirmed kansai area fig show adoption remote work advanced kansai area kanto area therefore considered insufficient difference make correlation significant pre- post-covid-19 pandemic study made possible quantitatively ass state prevalence remote work area-by-area basis going beyond previous limitation relying survey understand overall trend result study considered valuable data decision-making urban development infrastructure investment disaster preparedness area significant change observed office component office district residential district may implication various aspect commuter traffic volume train occupancy rate rush hour electricity usage demand dining establishment network traffic volume office vacancy rate instance increase people working home could lead decrease electricity usage dining establishment office district simultaneously increasing demand residential district moreover individual conduct online meeting home may increase network traffic downloading also uploading residential district previously lower daytime traffic additionally area higher concentration large-capital company tend lower return rate office component suggesting central business district numerous large enterprise may experience increase office vacancy rate furthermore seen fig identified office district study seen increase office component compared pre-covid-19 period others witnessed decrease varying return rate data provide essential insight informed decision-making various aspect urban development emergency planning point attributed change office component impact remote work however important acknowledge possibility company much like school closed may suspended regular operation covid-19 pandemic especially state emergency legally binding request made non-essential worker refrain going office commercial facility suspend operation therefore change office component solely attributed remote work nevertheless even state emergency ended office component return pre-pandemic level continued fluctuate response wave infection suggests least change due remote work especially sixth wave omicron variant emerged infection rapidly increased significant change office component observed even absence state emergency may indicate remote work become firmly established allowing flexible adjustment work arrangement response evolving infection situation furthermore result correlation analysis area capital size return ratio suggests flexibility likely area larger capital size mentioned introduction remote work offer various advantage become important factor job seeker choosing place employment especially among younger generation japan job market significant difference job opening-to-applicants ratio small medium-sized enterprise capital million yen fewer employee large enterprise job opening-to-applicants ratio large enterprise generally fall 1.0 small medium-sized enterprise range around time much time depending year remote work continues prevalent larger company number job seeker aspire work large company may increase future although adoption rate remote work higher larger company even smaller company implemented remote work proportion experiencing benefit implementation equal higher larger company therefore considered desirable small medium-sized enterprise actively transition remote work role applied finally discus limitation study future work mentioned earlier important note change office component state emergency attributed solely remote work next study using edinet code list hsgs one japanese domestic corporation submitting annual security report selected office district however small portion approximately 3.67 million japanese corporation filed annual security report even corporation submitting annual security report office head office considered may case corporate headquarters exists residential area case even number people office decreasing due prevalence remote work may offset increase residential area using broader detailed database corporate office may possible clarify relationship prevalence remote work considering capital size also factor number corporation number employee type business furthermore study defined office district residential district analysis make practical use result necessary focus delve finer detail change spatial distribution working people including difference characteristic office component increased decreased addition study focused office component clarify prevalence remote work future work may able clarify broadly life pattern people changed due covid-19 pandemic also focusing commercial downtown component
