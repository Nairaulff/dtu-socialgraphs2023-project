introduction popularity soccer among child adolescent steadily increasingworldwide however concern arise sport specialization heightened training load external pressure coach parent various biomedical factor potentially impede holistic development young athlete research team along numerous researcher delved adverse ramification intense soccer practice main concern appear include sport burnout musculoskeletal injury notably significant number young athlete terminate sporting endeavor around age injury peaking around year age among soccer player osgood-schlatter disease osd stand one prevalent non-traumatic knee injury among highly active child adolescent despite recognition century precise etiology osd remains elusive currently theory widely accepted researcher suggests prolonged and/or repetitive stress patellar tendon may contribute osd reason could strong forceful pull traction force quadriceps muscle patellar tendon apophysis anterior part tibial tuberosity additionally natural progression change puberty may also influence onset osd duration symptom osd varies across study minimum duration pain reported week last month reported case pain lasted much longer—a year even year even treatment intervention symptom may remain individual rathleff showed positive effect decreased symptom subject week month activity modification knee strengthening intervention conversely krause showed patient osd treated conservatively experienced complete resolution symptom within approximately year symptom onset although deficit strength knee function persisted much

press—peak power output test offer insight overall lower limb power production whereas single leg countermovement jump single leg hop distance test focus unilateral power dynamic scenario test together provide multifaceted perspective lower limb power capturing range relevant movement pattern intensity robustness comparability result within broader scientific context ensured established validity previous research moreover situation knee ankle range motion quadriceps muscle flexibility result selected range motion test chosen judiciously comprehensively ass relevant joint mobility weight bearing lunge test wblt specifically evaluated ankle dorsiflexion range motion crucial parameter various weight-bearing activity additionally ely test employed gauge knee range motion providing insight flexibility functional capacity knee joint test collectively offered comprehensive evaluation joint mobility pertinent study population established validity prior research ensures reliability comparability finding within broader scientific context significant difference wblt osd-h control group absence deficit range dorsiflexion considered positive aspect group due fact aforementioned limitation considered risk factor anterior knee pain quadriceps muscle function eccentrically running propulsion phase commences point knee reach maximum level flexion therefore shortened quadriceps muscle may play role development osd knee rom quadriceps flexibility evaluated using ely test conclusively group demonstrated comparable quadriceps flexibility result study finding inconsistent study lucena total participant aged 12–15 year studied osd presented decrease quadriceps flexibility difference outcome compared mentioned study may due different test adapted thomas test versus ely test evaluates quadriceps flexibility range motion power lower limb variable may influenced fact osd-h group player reported undergoing rehabilitation information questionnaire conservative treatment included among thing element manual therapy exercise included work improve range motion lower limb strength study indirectly sought evaluate asymmetry assessed variable lower limb range motion power interestingly result revealed significant difference group aligns observed bilateral incidence osd doe entirely correlate higher incidence pain non-dominant supporting lower limb within osd-h group worth noting preliminary study therefore certain limitation firstly conclusion drawn result extrapolated practical implication assessor blinded increase risk bias additionally participant solely soccer player possible make comprehensive comparison result study including athlete various sport study participant trained played match artificial surface necessary objectively evaluate difference playing surface additionally future study must incorporate biomechanical analysis lower extremity understand implication playing artificial surface result obtained study useful large-scale cross-sectional randomized trial conclusion preliminary finding indicate 13-year-old football player commonly develop osd affect limb cause severe pain non-dominant one athlete previously experienced osd 1–4 year ago reported deficiency function sport recreational activity quality life exhibiting symptom pain koos scale significant between-group difference muscle power lower limb knee ankle range motion angle finding may corroborate previous research indicating osd history could adversely affect function sport engagement quality life teenager long term preliminary result study allow future randomized controlled trial investigate impact conservative treatment intervention osd
