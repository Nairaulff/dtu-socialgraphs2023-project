introduction obstructive sleep apnea osa common disorder prevalence 9–37 men 4–50 woman characterized repetitive upper airway obstruction sleep hypoxia hypercapnia event activate sympathetic nervous system eventually lead various disease including cardiovascular metabolic neurologic psychological problem thus appropriate treatment essential prevention various morbidity associated osa positive airway pressure pap therapy standard first-line treatment osa especially patient moderate severe osa improves patient quality life excessive daytime sleepiness various morbidity experience many patient osa complain morning headache outpatient clinic several clinical study reported prevalence morning headache patient osa 15.2 consider prevalence morning headache general population 5–7 suggested osa morning headache significantly associated furthermore number patient osa accompanied morning headache reported improvement headache pap therapy however causal relationship various sleep apnea-related parameter morning headache controversial addition relief morning headache pap therapy also debatable aim study evaluate association various sleep apnea-related parameter morning headache ass morning headache improvement month pap therapy result among study participant men mean age body mass index 50.34 10.23 year 28.00 4.21 kg/m respectively prevalence morning headache study subject 53.4 62/116 pap therapy comparison severity prevalence morning headache according osa severity found severity morning headache significantly higher severe osa group mild moderate osa group furthermore prevalence morning headache also higher severe osa group mild moderate osa group however difference significant table table demographic data study subject severity prevalence morning headache according osa severity full size table compared various parameter polysomnography psg demographic according presence morning headache find difference two group however score significantly higher morning headache group table evaluation change morning headache pap therapy found prevalence morning headache significantly decreased pap therapy 53.4 16.4 moreover severity morning headache significantly decreased pap therapy evaluated group morning headache pap therapy severity morning headache significantly decreased following pap therapy 3.15 1.34 1.13 0.86 0.001 improvement morning headache observed mild moderate severe osa group particularly among patient severe sleep apnea morning headache initially severity morning headache improved pap therapy 3.20 1.41 0.95 0.71 0.001 therefore suggest improvement morning headache significantly greater headache analyzed table furthermore although statistical significance improvement headache according pap compliance observed good compliance group showed greater improvement headache 0.83 1.55 1.12 1.66 0.447 compared poor compliance group additionally analyzing whether significant correlation improvement daytime sleepiness measured epworth sleepiness scale improvement morning headache pap treatment found statistically significant correlation fig table various parameter morning headache presence full size table table improvement morning headache osa patient morning headache pap therapy full size table figure correlation coefficiency degree improvement morning headache score spearman correlation method performed evaluate relationship parameter full size image discussion study participant osa prevalence morning headache reported 53.4 various demographic polysomnographic parameter significantly differ according presence morning headache date several study reported association morning headache sleep apnea-related parameter previous large population-based study kristiansen reported average lowest oxygen saturation level sleep significantly different according presence morning headache sand also reported relationship headache oxygen desaturation moreover lovati reported better respiratory parameter higher mean oxygen saturation lower time oxygen saturation lower found among headache sufferer respect without headache consider result study hypoxia respiratory event sufficient factor explaining mechanism morning headache therefore perform evaluation reveal pathophysiologic mechanism including factor related elevated intracranial pressure consider basic research needed suggest candidate factor associated causal relationship study found daytime sleepiness significantly associated morning headache questionnaire used assessment daytime sleepiness 0–24 point sum scale number reflects analysis mean score 10.90 5.45 morning headache presence group 8.13 4.27 morning headache absence group recently kristoffersen reported increased associated higher headache frequency addition kim also reported prevalence higher among subject chronic tension-type headache tth tth higher frequency intensity headache without also reported disabling condition caused poor nocturnal sleep lead daytime dysfunction significantly associated tth exacerbation thus considered patient morning headache also experience treatment may helpful improving morning headache according recommendation standard practice committee board director aasm continuous pap indicated improving self-reported sleepiness patient osa recommendation grade suggested standard according definition recommendation term standard reflects high degree clinical certainty generally implies use level evidence therefore considered pap therapy might also improve morning headache assessed change morning headache pap therapy knowledge study largest study compared morning headache pap therapy among patient osa herein found prevalence severity morning headache significantly improved pap therapy several study reported improvement headache pap therapy patient osa goksan reported among patient treated pap therapy morning headache totally resolved patient month treatment furthermore johnson also performed retrospective study patient osa concluded treating osa pap therapy improves headache patient also found another study concluded pap therapy alone improve headache however author also mentioned study sample size fairly small thus investigation needed study several limitation first owing retrospective nature study could find association morning headache could determine causal relationship morning headache could suggest pathophysiologic mechanism underlying morning headache thus additional basic study including cytokine genetic analysis study subject needed provide valuable data topic second evaluated morning headache among subject osa found morning headache always associated osa furthermore according international classification headache disorder third edition sleep apnea-related headache classified separately morning headache retrospective design study sufficient data characteristic headache diagnosis sleep apnea-related headache consider assessment performed using sleep apnea-related headache criterion might found association various psg parameter therefore conduct additional prospective study various psg parameter sleep apnea-related headache third due majority participant male study statistical analysis based gender difference could performed however previous study reported incidence morning headache twice high woman compared men therefore important always consider gender difference interpreting result study conclusion morning headache common symptom patient osa herein severity higher severe osa group mild moderate osa group although could find association morning headache various psg parameter subjective daytime sleepiness significantly associated morning headache found short-term pap therapy improve morning headache adult patient osa moreover improve severity morning headache patient severe osa therefore patient osa complain morning headache pap therapy may used fundamental treatment modality reduce need medication method participant retrospectively
