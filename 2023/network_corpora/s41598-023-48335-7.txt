introduction physical activity crucial modifiable factor influence long-term physical function also life expectancy survivor stroke acute phase increasing early mobilization hospitalization contribute improved functional outcome post-stroke previous study using behavior mapping monitor individual stroke every min showed spent time either resting bed sitting bed stroke care unit recent investigation 24-h activity stroke care unit 1st week post-stroke employing accelerometer demonstrated majority day spent engaging sedentary behavior energy expenditure 1.5 metabolic equivalent mets provide effective rehabilitation individual acute stroke identifying individual factor associated acute phase crucial although stroke survivor living community generally lower healthy older individual consensus exists increasing stroke offer health benefit reduces stroke recurrence recent review reported strongly associated physical function community-dwelling stroke survivor therefore hypothesizing motor function paralysis muscle composition might affect acute post-stroke period however remains unclear individual patient factor associated acute phase medical issue often hinder compensation relies medical staff high level pre-stroke linked reduced stroke severity improved long-term functional outcome although stroke severity factor directly related functional outcome higher pre-stroke associated better long-term outcome even corrected stroke severity onset word stroke includes factor improve outcome addition reducing stroke severity higher acute phase stroke lead enhanced functional outcome pre-stroke promotes post-stroke relationship pre-stroke long-term functional outcome could clarified accurately however study examined relationship pre- post-stroke acute phase study aimed investigate relationship post-stroke sedentary behavior acute phase patient characteristic pre-stroke physical function stroke onset musculoskeletal status admission hypothesized
