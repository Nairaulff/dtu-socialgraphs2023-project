introduction dental implant routine part dentistry support dental prosthesis replace missing teeth restorative purpose occurrence peri-implant disease increasing biological complication peri-implant infection leading cause dental implantation failure peri-implantitis common complication characterized inflammation tissue plaque accumulation around dental implant prevalence varied ranging 4.7 patient level various diagnostic criterion peri-implantitis usually display acute inflammatory status following peri-implant mucositis destructively affect soft hard tissue resulting progressive loss supporting bone various factor may increase risk developing peri-implantitis including systematic factor e.g smoking disease oral-related factor e.g cleaning skill periodontitis keratinized mucosa occlusal overload implant-related factor e.g implant surface position design implant-abutment junction surgical procedure fixation type treatment peri-implantitis remove biofilm critical longevity
