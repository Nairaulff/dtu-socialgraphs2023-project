introduction resource developer involved biodiversity conservation raised numerous concern extraction seafloor mineral one resource seafloor massive sulfide associated deep-sea hydrothermal vent however chemosynthetic environment hydrothermal ecosystem fostered endemic fauna also potential target conservation vent community studied extensively marine fauna near hydrothermal vent field received little attention comparison exploitation likely release suspended particle heavy metal affect vent community also fauna near hydrothermal vent field directly associated hereafter referred near-vent organism potential effect scenario still well understood achieve stable supply mineral resource country japan oil gas metal national corporation jogmec exploring extraction resource including environmental impact assessment mining activity previous study suggested deep-sea mining may result decrease biodiversity removal habitat release toxic metal burial organism sedimentation e.g. among impact understand environmental impact exploitation jogmec started technical survey project explore massive sulfide deposit seafloor depression near okinawa southwest japan jogmec performed multiple biological physical geochemical survey accordance guidance provided international seabed authority included baseline survey collect near-vent organism okinawa trough information genetic diversity connectivity pattern i.e. determining genetic population structure useful estimating population near-vent organism community could recover impact mineral extraction megabenthos key component benthic community relatively large number study using population genetic analysis megabenthos inhabiting hydrothermal vent e.g. hydrothermal vent distribution variable distance vent far apart suggested megabenthos inhabiting hydrothermal vent considerable dispersal ability hand study population genetics near-vent organism still limited therefore understanding population structure near-vent organism combination study vent organism provides important insight formation maintenance mechanism hydrothermal ecosystem surrounding environment well assessing impact future resource exploitation

evaluate connectivity vent organism also common deep-sea biota inhabit hydrothermal vicinity near-vent organism study described genetic population structure several dominant megabenthic organism two synaphobranchid eel one decapod shrimp multiple scavenging amphipod near-vent field attracted baited trap specie attracted baited trap may make small percentage diversity area represent large majority abundance measured trawl catch synaphobranchid eel dominant component scavenging community deep sea performed genetic analysis population far-flung synaphobranchid eel population apart could detect significant differentiation either eel specie among various site indicates specie may disperse large distance several generation maintain large population synaphobranchus specie posse polycyclic ovary suggesting frequent opportunity sexual reproduction among congener would increase opportunity random mating many individual addition reported synaphobranchus kaupii show high swimming metabolic activity specie even found abundance different ocean basin thus strategy life history may serve increase genetic exchange among population deep-sea shrimp also often attracted baited camera collected

among specie often affected population history e.g future study movement pattern either swimming passive larval dispersal would useful explain population structure identified study study mainly used coi sequence clarify basic information genetic population structure organism near hydrothermal vent field important however cautious interpreting result numerous study based result conclusion coi sequence including deep-sea specie genetic marker chose variable commonly used coastal marine organism future study analysis using highly variable genetic marker microsatellites single nucleotide polymorphism e.g mig-seq used study used detect detailed population structure highly polymorphic marker already used deep-sea amphipod hoped similar analysis applied near-vent amphipod study future information genetic connectivity would essential assessing environmental impact mineral mining around hydrothermal vent well determine potential location deep-sea marine protected area although trial conducted infer community resilience hydrothermal vent considering dispersal network connectivity data supporting dispersal network still limited thus necessary accumulate connectivity data
