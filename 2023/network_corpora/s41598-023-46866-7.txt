tobacco smoke component repairing oxidative dna lesion induced smoke carcinogen form basis risk allele determination summarized probable impact risk allele gene function contributing toward lung carcinogenesis among smoker supplementary material table s28 earlier genome-wide association study gwas shown rs10849605 rad52 significantly associated increased risk lung cancer data found significant association rs3748523 rad52 increased risk lung cancer implicating collinearity study gene function lung cancer first report regulatory polymorphism aldh3b1 significantly altering lung cancer risk regulating detoxification potential enzyme however pms1 gene show association lung cancer caucasian however lack association rs5742926 pms1 study could attributed sample size due low minor allele frequency eastern indian population worth mentioning rs3748523 rad52 gene associated lung cancer low smoker young age indicates potential role variant reducing expression dna repair gene conferring early risk lung cancer individual low medium smoking intensity earlier report indicated association tobacco betel quid chewing lung cancer interestingly rs3764821 aldh3b1 rs3748523 rad52 associated lung cancer tobacco betel quid chewer risk genotype polymorphism would cause ineffective metabolism xenobiotics tobacco betel quid sub-optimal dna repair dna damage caused constant xenobiotic load thus combinatorial inheritance risk allele snp would confer higher risk developing lung cancer stratifying genotype based tumor subtypes tnm staging improved risk assessment prediction risk specific tumor subtypes cancer stage lead design targeted early detection prevention strategy moreover identifying histotype-associated snp may define mechanism underlying unknown origin morphological variation contribute personalized treatment approach subtype-specific lung cancer case present study also evaluated role two lung cancer-associated regulatory polymorphic variant survival lung cancer patient treated platinum-based chemotherapy none variant showed improvement overall survival patient post-treatment standard platinum-based chemotherapy however risk allele polymorphic variant found significantly lower overall survival lung cancer patient post platinum-based chemotherapy adjusted covariates like age sex pack-years smoking found significant reduction patient risk allele rs3764821 aldh3b1 treated gemcitabine-cis/carboplatin second line treatment paclitaxel-cis/carboplatin could due lower expression aldh3b1 cause inadequate response platinum-based chemotherapy leading higher systemic toxicity increased mortality among advanced-stage iiib nsclc patient sample population best knowledge first study report role cis-regulatory polymorphic variant modulating overall survival eastern india lung cancer patient post-treatment standard chemotherapy therefore aldh3b1 rad52 play pivotal role tobacco smoke-induced lung carcinogenesis platinum-based standard chemotherapy could critical prognostic marker disease predictor chemotherapy response aldehyde dehydrogenase including aldh3b1 involved detoxification clearance chemotherapeutic drug leading chemotherapy resistance similarly rad52 dna-binding protein repair single-strand dna break introduced genotoxic compound tobacco smoke lower expression gene would imply impaired detoxification tobacco smoke metabolite repair dna damage introduced tobacco smoke metabolite influencing overall survival efficacy chemotherapy regimen different drug combination limitation approach difficulty getting necessary sample size given relative rarity many histological subtypes lack proper clinical record however data mining approach prior knowledge disease etiology helped prioritize relevant snvs replication even small sample size furthermore due lack high-resolution hic chia-pet datasets lung tissue detailed analysis physical interaction cis-elements particularly promoter-enhancer/repressors could done co-occurrence risk allele estimation unweighted genetic risk score ugrs prioritized rsnps provided insight individual population-specific tobacco-dependent lung cancer preponderance risk

attributed increase tobacco smoking aging predisposed population however stratification based larger geospatial population genome data european high risk tobacco smoke-dependent lung carcinogenesis substantiated epidemiological report lung cancer rate showed 20-fold variation stratified region predominantly reflects decrease pattern tobacco exposure including intensity duration smoking type

finland united state netherlands australia new zealand singapore germany uruguay recent report european country revealed decline age-standardized 35–64 year incidence lung cancer bulgaria exception therefore susceptible tobacco-dependent lung cancer european probably managed reduce disease load changing lifestyle habit showcase importance work towards identifying risk population designing effective tobacco control policy reduce lung cancer incidence epidemiological report corroborate finding latinos/non-white hispanic lowest risk tobacco smoke-dependent lung cancer among population genome data followed african despite high smoking rate lung cancer incidence pretty low central south american latinos/ non-white hispanic population future study would try corroborate weighted
