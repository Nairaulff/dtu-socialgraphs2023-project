addition testosterone converted estradiol aromatization bind estrogen receptor participates physiological regulation bone cartilage fig decreased testosterone level affect cartilage metabolism androgen receptor ion channel also cause decrease estradiol conversion leading cartilage degeneration koa.furthermore controversial whether estrogen level human directly mediate pathophysiology sower
