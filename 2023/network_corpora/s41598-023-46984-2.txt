introduction judo grappling olympic combat sport characterized dynamic high-intensity intermittent action requires complex skill development tactical excellence success judo athlete classified according body mass order assure opponent similar body size strength agility however attempt compete lighter potentially smaller weaker adversary judo athlete use various method manipulate body mass qualify lower weight category obtain competitive advantage rapid weight loss rwl involves swiftly decreasing significant amount body mass within short duration often pursued align specific weight category criterion competitive event rwl usually begin week leading competition highest amount body mass reduced last day reduction achieved using aggressive nutritional physiological method influence fluid-electrolyte turnover whole-body water balance study investigating prevalence rwl among judo athlete revealed extremely high value reaching judo athlete participating world ranking competition considered common method used athlete sauna bathing wearing plastic clothing fluid caloric restriction intake diuretic laxative shortly athlete intentionally reduce body mass meet specific weight category requirement initiate rapid weight regain rwg strategy following official weigh-in resulting swift considerable increase body mass interestingly shown recently catabolic hormonal reaction occurred calorie restriction maintained rwg intervention rwl significantly decrease testosterone thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration among muay thai fighter additionally restoration rwg process observed moreover mentioned hormonal modulation may affect behavioral change self-confidence fighting motivation competition anxiety mental toughness strategy also potentially lead diminished physical performance also cause health risk especially considered young judo athlete also engage practice severe case death reported athlete using rwl procedure likely due heat stress dehydration hyperthermia thus safety reason change weight control program combat sport suggest several time national collegiate athletic association ncaa initiated new rule prevent resulting rwl tragedy checking athlete hydration status time weight certification author reported decreased rwl procedure rapid weight gain wrestler international judo federation ijf also introduced change weigh-in rule changing official weigh-in day competition introducing random weigh-in competition day allowing judo athlete upper-limit weight category therefore considering new rule judo athlete likely began select optimal strategy reduce body mass official weigh-in recover much possible limit however little known regarding impact new rule rwl rwg hydration status judo athlete day approaching competition weigh-in competition far one study found investigating hydration status judo athlete according new weigh-in rule author measured hydration status eight judo athlete one week official weigh-in post-competition reported athlete reduced 6.8 body mass one week official weigh-in increased 4.2 body mass official weigh-in post-competition also reported significant difference urine specific gravity official weigh-in 1.030 0.001 post-competition 1.017 0.007 indicating still dehydrated post-competition however important emphasize study conducted judo athlete include measurement competition day therefore study higher sample size measurement competition day needed thus purpose present study examine effect new ijf rule rwl rwg hydration status judo athlete national competition well performance hypothesized even extended time achieve body mass required rule would ensure safe application rwl/rwg strategy moreover dehydration often accompanies rapid weight loss due limited fluid intake exposure heat would affect

5-days competition compared 1-day 10-h competition higher competition day compared 1-day 10-h weigh-in however uosm usg vary period measurement significantly correlated 0.68 conversely percentage match correlate significantly body mass uosm usg variable fact athlete present study used rwl strategy similar recent finding judo athlete taking part competition judo world ranking system i.e. higher previously reported weigh-in conducted day competition i.e. high prevalence athlete using rwl strategy may due weigh-in rule change allow athlete recover 15–17 instead usual 3–4 allowed thus likely judo athlete felt could recover within time period especially body mass tolerance provided additionally judo athlete may observed high percentage athlete using rwl using would result disadvantage competition perception using rwl may result competitive advantage cascade effect already observed criticized author however magnitude rwl conducted judo athlete present study similar observed study slightly study available analyzing body mass change international level judo athlete along rwl competition amount reduction probably related two aspect weight category judo present nearly increment body mass thus athlete middle two weight category limit prone reduce body mass instead trying increase per rule athlete weight category upper-limit day competition therefore reducing nearly fact compete walking weight however important consider present study body mass measurement conducted day competition competition athlete may started reduce body mass period conversely 17.6 judo athlete declared would participate tournament heavier weight category official weigh-in conducted day competition suggesting athlete decision regarding using rwl procedure affected moment weigh-in method used athlete sample similar previously reported judo athlete different country investigation observed older athlete coach among influential people regarding practice rwl judo athlete seems use method passed generation athlete therefore educational program aim increasing athlete coach parent awareness nutritional strategy healthier way properly manage body mass reduction regain weigh-in indeed athlete reported oriented registered dietitian higher compared study however advice expert usually ended body mass reduction without specific intervention regarding rehydration weigh-in competition day reflected survey consequence lack education concerning aspect judo athlete started competition dehydrated condition still dehydrated end event athlete study reported drinking fluid thirst seems physical psychological stress competition day made athlete ignore sign dehydration thirst moreover intense exercise heavy clothing like warming wearing judogi judo suit sportswear cause progressive reduction plasma volume fact uosm usg change period measurement indicate judo athlete investigated either constantly mildly dehydrated started body mass reduction day competition independently reason absence change variable important emphasize athlete dehydrated along time-points analyzed i.e. even competition day allowed recover body mass even though recovered amount body mass recovered athlete present study similar reported recent study analyzing international-level judo athlete post-competition 4.2 study however judo athlete presented lower usg 24-h post-competition compared weigh-in measurement thus additional 24-h given study ceylan may contributed higher re-hydration correlation found body mass uosm usg variable percentage match differs study reale al. found body mass regain higher medal winner non-medal winner male female judo athlete male however author observe difference body mass regain first round match even though winner higher body mass regain loser match considered fact judo athlete present study recovered double body mass compared athlete analyzed reale al. 1.5 male sample suggest basically body mass competition thus low variation 3.1 4.7 observed athlete study small affect competitive performance however small sample present study limitation determine influence rwl rwg judo competitive performance considering high prevalence rwl observed study method used rwl process important athlete coach competition manager educated regarding effective scientifically-based approach weight management control program suggested artioli implemented study without limitation firstly small sample size applied secondly study focused solely male participant thirdly absence control group non-rwl restricts comprehensive analysis however enlarging sample size incorporating female athlete present notable challenge study conducted major national sport competition athlete subjected multitude factor might impact performance result tend hesitant participating experiment furthermore due variation menstrual cycle timing often disrupted extreme training load influence hormonal change regulating fluid balance body mass studying female athlete becomes even complex nevertheless future experiment consider increasing sample size including female athlete well comparing rwl non-rwl group conclusion conclusion finding indicated judo athlete applied rwl procedure using traditional method achieve body mass required i.e. increased exercise reduced fluid food intake resulting dehydration status day competition competition day however rwl rwg associated competitive performance moreover athlete coach educated regarding effective scientifically-based approach body mass management control program also minimize risk excessive dehydration potential health
