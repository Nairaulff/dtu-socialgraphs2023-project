introduction stroke leading cause death disability worldwide recent decade considerable improvement stroke care effective evidence-based treatment intravenous thrombolysis thrombectomy care stroke unit time acute intervention crucial factor stroke care knowledge resulted awareness importance early recognition stroke symptom rapid transport hospital stroke alert optimisation in-hospital stroke care pathway workflow however stroke patient ineligible acute intervention therefore considered stroke alert historical care pathway transfer patient via emergency department admission stroke unit study shown environment complex entail patient safety risk reported frequent cause adverse event related human error crowding patient awaiting care high workload combination lack communication skill among staff negative factor also occur prehospital setting routine fully implemented wide variation concerning professional adherence prehospital guideline adherence guideline sometimes low stroke patient immobile often elderly higher risk complication pressure ulcer challenge throughout world considered adverse event incidence prevalence indicator quality care around world considerable variation observed different clinical setting geographical area sweden hospital-acquired rate another complication falling common potentially deleterious consequence stroke patient safety situation isolated problem also influenced happening preceding part care pathway system prolonged waiting time due lack admission patient ward problematic condition mean staff across care pathway involved protecting patient adverse event trying speed process care pathway leaving environment interprofessional team care stroke unit proven beneficial example unit provides early screening dysphagia take preventive action pneumonia addition patient treated stroke unit likelier alive independent home effort decrease number patient referred minimise time spent decrease patient safety risk promote rapid transport stroke unit therefore effort important acute stroke care action early 2000s university hospital western sweden fast track developed suspected stroke patient meet criterion acute intervention fast track involved patient suspicion stroke directly transported stroke unit intention shorten time care pathway reduce health-associated harm use common resource efficiently early evaluation showed fast track process associated relatively high diagnostic accuracy term stroke-related diagnosis markedly decreased time delay initial contact arrival stroke unit however safety potential benefit patient needed confirmed larger study concomitant evaluation clinical consequence also highlighted health-related quality life qol using patient reported outcome measurement aim present study thus describe outcome related patient safety stroke patient considered eligible acute intervention still transported via fast track directly stroke unit compare patients´ outcome outcome patient considered

discussion present study aim describe outcome related patient safety stroke patient considered eligible acute intervention still transported via fast track directly stroke unit compare patients´

month admission stroke unit number denied fast track increased main reason accepted lack available patient bed stroke unit may explain slightly patient accepted fast track evening p.m. p.m. since discharge inpatient often take place later day free hospital bed previously reported staff frequently met message unaccepted fast track described reluctance feeling giving resulted even trying initiate fast track likely one reason decreasing number contact hospital stroke coordinator likely reason improvement treatment option increased time window acute intervention resulting patient eligible acute intervention therefore transported via another fast track process stroke alert directly computer tomography consideration reperfusion treatment study indicated professional adherence prehospital guideline varies greatly compliance guideline sometimes low prehospital setting patient nurse tried involve fast track match predefined criterion probably several cause one could nurse phone consulted stroke-physician accepted direct admission even though criterion met wennman found staff throughout entire care pathway cooperated flexible way sometimes outside routine order protect patient safety risk crowding delay care pathway previous study pointed environment entail patient safety risk benefit leaving environment interprofessional team care stroke unit furthermore study shown risk complication especially stroke patient pneumonia fall pus—a complication often occurs hospital therefore study result –showing significant difference group predefined outcome events—was unexpected however since present study population consisted selected group stroke patient relatively low severity difficult compare result general data describing entire population present study low frequency post-stroke pneumonia 2.3 systematic review badve concluded stroke patient experience pneumonia acute period hospital care furthermore incidence fall reported –22 hospitalisation compared 9.7 present study prevalence 3.7 also lower present study overall data sweden hospital-acquired rate fact frequency pneumonia fall lower study others could explained high quality stroke care selection low risk stroke patient although study show significant difference group control mean time spent transport stroke unit long min prehospital data showed main cause transport lack availability hospital bed situation long-term trend 2000–2018 across europe oecd data show number hospital bed per caput declining although situation partly explained increased possibility diagnostics clinical care leading efficient use hospital resource sweden stand regarding number hospital bed among oecd-countries sweden almost lowest number hospital bed per population 3.7 lowest number 2.1 moreover sweden mean time spent tends increasing according national statistic known except suddenly suffering serious illness critical health related transition long time spent associated low patient satisfaction improve patient turnover release hospital bed feedback system hospital bed capacity control system proven remedy however beveridge-like health care system like one sweden remedy either rare insufficient sweden slow hospital throughput known effect staff shortage poor incentive improve bed capacity standardized fixed salary swedish tax financed public health may contribute bed-blocking minimized patient turnover hospital bed improved personal incentive among nurse clinician may pave way solution crowding issue hand patient experience positively associated patient safety clinical effectiveness swedish patient law patient safety refers health-associated harm suffering bodily psychological injury illness death could avoided sufficient measure taken patient contact healthcare system therefore patient safety fast track process stroke unit studied light psychological bodily suffering strength limitation strength study relatively large sample size fact study population recruited well-defined area limited number hospital department additionally data merged several high-quality register made possible retrieve objective outcome subjective patient-reported outcome major weakness retrospective design fact study population randomised two group study population based ems-nurses ability ass stroke symptom willingness contact hospital coordinator adherence guideline could affect representatively another weakness could data aggregated included three stroke unit data collected several part care pathway inherent risk missing data multiplicity documenting system probably one reason relatively high proportion missing value variable conclusion difference detected predefined patient safety outcome stroke patient spent mean time almost referred stroke unit patient admitted directly stroke unit indicates fast track stroke unit safe selected stroke patient could avoid non-valuable time large-scale randomised study could strengthen conclusion
