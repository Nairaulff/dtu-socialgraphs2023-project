introduction importance air travel facilitating long-distance spread covid-19 undisputed example well established citizen returning mainland europe e.g italy spain france rather china primarily responsible initially introducing sars-cov-2 based sequencing estimated least independently-introduced transmission lineage virus introduced early leading first wave covid-19 based estimate infected passenger entering represented 0.02 million passenger arriving period however notably lower estimated 1.3 infected international passenger left wuhan start pandemic fuelled global spread disease beginning second covid-19 wave europe in-flight transmission sars-cov-2 passenger also documented flight greece ireland attack rate 10–17 transmission occurred despite use face covering implementation social distancing measure range modelling epidemiological case study also confirmed one infected person flight could transmit disease passenger throughout plane helped close proximity passenger intrinsic air circulation pattern closely confined high frequency use toilet facility potential importing transmitting sars-cov-2 aircraft mirror finding respiratory viral disease e.g influenza addition potential transmission within crowded airport terminal also demonstrated respiratory pathogen e.g adenovirus suggesting single individual carrying disease may infect multiple people travelling different destination although closure international flight inevitably helped contain spread disease come substantial cost example covid-19 restriction air travel led major economic job loss many country therefore urgent drive travel industry re-open international air route post-pandemic however must done socially responsible practical economic way ensure protection public health key effective disease control surveillance clearly requires development practical cost-effective socially acceptable surveillance technology also necessitates good knowledge individual attitude covid-19 behaviour air travel one survey public acceptance quarantining measure concluded public support vital program involving quarantine isolation addressing challenge barrier enlist support public essential optimize compliance appraisal airport entry screening measure shown highly resource demanding often ineffectual although range strategy place national disease surveillance e.g contact tracing self-reporting apps targeted untargeted swab testing seroprevalence still lack way reliably estimate rate disease entry overseas traveller based known trans-national importation new variant sars-cov-2 e.g beta gamma theta omicron clear current surveillance strategy remain inadequate point departure point entry either current technology lack scientific credibility e.g thermal imaging gate cost-effective mass deployment iii subject error e.g lateral flow device swab testing fail capture recently acquired infection e.g acquired within hour departure available point departure capture infection acquired travel e.g transit lounge flight vii solely rely self-reporting fails capture asymptomatic pre-symptomatic mildly symptomatic individual knowingly concealing symptom supported ecdc study estimated infected individual china arrived destination undetected help mitigate many country implemented policy quarantining passenger 10–14 day upon arrival clearly self-quarantining relies individual compliance effective particular includes obedience and/or agreement follow quarantining police suggested obedience involves respect implicit explicit rule socially learned behaviour contrast disobedience suggested behaviour individual take conscious stance formalized law implied social norm therefore individual refuse comply quarantining policy due obedience learned behaviour

knowledge range symptom associated covid-19 mixed respondent good knowledge main symptom covid-19 e.g. fever cough shortness breath recognise symptom e.g. skin rash muscle body ache diarrhoea headache nausea vomiting lack awareness increase risk spreading covid-19 individual unable effectively self-diagnose potential covid-19 infection act appropriately mitigate spread covid-19 travelling pose particular risk early within infection point-of-departure detection technology e.g lateral flow device reliable also important high proportion individual contract covid-19 experience mild recognised symptom fig case isolation common symptom therefore vital improve public knowledge symptom medium report education shown positively alter behaviour disease outbreak instance allow people ass symptom effectively subsequently foster responsible travel behaviour pandemic however particularly challenging distinguishing covid-19 symptom common food poisoning agent e.g campylobacter salmonella viral illness e.g. rhinovirus norovirus enterovirus pharmaceutical use excessive alcohol consumption difficult evidence show free testing facility effectively alter behaviour reduce community transmission therefore highly recommend people given easy access testing facility allow individual distinguish covid-19 common illness uncertainty around symptom experienced likely compliance government strategy minimize disease spread major risk covid-19 entry lack compliance government mitigation strategy aimed reducing spread covid-19 found respondent would follow travel advice public asked travel expressing covid-19 symptom furthermore respondent would comply government self-isolation guideline upon entry understanding behaviour integral providing way health planner policy maker encourage compliance although study doe explore factor likely behaviour driven similar factor identified study focus general compliance behaviour pandemic specific travel include lack perceived risk virus financial worry e.g. understanding financial support available need work worrying supporting family social cultural pressure mental wellbeing etc in-flight covid-19 transmission risk associated passenger perception behaviour multiple factor contribute cumulative risk contracting covid-19 air travel mitigation strategy implemented internationally reduce risk spreading covid-19 air travel e.g. mandatory face covering installation hepa air filter however several risk closely aligned one perception and/or behaviour flying pandemic potential increase risk despite implemented mitigation strategy evaluating risk perception air passenger travelled covid-19 pandemic highlighted high proportion individual felt safe contracting covid-19 air travel suggests non-pharmaceutical intervention reduce disease transmission correctly practiced flight according anderson handwashing soap effective way mitigate spread infectious disease despite globally benefit hand hygiene poorly practiced particularly problematic cramped aircraft bathroom high risk cross contamination due large number touch surface additionally suen found many individual overlook actual importance washing hand hand hygiene taking part activity would required wash hand support research found participant would wash hand following recommended guideline covid-19 furthermore proposed female respondent generally better knowledge regarding hand hygiene support finding study mainly woman older participant stated would follow covid-19 recommended guideline regard washing hand recommended promoting hygiene guideline gender specific material used ensure importance hygiene whether hand hygiene hygiene general understood adopted individual sustain improvement hygiene practice gender difference covid-19 awareness risk perception agreement kamenidou found woman generally better identifying covid-19 symptom compared male participant believe previously reported difference male female men lower risk perception disbelief covid-19 contagious sense covid-19 immunity likely also contribute towards observed difference age group adult without child research support previous finding bass woman would willing adhere various level quarantine compared men furthermore research agrees galasso woman likely perceive covid-19 serious health problem making likely agree comply government guideline additionally bass found respondent older willing younger respondent stay home government guideline place also agrees finding overall finding suggest male younger age group reduced perceived personal risk contracting covid-19 result suggest pose higher risk transporting sars-cov-2 back around due lack willingness co-operate isolation guideline age difference covid-19 awareness risk perception found higher proportion older generation aged adult child able recognise covid-19 symptom compared younger age group 18–44 adult without child respectively finding suggest male young adult adult without child pose higher risk spreading covid-19 infection information need created target segmentation unique way similar finding also reported non-air traveller africa finding agreed previous research younger participant age unable identify many symptom connected covid-19 would likely pay required attention symptom appeared aforementioned study suggests younger population interested solving issue covid-19 present rather focusing prevent spread compounded negative medium representation role younger generation spreading covid-19 over-reliance social medium information suggests information need targeted segmented age group ensure correct information retained processed regard following guideline set government finding suggest younger generation likely break self-isolation guidance relative older population contrast research conducted italy ceccato found age-related difference compliance regulation however identify follow strict guideline participant confidence public health information provided finding strengthen importance delivery information also reliability information presented conclusion based national survey air passenger behavioural pattern individual perception covid-19 alongside known importation new sars-cov-2 variant conclude past current government guideline policy insufficient prevent frequent entry sars-cov-2 supported information provided english test trace welsh test trace protect programme still show high rate sars-cov-2 carriage among incoming passenger 1–7.5 total also non-compliance self-quarantining rule subsequently led major outbreak public health wale pers comm. recommendation support imposition stricter guideline ensure complete compliance point-of-departure pcr-based covid-19 testing stricter quarantining arrival citizen returning overseas limitation study confined citizen would therefore desirable repeat study evaluate perception non-uk citizen additional socioeconomic cultural barrier may prevent non-compliance enhance risk disease entry typically pre-pandemic account air traveller entering although noted subject compulsory quarantining government facility rather self-quarantining home like citizen despite well understood risk associated air travel disease transmission e.g confined space poor airflow mitigation implemented reduce risk e.g compulsory face covering highlight additional risk considered associated individual perception related behaviour towards covid-19 jeopardise existing strategy reduce spread sars-cov-2 term future pandemic work suggests despite repeated messaging national agency greater emphasis needed ensure individual understand importance following public health guideline self-imposed quarantining extended hygiene help reduce infection spread additionally presentation disease symptom main symptom onset need addressed way understood adopted individual reduce chance spreading infection different way communication also needed particularly reach younger
