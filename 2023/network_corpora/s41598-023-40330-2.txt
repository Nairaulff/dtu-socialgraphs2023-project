discussion study objective estimate lifetime care burden nsclc patient using real-world data similar estimation dalys quantification loss-of-dfle could used economic evaluation healthcare intervention cost-effectiveness analysis previous study reported tracheal bronchus lung cancer caused estimated 45.9 million dalys globally 2.26 million incident case resulting average burden approximately 20.3 year daly per person study found similar loss-of-dfle age 50–64 stage iiib–iv group nsclc patient however best knowledge like many previous study estimation predominantly relied cross-sectional approach specific time period derived consensus expert focus group sample general population living community recent research growing recognition importance cohort follow-up method rather period method achieve continuous estimation line trend study adopted longitudinal approach directly measured data nsclc patient estimate burden disability result estimate would accurately reflect potential demand long-term care among nsclc patient considering aging population advancement medical technology demand long-term care steadily increasing therefore crucial allocate appropriate resource meet care demand example taiwan annual budget long-term care grew million 2.14 billion include out-of-pocket payment patient family moreover estimation could also included counting potential benefit saved successful prevention disease societal perspective study following strength order accomplish goal first recruited nation-wide subject taiwan cancer registry interlinked national mortality registry estimate survival since every pathologically validated nsclc patient waived copayments coverage rate national health insurance nhi since diagnosed lung cancer patient would enrolled original cohort therefore sample survival estimation would comprehensive representative second year follow-up exceeds sub-cohorts except sub-cohort young age early stage table fig censored rate extrapolated period lifetime would usually long moreover extrapolation method used mortality general population namely lifetables reference guide extrapolation adopted rolling-over algorithm end follow-up estimation shown relatively accurate empirically applied several cancer study third abstracted repeatedly measured real world data qol functional disability single medical center invited lung cancer patient

used adjust survival function summed throughout life obtain qale dfle method validated simulation empirically corroborated previous study estimated dynamic function qol barthel index diagnosis nsclc

simulated taiwan national vital statistic quality life function taken taiwan national health interview survey age- sex-specific proportion disability general population abstracted taiwan national demand estimation long-term care qol disability function individually multiplied corresponding survival function estimate qale dfle referent thus tentatively conclude estimate qale dfle corresponding loss-of-le loss-of-qale loss-of-dfle would relatively accurate could applied health policy decision making table fig finally comparison methodology employed prior study evaluating health-adjusted life expectancy commonly used sullivan method study also take account specific age-specific mortality rate disability rate original method typically rely period life table due limited access cohort data study utilizes cohort life table allowing longitudinal perspective estimating dfle specific disease addition estimation dfle reference group study involves utilizing survival function derived national life table multiplied age-specific disability rate obtained nationwide long-term care database comprehensive approach enables capture disability-adjusted life expectancy general population national level consequently subtracting calculated dfle nsclc subcohorts resulting loss-of-dfle provides precise measure disease-specific impact social burden contrast conventional method using multistate lifetables many assumption parameter estimated provide simplified alternative approach directly employ real world data namely barthel index estimation health effect resulted different technology specific illness several implication policy making could inferred study first typical cancer cohort anticipate older age advanced stage would result lower dfle qale compared younger age earlier stage study however showed advanced stage larger impact older age patient nsclc individual item summed score well utility table fig moreover fig indicates bigger gap item adl early advanced stage right diagnosis usually lasted year gap young old age seemed obvious speculate might resulted deteriorated pulmonary function due lung collapse pleural effusion advanced-stage patient rather due aging second since one dimension eq-5d self-care measured detail barthel index found dfle sub-cohort almost close qale corroborates hypothesis functional disability would usually major determinant quality life including nsclc patient table third number year living disability estimated real-world data appeared small due short life expectancy nsclc fig result compatible general assumption loss-of-le loss-of-qale loss-of dfle would higher younger age group since would longer life expectancy table overall finding provide valuable insight healthcare policymakers term resource allocation development comprehensive care pathway integrate prevention diagnosis treatment long-term support cancer survivor study contributes evaluation strategy aimed improving sustainability healthcare institution reducing burden family caring non-autonomous individual limitation several limitation study must acknowledged first reference group disability based information decade ago may lead underestimation dfle care burden reference group therefore must update prevalence disability general population regularly develop fair effective policy resource allocation second although tried consider many comorbidities possible account possible functional disability measurement usually comprehensive nckuh sample recorded nhi database nckuh medical center able abstract diagnosis medical record however nhi currently allows major diagnosis data recorded clinic diagnosis data collected hospital reimbursement nevertheless possibility factor would affect functional disability blindness amputation usually low thus result would biased much third patient nsclc usually die within year number patient still eligible adl measurement usually decrease time confidence limit would become wider however estimation adjusted survival rate time point multiplying survival function disability proportion potential bias life expectancy would negligible fourth since direct adl measurement data national database data collected nckuh integrated national survival data calculate dfle representativeness hospital cohort would concern patient lung cancer recruited mostly outpatient clinic generally younger better performance status baseline comorbid cardiovascular disease table nsclc patient poorer ecog performance higher odds moderate severe mobility disability compared slight disability study could underestimated overall impact disease namely loss-of-qale loss-of-dfle fourth usual life expectancy female lung cancer patient would longer compared male however due smaller sample size available quality life disability assessment stratify gender group analyzing qale dfle therefore aimed focus differentiating potential effect age versus advanced stage lung cancer limited data future study warranted recruit larger sample size one would able stratify estimation gender accurately lastly since extrapolation method employed study relied heavily real-world data generally requires sufficiently long follow-up period achieve certain level accuracy typically period range year depending specific disease therefore factor data accessibility accuracy duration follow-up may limit feasibility estimation method country conclusion study reveals significant decrease dfle among survivor nsclc particularly younger individual diagnosed advanced stage functional disability emerges key determinant nsclc patient quality life impacting dfle qale recognizing anticipated rise long-term care demand associated functional disability imperative address societal burden future health technology assessment study finding highlight importance enhancing cancer prevention policy treatment long-term management specific focus functional health nsclc survivor research across diverse
