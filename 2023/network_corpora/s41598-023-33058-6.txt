introduction preprints health science relatively short tradition compared field e.g. physic mathematics biology researcher using preprint server since 1990s distribute research finding idea founding medical preprint server medrxiv www.medrxiv.org june preprints entered field medical health research server popularity dramatically increased coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic boosted use day many journal e.g. elsevier springer plo one lancet introduced preprint policy allows even encourages sharing preprints prior peer-reviewed publication funding agency wellcome permit researcher cite preprints grant application addition encouraging preprint posting even require preprints shared widely rapidly result significant public health benefit indeed early fast dissemination appealing feature preprints quick research sharing enables researcher build early result accelerating research effort necessary overcome pressing health issue concern however circumventing peer-review process lead increase amount scientifically invalid work preprints cited widely press without communicating proper caution risk finding exaggerated medium better-quality work could ignored according study
