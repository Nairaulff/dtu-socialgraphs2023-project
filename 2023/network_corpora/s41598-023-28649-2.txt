introduction sjögren syndrome autoimmune disease characterized dry mouth dry eye believed caused complex relationship immune abnormality female hormone secretion heredity however exact cause disease yet clarified multiple clinical test employed diagnosis one commonly used oral examination saxon test involves quantitative observation saliva determine oral dryness however recent year presence covid-19 virus saliva made difficult conduct saliva test evaluation oral condition therefore necessary develop objective method evaluating oral condition common symptom include dry mouth pain tongue fissure tongue discoloration tongue due oral candidiasis moreover dermoscopic study revealed difference appearance structure color tongue surface may important marker diagnosis feature tongue color
