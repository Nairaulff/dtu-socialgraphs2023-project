introduction atlantic forest natural habitat euterpe edulis endangered palm specie biogeographically distributed across brazilian coast sea level altitude steep slope dry forest edulis slow-growing specie single-stemmed regrowth capacity natural occurrence dependent well-preserved forest palm specie provides important non-timber forest product ntfp exploited brazilian atlantic forest hotspot palm heart extraction occurs cutting adult individual subsequent removal apical meristem leading death plant deforestation high degree degradation forest remnant pressure palm heart exploration contributed risk specie extinction atlantic forest last decade edulis fruit reached highest commercial value producing southeastern equivalent amazonian açai euterpe oleracea pulp palm fruit rich nutritional value anthocyanins phenolic compound demonstrating high antioxidant capacity thus currently used health nutrition perspective shade-tolerant specie edulis adapts well agroforestry system ast activity growing gaining social economic importance southern region brazil ast considered sustainable land-use system address production need providing environmental benefit society agroforestry provides various ecosystem service biodiversity conservation carbon sequestration reduction crop disease increased biological control biological nitrogen fixation nutrient cycling besides income
