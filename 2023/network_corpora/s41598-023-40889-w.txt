recruitment follow-up must considered interpreting result randomized controlled trial design underpowered however study represents first attempt prospectively investigate ffp fracture usual studying frail patient group recruitment difficult therefore information provided paper may likely add scientific information field pelvic surgery although underpowered secondly loss follow-up unusual geriatric cohort nevertheless achieved follow-up rate still representative especially older population thirdly conducted non-blinded follow-up evaluation nature surgery allow blinded follow-up understandably sham surgery would unethical cohort elderly number pre-existing condition also noteworthy strength study prominently first study examine emerging injury prospective manner without surgical selection bias often seen previous publication conclusion result randomized controlled pilot trial indicates surgical treatment ffp fracture geriatric patient may superior conservative treatment non-displaced posterior pelvic ring fracture ffp older population may treated comprehensive conservative therapy analgesia physical therapy full weight bearing crucial note early mobilization possible switch operative treatment occur promptly rather attempting conservative management extended period vigilant follow-up essential prevent prolonged immobilization detect fracture progression methodology used pilot trial may valuable designing larger multi-center trial confirm finding improve clinical decision-making ffp fracture elderly
