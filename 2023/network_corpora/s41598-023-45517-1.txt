introduction date four specie porcine circoviruses pcvs identified including pcv1 pcv2 pcv3 pcv4 pcv1 nonpathogenic pig pcv2 cause various symptom collectively called porcine circovirus-associated disease pcvads porcine circovirus disease pcvds pcv3 found pig multiple clinical sign however pathogenesis still unknown recently novel pcv4 identified china korea clinically healthy infected pig several clinical presentation including respiratory enteric sign skin lesion suggestive porcine dermatitis nephropathy syndrome pdns therefore despite limited information pcv4 virus overlooked furthermore due lesson learned past experience swine virus asia many emerging virus spread among country due consequence globalization international trade travel officially unofficially therefore recent finding pcv4 china korea would raise awareness virus asian swine practitioner investigate novel pathogen area part focus area prevent detect understand disease distribution impact study

industry finding pcv4 neglected since asia major world hub pig production virus may originate spread region vice versa date pcv4 discovered asian continent china korea recently thailand yet others present study result showed sample tested positive pcv4 positive rate 0.4 3/734 2.07 3/145 farm level interestingly extremely low prevalence pcv4 demonstrated thailand compared previous report suggesting low transmission infection rate within pig herd however nearly swine farm tested mainly located high pig density area thailand might reflect whole picture pcv4 infection status country thus future large-scale field sampling region could provide information pcv4 epidemiology thailand therefore threat pcv4 thai swine industry skeptical yet elucidated recently pig inoculated rescued pcv4 alone showed histopathological change several organ obvious clinical sign found present study found three pcv4-positive sample clinically infected pig found coinfected pcv2 3/3 prrsv 2/3 result apparently suggest absence factor coinfections pcv4 infection might remain asymptomatic however synergistic effect pcv4 infection might exacerbate disease severity associated prdc clinically infected pig found present study therefore co-infections unknown factor yet elucidated might involve pcv4 pathogenesis clinical outcome according situ hybridization result virus presence found bronchiolar epithelial cell lymphocyte histiocyte-like cell lymphoid follicle consistently characteristic pcv2 infection whether pcv4 infection bronchiolar epithelial cell tracheobronchial lymph node induces observed broncho-interstitial pneumonia lymphoid depletion studied contribution pcv4 pathogenesis prdc immune modulation interest finding also suggest marked tropism pcv4 bronchial epithelial cell may impair epithelial barrier function thus predisposing infected pig secondary infection prdc case history pcv4 positive case found pcv4-infected pig found coinfected pcv2 prrsv and/or streptococcus spp additionally bronchial epithelial infection might contribute viral shedding dynamic nasal secretion notably reported highest positive rate pcv4 detected nasal swab followed serum sample therefore nasal swab might better target specimen pcv4 detection surveillance investigation needed genetic analysis thai pcv4 strain shared nucleotide identity reference pcv4 strain high genetic stability pcv4 consistent previous report noted thai pcv4 strain closely related chinese pcv4 sub-cluster although virus high genetic stability genetic variation could observed among pig population different country probably specific geographic origin additionally thai pcv4 strain highly related possibly due single point introduction low infection rate restricted gene flow neighboring district western thailand suggesting novel virus might confined area affecting prevalence genetic diversity additionally currently fully established guideline classifying pcv4 genotype temporary proposal made far consistent contrast pcv2 genotyping unified classification scheme based cap gene proposed pcv4 genotyping several study proposing different criterion marker differentiate pcv4 genotype 2-group classification pcv4a pcv4b 3-group classification pcv4a pcv4b pcv4c among study residue capsid gene also proposed used distinguishing pcv4a 212l pcv4b 27n 212m recently pcv4c proposed specific amino acid pattern 27n 28r 212m however genotyping criterion pcv4c might classified pcv4b therefore use differing nomenclature create ambiguity misinterpretation result investigation required establish standardized criterion genotyping pcv4 given current paucity sequence information mentioned previous report showed amino acid position cap gene could used marker distinguish pcv4a pcv4b 27n however result study showed amino acid residue position used differentiate pcv4a pcv4b since thai pcv4b strain korean pcv4b strain ku-02010 ku-02011 showed n27s fig novel finding study suggest amino acid variation position could used differentiating pcv4a 212l pcv4b 212m 2-group classification moreover one unique amino acid substitution i80v also found thai pcv4 strain cap gene amino acid substitution occurred residue 72–88 b-cell epitope pcv4 capsid gene may alter antigenic property virus immunogenic modification caused genetic mutation however effect genetic mutation pathogenicity need investigation term genetic variation pcv4 genotype study conducted various region china found pcv4a common genotype followed pcv4b however pig population korea thailand pcv4b genotype detected plausible consider pcv4
