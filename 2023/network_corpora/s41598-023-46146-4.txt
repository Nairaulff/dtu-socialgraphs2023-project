introduction world 1/3 population chronic hepatitis infection currently infected people hbsag positive .when effective treatment available patient refuse receive patient develop liver fibrosis even compensatory cirrhosis every year progression disease patient cirrhosis gradually develop decompensated cirrhosis .as result severe complication liver cirrhosis portal hypertension spontaneous peritonitis hepatic encephalopathy etc patient repeatedly hospitalized daily life also adversely affected severe patient even die liver cirrhosis .there doubt great challenge china medical cause china incidence rate prevalence hepatitis decreased past year since vaccine policy implemented significantly reduced incidence end-stage liver disease liver cancer caused chronic hepatitis short period time .therefore still need solve public health problem cirrhosis end-stage liver disease even liver cancer caused hepatitis liver biopsy generally considered gold standard diagnosing liver fibrosis/cirrhosis however invasive procedure cause pain repeated certain risk often unacceptable patient .furthermore quality liver biopsy sample generally restricted factor sample size sampling error histological error inconspicuous histological finding early stage fibrosis.therefore liver biopsy routinely used detect liver fibrosis/cirrhosis thus several noninvasive method developed evaluate liver fibrosis/cirrhosis due limitation liver biopsy.in general method divided biological one based identification serological marker physical one based radiographic assessment liver elasticity .as serum marker diagnostic accuracy influenced many factor diagnostic rate early fibrosis low literature showing variability natural evolution hbv immune activity inflammation affect accuracy serum marker diagnosing hbv fibrosis cirrhosis result many patient advanced fibrosis cirrhosis missed .as result limitation serum marker indicate liver fibrosis/cirrhosis used widely hepatitis liver fibrosis/cirrhosis elastic image reflects mechanical property tissue hardness fibrosis level positively correlated hardness .elastography imaging method commonly used vibration controlled transient elastography vcte shear wave elastography swe point shear wave elastography pswe magnetic resonance elastography mre .american association gastroenterology acg european association liver research easl european federation medical biological ultrasound society euroson recently recommended vcte evaluation chronic liver disease cld fibrosis associated chronic viral hepatitis .according euroson vcte also known fibroscan echosens greater 7.6 kpa indicates significant fibrosis 11.0–13.6 kpa indicates cirrhosis .the literature suggests although vcte replace liver biopsy used substitute patient refuse liver biopsy method evaluating cld long period time time people believed liver fibrosis irreversible especially disease progressed stage cirrhosis.in recent year numerous study demonstrated liver fibrosis reversible pathophysiological condition .currently antiviral treatment main treatment hepatitis liver fibrosis.the treatment slightly reverse liver fibrosis limited drug resistance poor virological response patients.despite long-term antiviral treatment patient may develop liver fibrosis .there extensive research showing traditional chinese medicine effectively treat liver fibrosis improve liver function recent year .biejia decoction pill traditional chinese medicine compound significantly improved liver fibrosis vivo vitro.a biejia decoction pill used inhibit proliferation decrease collagen content activated hsc-lx-2 cell inhibiting collagen deposition cell reported researchers.the researcher also found biejia decoction pill down-regulated tgf-β smad3 expression changed percentage g0/g1 phase cell suggesting biejia decoction pill may work preventing liver injury reversing liver fibrosis primary mechanism .additionally relevant pharmacological study demonstrated biejia decoction pill stimulate degradation collagen tissue well dissolve absorb liver fibrosis reduce collagen synthesis decrease excessive deposition effectively reverse liver fibrosis paper attempt evaluate identify change liver elasticity value patient liver fibrosis cirrhosis caused chronic hepatitis treatment using vcte liver fibrosis scanning quantitatively evaluate efficacy etv biejia decoction pill treating liver fibrosis cirrhosis hepatitis patients.so provide clinical data treatment plan clinical management chronic hepatitis patient

discussion lack effective safe therapeutic option chronic hepatitis make difficult clear latent virus-like particle body clinician mainly use antiviral therapy control disease progression.even patient hepatitis virus replication active would cause serious acute liver problems.but possibility hepatitis eventually turn liver fibrosis worsens liver function eventually lead cirrhosis end-stage liver disease hepatocellular carcinoma according longitudinal analysis untreated hepatitis patient cumulative risk developing cirrhosis within five year contrast patient cirrhosis caused cause patient cause significantly lower survival rate prognosis five-year survival rate .there still patient hepatitis whose disease process effectively controlled even receiving active antiviral treatment time causing develop cirrhosis even end-stage liver disease may caused chronic hepatitis low-level viremia llv treatment cycle llv refers persistent intermittent hbv dna load greater lower limit detection exceeding iu/ml.an analysis risk factor fibrosis progression patient persistently low level hepatitis virus load treatment show hypoviremia affect stage hepatitis patient higher risk liver fibrosis maintained virological response mvr .according study percent rate liver fibrosis progression antiviral treatment percent rate uncertain liver fibrosis progression percent rate liver fibrosis regression among patient obvious liver fibrosis.cox univariate multivariate analysis risk factor progression liver fibrosis showed risk aggravation liver fibrosis llv patient increased nearly five time course treatment week reported even active antiviral treatment 1/5–3/5 patient still suffer disease progression two year severe case even liver failure.after antiviral treatment one third patient developed llv may explain poor prognosis.according study patient without viral response likely stimulated various cytokine produce series immune response liver fibrosis one major factor contributing liver cancer progression.accordingly llv patient likely mrv patient develop liver cancer study small number patient subgroup experienced fibrosis aggravation treatment stage aggravation degree observation group much lower control group might related enhancement anti-virus effect entecavir biejia decoction pills.after treatment biejia decoction pill prolongation course treatment course treatment month rate hbv-dna turning negative observation group reached 87.4 number significantly higher control group 70.8 difference statistically significant 0.002 0.05 .the rate hbv-dna turning negative observation group reach treatment period months.even patient liver cirrhosis experienced cirrhosis reversal one year combined treatment lsm 17.5 several study shown liver fibrosis continues progress patient mrv specific mechanism remains unclear.this may related metabolic syndrome alcohol consumption factors.there still improvement liver fibrosis patient mrv observation group study suggesting biejia decoction pill could reverse liver fibrosis strengthening antiviral treatment entecavir.using biejia decoction pill modern pharmacological research show clear liver reduces liver fibrosis inhibits collagen production decrease serum transaminase level inhibits release inflammatory factor reduces liver fibrosis reducing liver inflammatory activity based domestic study observing effect biejia decoction pill improvement liver inflammation fibrosis mouse model liver fibrosis found biejia obvious inhibitory effect mononuclear macrophage mouse experiment theoretically proved biejia anti-inflammatory anti-fibrotic.based result mechanism action may related inhibition monocyte infiltration reduction monocyte pro-inflammatory pro-fibrotic cytokine secretion .the study confirmed possibility treating liver fibrosis monocyte target well provided new idea clarify liver fibrosis molecular level future subgroup analysis patient liver fibrosis group showed significant difference reversing liver fibrosis observation group control group mild fibrosis subgroup 0.441 0.506 0.05 three 6.5 patient observation group experienced fibrosis aggravation compared 18.2 patient control group.the reversal rate observation group significantly higher control group moderate severe fibrosis subgroup difference statistically significant 4.82 0.028 0.05 .therefore patient early mild liver fibrosis mrv entecavir given long-term antiviral treatment monitor lsm regularly.the risk liver fibrosis progression high patient llv adjust antiviral drug patient poor response virology use compound biejia decoction pill long-term treatment recommended toachieve viral response reverse liver fibrosis soon possible nearly patient mild liver fibrosis slight aggravation.in patient essential undergo regular vcte examination monitor progression liver fibrosis well monitor hbv-dna level order understand virus replication status.according study patient moderate severe fibrosis cirrhosis developed fibrosis aggravation antiviral treatment highlighting poor antiviral fibrosis reversal efficacy entecavir.therefore matter whether patient mrv add compound biejia decoction pill time control progress liver fibrosis adjust course treatment according result hbv-dna vcte test delay progression liver fibrosis greatest extent possible sum patient chronic hepatitis basis entecavir capsule treatment supplemented biejia decoction pill treatment help control development liver fibrosis patient may even reverse liver fibrosis improve clinical symptoms.in addition patient higher response rate hbv dna virus use time biejia decoction pill prolonged contributed efficacy entecavir antiviral treatment.in recent year domestic study shown traditional chinese medicine reverse chronic liver fibrosis caused variety factor addition cheap safe easy access drug provide hope controlling liver fibrosis cirrhosis future next conduct systematic study pathology molecular level traditional chinese medicine proven definite effect liver fibrosis clarify cellular molecular mechanism fibrosis regression investigate possible pathogenesis liver fibrosis order develop new drug conclusion hepatitis liver fibrosis/cirrhosis patient treated biejia decoction pill etv showed significant improvement liver fibrosis virological response rate hbv-dna increased prolonged treatment suggesting biejia decoction pillsmay help entecavir antiviral activity
