mild head trauma intracerebral lesion 0.4 required surgery simulator study head hit top hood front hood strike left foot pedestrian pedestrian spin air fall ground making first contact ground head second right shoulder short head pedestrian hit several time collision therefore simple early symptom like headache expected present study lower limb pelvic injury followed upper extremity chest injury three prevalent injury occurred head injury simultaneously another study traditional triad pedestrian injury i.e head pelvis knee introduced researcher reported head injury high number mild concussion common injury site pedestrian however putting head injury aside common serious injury lower limb recent study injury reported leg followed head neck damage upper extremity respectively different result related diverse range factor including different method heterogeneity defining variable used hospital registration system development automotive industry country reported large hood used producing new vehicle cause damage pelvic bone event pedestrian-vehicle accident adding using wide flat bumper new vehicle reduce lower limb fracture depending type vehicle consequence injury pedestrian different developed developing country meanwhile new car safe hood produced country car industry severity pedestrian lower injury reduced present study type vehicle accurately recorded correlation weight mortality morbidity could explored moreover child different pattern injury adult study child ten year also included therefore inclusion criterion entering current study different study term age obviously led different finding mortality rate present study 4.91 similar study higher rate pedestrian mortality reported i.e 23.2 south africa furthermore according hospital report head injury leading cause death among pedestrian however detail type brain injury reported another study second common cause death pedestrian hemorrhage/shock 64.7 head injury 26.7 apart report good vital sign pedestrian another reason low mortality present study attributed fact majority pmvas occurred street urban area rasht city thus injury severity mortality rate lower pmvas occurring roadside highway vehicle drive faster present study pedestrian suffered penetrating trauma transmitted hospital although significant number patient transferred present scene nonetheless one study time reach scene rate transfer predict hospital mortality good predictor common therapeutic measure present study outpatient treatment airway endotracheal intubation resuscitation respectively epidemiological study traumatic brain injury iran control bleeding lost volume greater operation rate two treatment airway control endotracheal intubation resuscitation equal however treatment measure airway management control bleeding loss volume play important role reducing mortality traumatic injury personnel information knowledge deal emergency condition provided private transfer present study three common surgery performed pedestrian head injury scalp laceration repair surgery lower limb surgery upper limb surgery respectively similar study however pedestrian surgery related lower extremity majority injury subject scalp laceration therefore surgery laceration repair consider simple repair surgery finding would exactly bogert study lower limb surgery present study mortality rate severe disability rate significantly higher men woman similar study death likelihood 2.3 time higher men woman result study provide strong indication existing relationship individual social context pedestrian involvement mvas including gender pedestrian also found male pedestrian exposed pmva higher rate mortality morbidity men stem higher overall mortality men woman presence traffic majority patient study discharged hospital good general condition moderate disability also noticeable higher men woman similar study pelvic lower limb fracture common cause disability one year mvas common type concurrent injury reported injured patient head injury due pmvas important cause high death rate recent year many collision leading brain damage predictable preventable report shown country taken precautionary measure implemented safety strategy successful reducing mvas since lot cost imposed government different level society adopting appropriate preventive measure great importance conclusion significant number pmvas shown dominant pattern head injury male pedestrian resident urban street rasht city addition increasing rate mortality severe disability especially men make prevention necessity significant number pedestrian injured pmvas brought hospital private car without specialized care highlight need reconsider transfer mode injured patient scene accident medical center
