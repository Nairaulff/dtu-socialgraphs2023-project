introduction hepatitis virus hcv infection common etiologic factor chronic hepatitis liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma hcc world health organization global hepatitis report estimate million individual currently infected hcv worldwide estimate put number infected high 118.9 million however reliable data hcv prevalence difficult obtain surveillance study representative population rare usually include individual high risk factor homelessness incarceration united state estimated overall prevalence anti-hcv adult population 1.7 indicating past current infection approximately 2.4 million american carry virus number based national health nutrition examination survey nhanes data high-risk underrepresented group similar hcv prevalence reported western europe poland majority infected subject 55–80 develop chronic infection whereas minority clear virus almost exclusively early phase infection effectiveness host immune response particularly specific cd4 cd8 t-cells production effector cytokine determine outcome hcv infection however hcv infection continues gradual impairment host immune function referred immune exhaustion spontaneous clearance virus becomes unlikely furthermore likely rapid escape mutation may outpace immune system thus facilitate viral persistence scenario supported observation resolving acute hepatitis typically characterized relative evolutionary stasis chronic infection associated genetic evolution first month infection critical role effective immune response also validated observation transplant recipient receiving immunosuppressive drug almost uniformly develop chronic infection exposed hcv spontaneous clearance virus setting extremely rare event study natural course infection acute preclinical phase resolution chronicity extremely limited mainly owing difficulty obtaining sample patient early phase primary infection thus largely confined chimpanzee study iatrogenic exposure transfusion needlestick accident among health care worker however latter study may representative general population common form hcv infection iatrogenic community-acquired furthermore since subject community-acquired infection found hcv rna positive may better prognosis overall iatrogenic infection chronicity rate close unique opportunity study large group subject identified early preclinical seronegative phase hcv infection

program following iatrogenic occupational exposure asymptomatic infection constitute vast majority novo hcv infection elude detection detected accidentally thus common form hcv infection

provided serum sample determination hcv status current study largest analysis community-acquired sporadic hcv infection identified pre-seroconversion phase far one largest regard number acute hepatitis case analyzed study followed donor found hcv rna negative thus considered cleared infection spontaneously systematic review acute hepatitis study micallef reported patient cleared infection patient clinical hepatitis significantly higher proportion viral clearance post-transfusion sero-incident study similar result reported gerlach large study case acute hepatitis spontaneous clearance observed acute symptomatic case asymptomatic patient developed chronic infection however latter group small encompassed patient explanation phenomenon proposed symptomatic disease surrogate marker strength immune response reason discrepancy clearance rate asymptomatic infection report current study unclear data line recent population-wide study slightly half anti-hcv positive patient found hcv rna positive perhaps somewhat higher clearance rate community-acquired infection could related lower inoculation viral load resulting pronounced bottleneck effect compared transfusion-related iatrogenic exposure donor initially denied risky behavior identified infected questioned face face interview admitted unprotected sex new partner within last month four also injected drug within time donor likely called 'test seeker blood donation often cheapest simplest way get tested hiv transmissible disease socially acceptable non-stigmatizing setting thus study suggests significant role sexual transmission community acquired hcv infection likely horizontal transmission hcv spouse spouse reported number study however latter evidence mostly circumstantial increased risk transmission hcv-positive patient household member also includes sibling parent offspring suggests long close contact represent risk case new hcv infection identified currently western europe usa associated history injecting drug use iatrogenic exposure health-care facility large proportion case clear risk factor identified evidence chimpanzee iatrogenic exposure study early event determine eventual outcome infection—clearance chronicity finding suggest also true community-acquired infection subject cleared infection significantly higher level il-1 il-6 fgf2 ifn-gamma viral infection cleared two ways—by destruction infected cell via natural killer cell inane immune system cytotoxic cell ctl adaptive immune system noncytolytic process mediated antiviral cytokine subject cleared infection somewhat lower alt activity higher cytokine level including ifn-gamma suggests latter dominant factor well established virus-specific cd8+ cell required control hcv infection effector function includes cytolytic non-cytolytic mechanism latter ifn-gamma mediated seems dominant vitro model responsible viral inhibition low effector-to-target ratio cytotoxicity observed ifn-gamma production seems also important component early cell response hcv exposure production increased acute decreased chronic hepatitis probably facilitating inability eradicate virus directly antiviral il-1 il-1 alpha il-1 beta il-1ra il-6 considered important cytokine produced response infection macrophage cell dendritic cell also multiple cell type il-6 pleiotropic activating jak/stat3 pathway promoting transcription gene involved cellular signaling gene regulation pro- anti-inflammatory effect patient clearing infection also higher level fibroblast growth factor fgf2 growing evidence suggests fibroblast growth factor/fgf receptor fgf/fgfr signaling play significant role regulating cellular lineage commitment differentiation proliferation apoptosis various type cell fgf2 pro-inflammatory increased serum level previously described patient chronic hcv infection particularly high viral load several study reported presence cellular reactivity absence anti-hcv suggesting existence form transient likely localized infection however among subject one seroconverted suggests detectable level replication seroconversion almost universal data line large prospective analysis hcv infection idu hcv rna could detected subset cohort never seroconverted similarly hcv-specific antibody induced absence viremia prospective analysis health care worker accidentally exposed low amount hcv despite persistently hcv rna negative subject latter study showed evidence specific nkt/nk cell chemokines t-cells response find correlation infection outcome hcv e2/hvr1 quasispecies divergence complexity however dynamic studied single time-point serum sample available several study change e2/hvr1 quasispecies acute phase infection likely caused mounting immune pressure predictive ensuing chronic infection whereas stability associated resolution patient carrying il28b homozygote major allele rs12979860 genotype reported enhanced spontaneous hcv clearance rate genotype rare among patient present four patient two cleared infection similarly study reported higher initial viremia associated spontaneous clearance observe difference serum viral load patient cleared infection remained hcv
