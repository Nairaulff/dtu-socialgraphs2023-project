introduction goat milk production rise globally considered healthier alternative cow milk due unique chemical composition global goat milk production estimated 20.4 million metric ton asia africa prominent producer middle east north africa mena region also significant producer goat milk egypt one leading country region egypt goat milk production increasing steadily estimated 215,000 metric ton produced small-scale farmer produce goat milk egypt mainly consumed locally export neighboring country goat milk differs cow milk chemical composition higher level essential nutrient like calcium phosphorus vitamin b12 also higher proportion medium-chain fatty acid easily digested body long-chain fatty acid found cow milk additionally goat milk lower level lactose different protein structure cow milk lower casein concentration cow milk almost αs1-casein making tolerable people lactose intolerance cow milk protein allergy due unique composition goat milk several health benefit including improved digestion bone health robust immune system also used produce various dairy product cheese yogurt ice cream adding versatility market demand recently interest using essential oil feed additive lactating animal due potential health productivity benefit essential oil natural compound extracted various plant shown posse antimicrobial antioxidant immunomodulatory property among essential oil studied potential feed additive lactating animal coriander oil derived coriandrum sativum plant apiaceae family coriander oil contains several bioactive compound including linalool α-pinene terpinene several study demonstrated coriander oil antimicrobial antioxidant property indicating potential natural alternative various infectious disease oxidative stress-related condition additionally coriander oil found posse anti-inflammatory effect suppressing inflammatory mediator reducing inflammatory marker potential therapeutic use metabolic gastrointestinal disorder suggested positive
