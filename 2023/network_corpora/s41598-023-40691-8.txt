introduction dispersal pervading feature animal important role shaping ecological evolutionary pattern natural population dispersal movement individual across space entailing potential consequence gene flow influenced many factor among intra- inter-specific competition e.g. food habitat mating partner predation habitat loss lack resource environmental stochasticity e.g. flood storm event seem prevailing mechanism driving dispersal however dispersal also depends individual performance organism alteration individual performance including directly indirectly induced parasite may influence ability proneness organism disperse parasite modulate animal behavior indirectly pathogenicity defense response induction directly via host manipulation parasite-induced change might instance affect mobility habitat selection foraging reproduction longevity host morphology hence trade-off cost benefit dispersal might influenced parasite instance seabird might disperse escape infested habitat meanwhile condition-dependent dispersal large terrestrial herbivore reduces dispersal propensity host higher parasite load parasite might also manipulate host disperse frequently increasing chance contact next host thereby enhancing transmission rate aquatic ecosystem example uninfected amphipod prefer dark shaded area contrast conspecific infected acanthocephalan cystacanths show reverse geotaxis reverse phototaxis likely found open water behavioral change intermediate host may enhance individual vulnerability predation thus lead higher transmission rate however host manipulation might also work opposite direction e.g. limiting drift mermithid-infected mayfly nymph avoid predation fish would result death host parasite nevertheless parasite-induced alteration host phenotype

conspecific heterospecific individual might occur bolstering parasite infection size-asymmetric cannibalism common many taxon including fish aquatic invertebrate mainly size-structured specie overlapping generation time space cannibalism commonly observed pulex might potentially favor transmission parasite via ingestion infected individual turn microsporidian parasite might influence conspecific heterospecific predatory interaction enhanced aggression host size likewise explained difference microsporidian prevalence drifting stationary pulex larger individual common drift compared stationary sample suggests either large specimen dispersive higher prevalence larger specimen drive dispersal generally larger body size implies higher energy cost food intake also lower locomotion cost per unit body mass favoring movement richer patch enhancing dispersal accordingly microcosm experiment home range insensibilis greater larger individual could fully exploit patch hand smaller individual lower energetic requirement tended use limited set patch nevertheless resource field might limited experimental setup individual habitat preference coupled inter intraspecific interaction might influence home range although clear pattern pulex size water flow detected present study smaller individual likely prefer low water velocity near bank microhabitats leaf accumulate providing

spore contained egg horizontally transmitted parasite generally linked high virulence might reduce host fitness instance enterocytozoon hepatopenaei microsporidian belonging enterocytozoonida clade infects hepatopancreas various shrimp inducing storage consumption lipid downregulation lipid metabolism thus energy production therefore plausible reduction fitness might occur hinder ability pulex withstand water flow thus likely found drift enhanced drift infected individual likely benefit horizontally transmitted parasite favoring spore dispersal although drift might result spore dilution limit cannibalism many spore persist environment even absence suitable host depending microsporidian specie spore resistant thus evolutionary perspective might suggest horizontally-transmitted parasite might produce environmentally-resistant spore vertically-transmitted parasite case long-lasting spore transported downstream might accumulate time area low water flow reaching density suitable successful infection amphipod likely use area feeding ground leaf organic matter tend accumulate infection may occur spore inadvertently ingested feeding activity vertically-transmitted parasite virulent horizontally-transmitted one either positive neutral effect host fitness rely successful host reproduction transmission hence host drifting might counterproductive several reason first drift expose host predation possibly ending parasite life cycle second drift might reduce host chance encountering suitable partner due possible dilution effect amphipod often aggregated patchy
