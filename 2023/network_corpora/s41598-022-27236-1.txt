introduction understanding various landscape characteristic including ecological environmental social attribute influence ecosystem service essentially important assessment planning management sustainable enjoyment especially identification relationship ecological structure e.g specie community vegetation characteristic ecosystem service crucial ass impact ecosystem change service without knowledge human impact ecological structure e.g extinction specie vegetation shift due climate change fully reflected assessment ecosystem service example empirical knowledge wild bee dependence type land-use available nesting site enabled build estimation model crop pollination service model implemented invest used numerous study assessing impact land-use change service however cultural ecosystem service assessment forecast performed without basis knowledge ecological structure contribute service common strategy spatial assessment proxy-based method assigns single value service land cover class based evidence collected often elsewhere outside study area although low reliability method doe reflect ecological heterogeneity within land cover class criticized method still popular possibly collection primary data development model explicitly associate service ecological structure difficult recently empirical model developed understand association ecological structure study revealed vary ecological structure least case example ridding demonstrated proportion forest positively associate people preference place outdoor recreation however model often relatively simple and/or assume consistent effect ecological structure throughout study area possibly modeling often requires relatively large number explanatory variable encompassing ecological environmental social factor therefore making model complex easy however plenty evidence association ecological structure whose demand depends sociocultural background beneficiary complex context-dependent example termansen analyzed forest

different tourist resident context-dependence important association ecological structure spatial assessment service based average effect portrayed simple model e.g unit increase natural vegetation uniformly promote service flow throughout study area irrespective context essentially misleading one main purpose spatial assessment ecosystem service quantify spatial heterogeneity effect artificial
