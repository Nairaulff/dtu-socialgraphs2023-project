revealed prevalence anemia among pregnant 45.2 non-pregnant 39.5 woman lmics higher compared global prevalence among pregnant woman among non-pregnant woman based target world health organization prevalence anemia among reproductive-aged woman decrease 15.2 finding found prevalence anemia among reproductive-aged woman lmics pregnant non-pregnant woman remains high far global target comparable previous study among lmics mali consistently higher anemia prevalence pregnant non-pregnant woman lowest among pregnant woman armenia non-pregnant woman rwanda previous study suggested mali vaginal parasitic infection sociocultural imposed food restriction contributed increased rate anemia among pregnant woman therefore prevention control vaginal parasitic infection health information regarding nutritional food pregnancy might help mitigating anemia mali neighboring country similar public health challenge found pregnant non-pregnant woman lmic pooled anemia prevalence higher among pregnant among non-pregnant woman similar study china karachi pakistan higher rate anemia pregnant woman due fact pregnancy iron requirement higher due greater plasma volume expansion support pregnancy leading decreased hemoglobin level increase risk pregnant woman developing anemia emphasizes importance antenatal iron supplementation preventing anemia decreasing risk pregnant woman anemia recommends daily oral intake supplement containing iron 30–60 folic acid 0.4 throughout pregnancy among woman prevention anemia well prevention puerperal infection low birth weight premature birth study found education wealth status pregnant non-pregnant woman associated anemia woman educated secondary level education likely anemia compared woman higher education similarly woman poorest richer wealth class likely anemia compared richest group woman finding comparable previous study lmics including nepal ethiopia india nigeria pakistan linking socioeconomic factor anemia education strong relationship income wealth individual better education tend earn income finishing least college degree equates better salary addition woman better education probably better knowledge health behavior turn encourages adopt healthier lifestyle eating nutritious food better health decision-making better hygienic habit hand woman higher wealth status may better financial capacity access material good service include healthcare service situation potentially result better access nutritious food better healthcare service contribute prevention control anemia woman higher education richest wealth status compared woman lower education wealth status therefore anemia control program free food supplement nutrition counseling among woman lower education marginalized poor woman lmics potentially help reducing anemia prevalence found study family size five member increased likelihood lmic pregnant non-pregnant woman anemia compared woman family member finding similar study ethiopia pakistan wherein woman five family member two-fold increased risk anemia may result food poverty reduced nutrient consumption could averted anemia due bigger family noted household size increase food insecurity rate increase availability affordable nutritious food containing iron woman large family size might strategy mitigate anemia food-insecure community woman lmics exposed mass medium likely

presentation combined powerpoint presentation anemia pregnancy non-anemic control group woman received standard antenatal care including iron supplement non-anemic study indicate vital role mass medium promotion health prevention disease suggested exposing woman health information via health education program effective educating various information regarding proper diet may help become familiar food classification improve ability choose food increase hemoglobin level high iron protein vitamin similar quasi-experimental study conducted indonesia revealed pregnant woman benefited receiving health education counseling visual handbook increased hemoglobin hematocrit level currently mass medium channel information brochure poster press article advertisement television radio communication social medium e.g twitter facebook whatsapp promoted spread awareness public health issue exposing people various medium channel provide information promotion health prevention disease may crucial technique lower anemia prevalence among reproductive-aged woman lmics found rural woman also likely anemia compared urban woman lmics similar result reported previous study lmics including pakistan ethiopia nigeria anemia may common rural location due high rate poverty inadequate access healthy food safe water education basic medical service situation also explain increased likelihood non-pregnant woman unimproved source drinking water anemia poor drinking water source common problem rural poor community resulted several public health issue anemia previous investigation observed unavailability poor source water supply found associated anemia among reproductive-aged woman developing country exposure poor-quality water supply cause spread parasitic infection malaria schistosomiasis linked prevalence anemia commonly known schistosomiasis parasitic infection cause persistent blood loss result anemia study chile also found drinking water contaminated arsenic increased risk anemia woman arsenic chemical found groundwater system higher concentration especially shallow tube well groundwater source well commonly used household water supply lmics therefore deworming area parasitic infection common iron supplementation intervention safe water source sanitation system play crucial part minimizing anemia nutritional loss brought water-borne infection study found pregnant woman aged 25–34 35–49 year decreased risk anemia respectively compared 15–24-year age bracket comparable study conducted nepal reduced risk anemia among pregnant woman aged year might due better health decision-making taking good care pregnancy compared younger pregnant woman instance several study lmics shown 25-year-old woman compliant taking prescribed antenatal iron supplement woman year age iron supplementation part antenatal care package treatment prevention anemia pregnancy lmic non-pregnant woman using contraceptive likely anemia compared woman using result similar previous study contraceptive use lowered risk woman anemia nepal found woman using hormonal injectable contraceptive depo-provera higher level hemoglobin concentration strong negative relationship hormonal contraceptive use anemia discovered supporting finding study pointing potential preventive effect hormonal contraception anemia reduced menstrual flow result hormonal contraceptive use likely primary mechanism promoting use modern hormonal contraceptive method among sexually active woman potential decrease prevalence anemia among non-pregnant woman lmics health insurance combine risk asset group people protect person financial burden paying medical bill brought sickness accident disability could effective substitute out-of-pocket expense associated financial cost study non-pregnant woman covered health insurance likely anemia inversely suggests woman health insurance decreased risk anemia limited literature investigating connection health insurance anemia among woman nonetheless longitudinal household survey burkina faso west africa found household community health insurance membership 2.23 time likely utilize healthcare service compared without possible health-insured woman lmics used every healthcare service related promotion nutrition iron supplementation treatment prevention anemia reduced risk anemia therefore inclusion reproductive-aged woman health insurance coverage potentially reduces anemia prevalence lmics non-pregnant woman pregnancy termination history also known abortion found likely anemia woman similarly study trinidad tobago island country caribbean found woman 2–3 terminated pregnancy likely anemia abortion increased likelihood woman history abortion anemia may linked hemorrhage one complication abortion resulting increased risk anemia post-abortion hemorrhage might result blood loss due cervical vaginal laceration uterine atony brought termination pregnancy address complication pregnancy termination hemorrhage assessment woman hemodynamic status anticipation possible blood transfusion recommended study multipara grand multipara woman 1.07 time likely anemia nullipara woman childbirth history finding comparable investigation developing country several study also show similar result relationship high parity prevalence anemia brazil woman two child twofold risk tof anemia compared woman child nepal woman child likely anemia prevalence anemia fact increased contrary study china found woman one child decreased risk anemia rural area western china family planning policy china time allowing one child based sub-population feature socioeconomic situation may one explanation contradicting conclusion indicates woman higher socioeconomic class choose one child may lower risk anemia woman low socioeconomic condition woman household poor socioeconomic status planning number child family sustain support may way reduce risk woman anemia shown indian regression decomposition study decline proportion child age five responsible hemoglobin concentration increase pregnant woman fact study used combined data nationally representative dhs survey lmics one main advantage high sample size therefore sufficient ability
