introduction cotton crop called white gold world cultivated million hectare worldwide cotton second important economic crop pakistan make 0.80 pakistan gdp pakistan world third largest consumer cotton fourth largest cotton grower seventh largest apparel producer last two decade crop covered 185.1 million hectare land popular use protein engineering technology transgenic agriculture including cotton efficiently control lepidopterous insect however cotton yield affected various density-dependent independent factor insect pest particularly pectinophora gossypiella saunders notorious pest cotton crop causing 20–30 yield reduction cotton type fh-142 mnh-886 ir-3701 fh-lalazar shown resistance pink bollworm contrast non-bt refuge caused resistance bollworm cotton e.g. gossypiella monophagous caterpillar gossypiella become resistant toxin eat cotton early stage early life stage continued planting cotton creates selection pressure resistant caterpillar increasing number cotton acre increase ability resist toxin resulting population resistant larva gossypiella oligophagous mostly monophagous initial stage vulnerable detrimental effect e.g. second instar bollworm insecticide bioassay first instar used due small size susceptibility case gossypiella 1st instar enters inside cotton boll tip within 30–45 min hatching gossypiella economically harmful pest feed reproductive part cotton crop inconspicuous manner nearly 4.5 million bale cotton yield lost pakistan due attack furthermore oligophagous mostly monophagous nature feeding cotton fruiting part gossypiella developed resistance bt-toxin practice growing non cotton refugia prevailing pakistan main reason resistance development monophagous oligophagous insect develop resistance easily gene diluted susceptible population compared feed alternative host study basic information insect pest necessary integrated pest management ipm however biology rearing gossypiella reported cotton boll okra artificial diet including cotton seed chickpea flour non-bt cotton boll wheat germ via traditional life table tool study basic information artificial diet convenient meanwhile challenging employ natural diet e.g. cotton boll
