recognizable unrecognizable fish product labeled anchovy hake tuna commercialized european company analysis consisted extracting dna fish product authenticated followed amplification sequencing suite dna marker comparing resulting sequence genbank sequence database using blast basic tool alignment search tool http carefully reanalyzing data identify error identification tuna specie conclude best blast hit alone used evidence fraud seafood product traceability essential detect intentional unintentional mislabeling thus help reduce unreported unregulated illegal fishing enhancing consumer safety genetic method shown powerful seafood product traceability particular morphological characteristic confidently used young age specimen e.g. juvenile bigeye yellowfin tuna difficult distinguish closely related specie e.g black white anglerfish especially processed product e.g filleted canned anatomical trait important fish identification e.g head fin skin absent accurate genetic based seafood product traceability requires developing approach unequivocally discriminate specie essential understand intra-specific variability well specie evolutionary context study blanco-fernandez use

therefore claim existing fraud highly appreciated fish still hold yet clear easy detect case tuna could tip iceberg error made food fraud study relying solely best blast hit report mislabeling indeed bluefin tuna albacore case isolated one instance genetic introgression could lead misidentification increasingly reported teleost fish e.g additionally factor traditionally used morphological character specie assignment diagnostic also occur lead false conclusion regarding mislabelling case black white anglerfish mislabelling reported based colour peritoneum specie diagnostic character whereas recently discovered black anglerfish white peritoneum thus reported mislabelling likely shown questioning understanding evolutionary history specie investigation essential seafood fraud study could avoid error one made blanco-fernandez report mislabeling albacore product additionally blast result deeply depend accuracy reference database presence contaminated sequence reported genbank blanco-fernandez al. work increase contamination genbank contributed sequence whose taxonomic assignment relied best blast hit consequence three sequence alalunga genbank labelled thynnus sequence well obtained morphologically identifiable specimen retracted genbank avoid ramification summary conclude best blast hit used evidence fraud study seafood authentication consider evolutionary context specie study result serious consequence illustrated problem found work blanco-fernandez al. base claim tuna mislabeling trend spain erroneous taxonomic assignment finally besides using phylogenetic inference instead blast search genetic-based seafood authentication propose generation custom tailored curated reference sequence library specific case study made publicly available recommend checking reference library using phylogenetic quality control detect misidentified dubious sequence testing adequate coverage important specie addition advise review existing literature reporting known case interspecific hybridization haplotype sharing involving included closely related specie finally order avoid inclusion spurious sequence public database recommend submission sequence data produced identified specie upload environmental sample otherwise
