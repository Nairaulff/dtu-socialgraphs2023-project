introduction year covid-19 pandemic reinfections still debated topic reinfection sars-cov-2 mean person infected recovered became infected least day last infection individual develop protection reinfection recovering covid-19 however evidence regarding duration level protection still emerging reinfections described although severe lethal primary infection frequency reinfections occur quickly occur previous infection severity relation initial infection relevant information understand phenomenon impact reinfections reinfection case rare first year pandemic however study coordinated center disease control prevention cdc found increase reinfection case omicron period represented reinfections immunity acquired due infection one variant virus may effective new variant immunity acquired vaccination may offer varying protection different sars-cov-2 variant objective study estimate rate reinfections sars-cov-2 healthcare worker year covid-19 pandemic result march march 37,729 medical

transmission patient-to-hw transmission community transmission predominance omicron variant city sao paulo reinfection represented symptomatic covid-19 case similar previously described moreover higher reinfection rate described varying 3.2 11.6 including asymptomatic case however omicron period proportion increased five time omicron variant spread faster gamma delta variant evidenced progressively shorter duration transition period nevertheless gamma delta period reinfection rare suggesting previous infection vaccination impact effect seems important omicron variant sars-cov-2 reinfections natural immunity last year decline progressively addition described protection reinfection varies across different sars-cov-2 variant data available regarding omicron variant furthermore considering long interval infection possible immunity acquired infection vaccination waned time previously shown data reinforced median interval infection approximately month similar previous study important finding reinfections non-severe however belong high-risk group mostly younger another finding case reinfection first infection occurred pre-voc period previously described study limitation
