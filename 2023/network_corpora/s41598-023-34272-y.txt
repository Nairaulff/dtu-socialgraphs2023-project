introduction dengue public health problem affecting several municipality brazil transmitting agent female aedes aegypti mosquito transmission occurs bite passing virus host individual may develop disease dengue affect thousand people year several country including brazil region latin america according data brazilian ministry health country recorded 1.5 million case dengue death related disease addition region latin america caribbean considered affected dengue total 2.2 million case reported epidemiological situation dengue brazil latin america complex challenging disease endemic many area transmission influenced factor climate change urbanization population migration dengue control requires multifaceted approach involves prevention measure early detection adequate treatment case thus understanding climate variation affect transmission paramount importance understanding vector four serotypes lead severe dengue first infection frequently second third infection proven statistical difference whether second third infection proportion case subclinical infection exposed infective bite aedes aegypti mosquito clinically present disease although immune serotype infected occurs 20–50 infected people second infection dengue serotype predominantly severe first regardless serotypes sequence however serotypes denv2 denv3 considered virulent four serotypes dengue virus denv1 denv2 denv3 denv4 make vaccine development particularly challenging despite ongoing effort develop vaccine vaccine developed yet effective four serotypes dengue due complex nature virus mutate rapidly create new strain making difficult target single vaccine furthermore concern vaccine-induced enhancement disease complicated development safe effective vaccine result prevention strategy mosquito control personal protective measure remain primary method reducing incidence dengue fever transmitted human specie mosquito genus aedes aedes aegypti main vector presence aedes aegypti urban center directly related climatic condition public sanitation climatic variable playing significant role distribution mosquito currently several phenomenon caused global variation climatic condition one

health recent year dengue virus denv arbovirus transmitted bite female aedes aegypti mosquito four different serotypes denv-1 denv-2 denv-3 denv-4 dengue fever affect people age adult young people
