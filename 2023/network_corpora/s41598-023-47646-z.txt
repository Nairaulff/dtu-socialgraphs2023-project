introduction medical diagnosis complex process disease specific gold standard test always available used every patient patient often several disease especially emergency setting medical decision often need made limited information therefore diagnostic process requires several step initial clinical evaluation elaborate expensive test e.g. magnetic resonance imaging diagnostic test binary answer yes/no characterized sensitivity ability detect given condition present specificity ability correctly identify absence given condition point-of-care diagnostic test developed improve first diagnostic orientation sensitivity specificity diagnostic test inflammation key component many disease process either acute phase bacterial viral parasitic infection acute thromboinflammatory disease chronic development cancer diabetes… therefore measuring inflammation level point care great interest initial diagnostic orientation c-reactive protein crp measured point care help determine instance
