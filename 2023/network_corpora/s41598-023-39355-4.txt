surgery found trabecular structure class iii patient mandibular condyle complex typical class patient additionally discussed lower value related lower bone strength information underscore importance cautious applying load tmj region post-orthognathic surgery given potential change trabecular structure implication bone strength limitation one image plane—sagittal axial coronal—was used work examine mandibular condyle microstructure even though method made possible evaluate trabecular structure various plane future research also consider evaluation structure trabecula block image rather using one image plane may help better understand impact severe class iii malocclusion bone quality provide detailed portrayal internal microstructure mandibular condyle finally study examined internal
