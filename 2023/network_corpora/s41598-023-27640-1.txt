introduction human gut microbiome group microorganism consisting bacteria archaea eukarya number microorganism human gastrointestinal tract estimated male gut microbiome play major role maintaining host homeostasis modulating immune system metabolism study function microbiome critical understanding role microbiome human homeostasis disease pathogenesis specimen obtained human feces commonly used proxy human gut microbiome research fecal sampling method advantage noninvasive inexpensive convenient invasive method biopsy however detected composition fecal microbial community affected experimental design procedure including sampling method storage condition reference database used difference stool collection method contribute interstudy variability gut microbiome study utilize valid reproducible standardized method preserve microbiome composition enhance data comparability study shown gut microbiome change significantly storage ambient temperature result immediate freezing storage widely accepted best practice sequence-based analysis however immediate freezing using deep freezer usually impractical clinical setting alternative method storage room temperature 20–25
