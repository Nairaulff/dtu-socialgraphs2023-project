introduction background world biodiversity crisis emphasized lack understanding different stressor interaction affect specie population community last decade importance combined exposure chemical parasitic stressor including pathogenic virus fungi bacteria organism health gained increasing recognition attention mainly devoted improve method controlling pest agricultural setting controlling insect vector human disease reducing mortality beneficial insect hence well known one stressor may render organism sensitive second stressor environmental pollutant may interact natural infection resulting effect readily predictable neither ecology organism parasite inherent toxicity pollutant lack predictability however largely due lack consistent use validated conceptual model predict organism response combination chemical parasitic stressor using model describing expected effect combination based knowledge effect single stressor applied individually make possible define effect larger predicted often termed synergy smaller predicted termed antagony simply follow model therefore predictable previous meta-analyses investigated frequency synergistic interaction mixture chemical using reference model concentration addition regulatory default model within area eco toxicology chemical stress however lack consensus model use come multiple stressor beyond field chemical stressor increasing number study combined exposure agro chemical parasite claim synergistic effect reference model used define synergy whether reference model used varies hence meta-analyses combined chemical parasitic stressor across scientific discipline ranging agronomy ecology using consistent model framework exist understanding model used predict effect multiple stressor essential ecology predict joint effect multiple stressor quantify proportional effect individual stressor multi-stressor scenario thereby identifying key stressor stressor interaction threatening local biodiversity addition quantifying ideally understanding interaction chemical parasitic stressor take place may help dual purpose fighting pest minimized use chemical pesticide ensuring healthy environment beneficial insect aim present meta-analysis therefore twofold first provide short overview available reference model ecology eco toxicology emphasis feature experimental design model choice affecting outcome meta-analysis secondly quantify frequency synergistic antagonistic interaction known anthropogenic chemical stressor natural infection possible subsequently define characteristic synergistic antagonistic combination well develop hypothesis concerning biological biochemical mechanism behind interactive effect meta-analysis focus arthropod group organism data available overview reference model predicting combined effect multiple stressor using model synergy antagony defined respectively significantly increased decreased observed effect combination two stressor compared predicted effect specific combination hence identify synergistic effect one must able predict effect non-synergistic joint effect two stressor purpose one must employ reference model assuming interaction null model schäfer piggott provides good overview null model used multiple stressor research across field ecology ecotoxicology assumption behind model summarized table using annotation schäfer piggott effect stressor described function stressor intensity chemical parasitic stress either dose/concentration chemical quantitative measure parasite load adverse effect case sigmoid possibly linear function stressor intensity common model assume interaction stressor predict joint effect one endpoint one point time table overview different null model two stressor commonly used name within ecological eco toxicological literature full size table biological system however dynamic time stressor effect occur many biological level ranging molecular individual population community level null

stressor different endpoint growth reproduction survival extension population level also attempted data required parameterization model however comprehensive study therefore still relatively rare purpose meta-analysis existing study combined effect chemical parasite simpler approach therefore needed choice term data requirement made first need endpoint sufficient data derived secondly need model theoretically justified finally choose appropriate time point assessing deviation null model study data multiple time point given three requirement discussed detail choice endpoint mortality frequently reported effect measure across stressor combination specie study combining chemical parasitic stressor arthropod therefore chosen endpoint meta-analysis study combining chemical parasitic stressor represent parasite known increase host mortality part transmission host fungi virus indicating host mortality appropriate endpoint however parasite rely host survival ensure transmission e.g helminth effect host fitness synergy chemical stressor may still present would subtle measured host mortality alone parasite sublethal endpoint growth reproduction would important include result used population model require long term study therefore rarely given effect parasitic stressor based host mortality therefore likely underestimation true effect combined effect parasite chemical stress mortality untreated uninfected control ideally zero ensure effect observed treatment caused treatment stressor however always case treatment mortality therefore often corrected control mortality choice reference model choice reference model guided endpoint monitored binary gradual mode action stressor assumption table stress imposed chemical exposure parasitic infection respectively likely affect different physiological process organism chemical stressor mainly act specific molecular target e.g specific enzyme receptor and/or elicit up-regulation specific detoxifying enzyme cytochrome p450s esterases transferase parasite infection likewise elicit immune response depending type infection immune system targeted organism inducible detoxification mechanism induced immune response energy demanding process repair process following tissue damage two type stress even though might physiological cross-talk detoxification system immune response parasite may release chemical providing similar response pure chemical exposure purpose choosing appropriate null model consider stress chemical parasite act independently binary endpoint mortality therefore choose multiplicative model meta-analysis follow ecotoxicological terminology table note multiplicative model doe describe physiological mechanism interaction parasite chemical rather provides tool identify whether unexpected interaction take place interaction tool predict effect combined stressor parasitic stress chemical stress mortality host organism reason choosing simple addition model table stressor intensity -effect relationship individual stressor knowledge sigmoid rather linear individual sensitivity consistently negatively correlated requested data used simple addition addition adding effect lead mortality biologically possible simple addition underestimate synergy compared multiplicative model add effect without subtracting product table however used recent meta-analysis agrochemicals nutritional

yielding specific effect using ratio observed predicted effect also doe make sense evaluating effect dividing small effect would make ratio towards infinity hence quantifying interaction effect data make sense simply quantify difference mortality survival subtracting observed predicted effect expressing difference increase decrease fraction dead survived individual fig thus aiming quantifying

limiting information may study involving parasite often make sequential observation mortality time hence purpose meta-analysis choose relevant time point quantify deviation observed predicted effect

lifetime population likely determining factor damage done crop and/or growth population minor difference observed time point second challenge determine stressor intensity deviation observed predicted effect quantified stressor intensity tested according fig low stressor intensity make likely detect synergistic interaction high stressor intensity would make likely detect antagonistic interaction
