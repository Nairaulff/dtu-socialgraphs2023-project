introduction coal mining indonesia mostly applies open pit mining method coal mining open pit mining method potential cause several environmental impact form water soil air managed correctly based applicable regulation mining operation land clearing overburden removal cause oxidation pyrite mineral lead formation amd amd already occurred must managed properly especially drainage accommodated sump operation void mine closure stage wastewater released public water body amd may formed potential acid forming paf material factor interfere growth revegetation reclamation process two technique amd management prevention technique controlling source generated amd remediation technique mitigation process previously produced amd term amd remediation active treatment generally considered costly passive treatment especially mining operation ceased mine abandoned gautama conducted study use lime neutralization process pit lake namely m23e coal mine south kalimantan amount acidic wastewater pit lake 8.2 million study reviewed implementation active treatment form in-pit treatment method carried pit lake field-scale experimental processing lime neutralize around 460,000 liquid waste 2.8 three month released public water cost incurred around usd 0.04 per acid water meet quality standard coal mine another million acid water must managed expensive still using active treatment passive treatment system component amd treatment strategy function either stand-alone treatment strategy pretreatment reduce cost active treatment passive treatment system performance varies significantly among constructed system due difference site condition passive treatment method generally achieve precipitation metal sulfide creating reducing condition utilizing organic substance alkaline agent including aerobic constructed wetland compost reactor constructed wetland promising passive treatment option relatively self-sustaining established deemed cost effective passive treatment system generally require longer retention time greater space markedly decrease long-term cost amd must managed better refers permit given coal mining wastewater must treated meet environmental quality
