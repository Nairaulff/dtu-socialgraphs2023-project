introduction emergency medical service hygiene measure take place within well-planned routine transport urgent time-sensitive demand acute emergency significant time pressure rapidly changing environment due unpredictability transmissible disease pathogen emergency situation well unavailability reliable preclinical information regarding presence threat consistent compliance fundamental hygiene measure becomes requirement across operation mean hygiene measure emergency service must fundamentally effective appropriate suitable situation feasible cost-efficient reason hygiene standard

comprehensive disinfection contact surface instance case ambulance widely used strobel aalen system germany task demand approximately complete time medical specialist unavailable immediate medical procedure often urgently required instead carry basic medical procedure two hour specific instance direct contamination leakage blood pressurized vein placement peripheral indwelling access limited disinfection small surface practical disinfection performed within minute incomparable extensive periodic disinfection process indicated disinfection small surface secondary tertiary prevention precisely indicated occurrence contamination effectively carried immediately short time great uncertainty regard periodic disinfection sense primary prevention i.e general reduction infection risk without directly knowing cause decisive difference indicated disinfection small surface must specifically cover small manageable area usually precisely known therefore point view systematic technical hygiene periodic disinfection considering time axis man-power performing non-validated quantity therefore considered uncertain absence method periodic disinfection/basic disinfection possible date time-consuming never completely feasible due nature application human bias/wetting gap due wipe therefore process validated unsafe point discrepancy accepted considering patient risk mortality
