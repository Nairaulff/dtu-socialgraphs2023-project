introduction karasek demand-control model predicts mental strain result interaction job demand job decision latitude control according model combination low decision latitude heavy job demand associated mental strain therefore reduction mental strain achieved redesigning work process allow increase control without reducing job demand workload associated organizational output level following karasek proposal numerous intervention study tested model since focused mainly control-dimension model demand however recent contribution elovainio suggested shifting focus demand-dimension target intervention analysis psychosocial work environment identified job demand one core factor could constitute valuable target workplace intervention improving central upstream factor job demand could result spread positive influence also part psychosocial network evidence dynamic job demand could allow informed decision intervene improve work environment occupational wellbeing constructing scale job demand karasek defined job demand follows goal constructing scale job demand measure psychological stressor involved accomplishing workload stressor related unexpected task stressor job-related personal conflict. previous research utilizing karasek model demand-dimension analyzed mostly relying survey based employee subjective perception work survey based following feature work fast work hard lot work enough time excessive work time finish conflicting demand validity perceived information psychosocial factor demand control collected questionnaire evaluated exposure study according solovieva validity perceived information job demand weak argued need detailed information job demand study still utilize perceived detailed information available need objective information job demand job analysis organizational record pointed several contribution rare example rau used objective information job demand exploring association job demand depression information job demand based task diagnosis survey according rau method could considered objective job analysis expert rate work characteristic independently employee perception his/her work task able show objectively defined demand significantly associated depression spector pindek pointed digital big data could constitute new source information work work environment organization data-driven approach utilizing big data source could potential yield valuable insight many organizational phenomenon approach could used recognize pattern data predict important outcome illness injury addition need objective information job demand also need dynamic process-like information could capture characteristic contemporary work observe process one requires temporal sequence must contain beginning end intermediate step although survey information often longitudinal also static gathered certain time point using survey data possible discover process work way enabled timestamped trace data information trace data timestamp making possible discover temporal progression activity process contemporary work life accomplishing workload increasingly occurs aid information system use leaf trace log data system trace understood information job demand trace data possible define event containing four feature timestamp actor target action example target action pair found trace data could message_sent use trace data analysis temporal pattern approached pragmatic action-oriented framework focus pattern emerge agentic action thus avoiding overtly structural abstract theorizing digital trace data also approached perspective critical realism recognizes trace data by-product monitored activity used empirically observe actual event generated real mechanism specific contextual environment following perspective combined powerful computational method digital trace data seen important indicator work demand trace data possible get action-oriented context-specific information practical content work activity
