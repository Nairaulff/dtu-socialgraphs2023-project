specie eutardigrada heterotardigrada taxon reported region genus paramacrobiotus guidetti currently comprises formally named specie formally erected based morphological genetic analysis morphologically two distinct specie group present genus one exhibiting microplacoid within pharynx i.e richtersi group second one without microplacoid i.e areolatus group phenotypic difference led kaczmarek propose two group constitute separate subgenus specific name clarified marley however erection subseqently questioned independently based two phylogenetic analysis within genus
