introduction fermented meat produced worldwide due sensory characteristic convenience great variety fermented meat constitutes important part cultural patrimony fermented meat product unique flavor texture long shelf life natural artificial condition promoted microorganism meat protein decomposed microorganism enzyme produce large number amino acid improves nutrition flavor fermented meat fermented meat four flavor development method used protein degradation lipid oxidation maillard reaction use microorganism however traditional natural fermentation difficult normalize fermented meat quality ensure safety therefore improve product quality reduce production difficulty artificial inoculation microorganism better ensure safety stability fermented meat lactic acid bacteria lab microorganism widely used production fermented meat product lab fermented meat inhibit growth reproduction pathogenic spoilage bacteria also lowering content harmful substance like nitrite lactiplantibacillus plantarum streptococcus xylosus fermented sausage promoted protein fat decomposition inhibiting growth pathogenic spoilage bacteria prevent odor rancidity maintain sausage quality improve flavor lactobacillus sake example promote lipid hydrolysis inhibit lipid autoxidation improve fermented flavor development term flavor development lab carbohydrate energy source produce organic acid moreover lab promote protein decomposition positively affect amino acid metabolism promote development fermented meat flavor addition lab beneficial increasing content free fatty acid fermented meat product particularly promote release unsaturated fatty acid provide basic material flavor development therefore lab play important role functional starter resulting unique flavor safe fermented meat quorum sensing cell density-dependent type communication mechanism mediated molecule molecule also called autoinducers enable bacteria collectively regulate gene expression thereby
