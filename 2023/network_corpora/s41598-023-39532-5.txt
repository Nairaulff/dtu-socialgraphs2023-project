incident dementia persisted patient year noted study design used adjustment risk factor disease medication exposure type outcome cause dementia versus vascular dementia alzheimer disease differed study prohibiting adequate direct comparison effect estimate study many specific risk-factors put forward explain observed age-dependant effect first suggested atherosclerosis resulting high blood pressure cerebral hypoperfusion related severe atherosclerosis low blood pressure could explain pathway linking high blood pressure younger patient low blood pressure older adult cognitive decline dementia additionally could also explained complex perspective age-associated change cardiovascular structure cross talk blood pressure variability thickening stiffening large artery develop aging due collagen calcium deposition loss elastic fiber medial layer left ventricle modest concentric wall thickening occurs ageing due cellular hypertrophy arterial change cause systolic blood pressure rise age diastolic blood pressure generally decline resulting increased pulse pressure variability simultaneous multi-organ dysfunction defined simultaneous occurrence left ventricular hypertrophy common carotid artery disease increased thickness chronic kidney disease associated low diastolic blood pressure rather systolic hypertension decrease diastolic blood pressure age might explain damageable systolic hypertension explaining decrease association hypertension dementia age however study hypertension dyslipidemia associated dementia risk adjusted risk factor disease second higher cholesterol value associated decreased dementia risk late life may indirectly indicate better overall health status older patient third might reverse causality age-dependant effect hypertension dyslipidemia diabetes blood pressure cholesterol glucose level may drop onset neurodegenerative process hypothesis generalizable risk factor may explain observed age-dependent effect well first may selective survival patient likely develop dementia consequence risk factor second higher prevalence risk factor non-cv risk factor dementia elderly patient attenuates distinction patient without risk factor nonetheless similar decrease dementia risk observed additional adjustment risk factor disease included study performed non-cv risk factor may confound observation third patient risk factor may die earlier without risk factor consequently likely develop dementia death notwithstanding adjusting mortality competing risk led similar result study risk risk factor disease incident dementia diminishes increasing age except hypertension dyslipidemia fourth neuropathological study shown vascular risk burden predictive vascular dementia cortical infarct subcortical infarct atherosclerosis arteriosclerosis alzheimer disease braak stage cerebral amyloid angiopathy neuritic plaque score however neuropathological study also revealed late life presence multiple pathology alzheimer disease microinfarcts hippocampal sclerosis lewy body disease macroinfarcts cerebral amyloid angiopathy white matter disease others associated increased risk dementia accordingly observed decreasing risk risk factor disease incident dementia increasing age might due fact studied outcome all-cause dementia presence multiple pathology rather vascular dementia seems involved development age increase fifth taking account risk level risk prediction dementia longitudinal data since improvement modifiable risk associated reduction dementia risk finally take account impact level adherence medication study one largest examine effect age risk risk factor disease incidence dementia population ranging year strength limitation study greatly related nature quebec ramq administrative database single payer public health care system quebec canada quebec ramq administrative database includes individual year old limiting selection bias capture diagnosis procedure drug however several limitation must taken consideration first administrative claim data depend exhaustive accurate recording coding diagnosis procedure drug second observational study administrative data might subject confounding bias unadjusted factor e.g. auto-immune disease pro-inflammatory condition race level education smoking sedentary lifestyle major depressive disorder etc. third administrative claim data depend exhaustive accurate recording coding diagnosis procedure fourth accurate starting risk factor disease may always accurately recorded administrative claim data duration disorder could accounted used 5-year period ass risk risk factor disease fifth distinction type dementia performed type dementia reliably specified administrative claim data sixth quantitative measurement blood pressure glucose cholesterol available could take account appropriate control hypertension diabetes mellitus cholesterol seventh patient may included one age group follow-up order consider cohort risk according age-group may introduce survival bias thus provided sensitivity analysis using competing risk correcting mortality led similar result risk factor dementia exhibit similar result stratifying sex across age-groups last could adjust factor economic health status severity disease lifestyle education could also linked dementia risk conclusion found strength association risk factor disease incidence dementia change age except hypertension dyslipidemia diabetes stroke main risk factor dementia burden dementia diminishes increasing age year except future research clinical initiative pay special attention age-related impact different risk factor disease incidence dementia result also suggest dementia may explained different pathophysiological process young-old vs. old-old adult
