introduction phoronid horseshoe worm phylum phoronida marine invertebrate whose life cycle usually involves pelagic larva benthic sessile adult bore soft sediment hard substrate like rock mollusc shell phoronid filter-feed using arch tentacle lophophore protect vermiform trunk chitinous tube excreted epidermal gland sometimes enriched particulate material surroundings phylum contains described specie occupies still debated phylogenetic position within lophotrochozoa—a key group understanding evolution protostome deuterostome metazoan recent effort dramatically expanded number invertebrate phylum targeted microbiome analysis highlighted importance environmental factor shaping animal-associated bacterial community composition general effect host taxonomy appear minimal phylum relatively bacterial sequence variant seem truly host-specific environmental condition like water temperature seasonality also known affect microbiome larger filter-feeders like bivalve show variation tissue individual bacteria isolated environment also direct implication planktonic larva including phoronid serving ecological usher inducing substrate-specific metamorphosis within phoronid isolated report bacteria inside lophophore in-between microvilli body wall associated specific layer tube within specialised nerve cell larva however identity function bacteria remain unknown standing fast-growing
