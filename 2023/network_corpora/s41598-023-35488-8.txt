introduction many european country facing growing prevalence type diabetes estimated 7–11 austrian population suffer diabetes estimate increasing time next reduced quality life diabetes often cause severe complication cardiovascular disease renal failure blindness neuropathy amputation prevalence diabetes complication expected increase even due ageing population resulting severe growing burden individual patient health care system recent research found regional difference diabetes prevalence within across several country instance germany regional heterogeneity captured within diabetes atlas within diab-core study national level recently exact data diabetes prevalence missing austria still lack national registry adult diabetes current information derived local registry fragmented datasets health survey based data drug prescription preventive medical check-ups recent report international diabetes federation estimated based in-country data source adult aged 20–79 year diabetes number 447.1 thousand age-adjusted comparative prevalence 4.6 lower shown last report partly due different data source methodology estimation 5.9 diagnosed 3.6 undiagnosed case reported however estimation derived health survey recent evaluation screening test austria revealed decreasing trend newly diagnosed diabetes case 1.8 data incidence generally scarce reliable data incidence available patient

discontinue antihyperglycemic treatment least year assumed group without drug regular monitoring corresponds patient lifestyle therapy even expect subject adhere healthy lifestyle diet exercise manage glycemia fact glycemic monitoring including regular hba1c measurement discontinued concerning standard diabetes care recommend hba1c testing least two time year patient meeting treatment goal stable glycemic control patient meet glycemic goal therapy modification quarterly test fact even alarming patient discontinued monitoring and/or drug therapy erratic patient also showed significantly higher mortality patient regular continuous care although neither cause mortality patient known causality discontinued management mortality evidenced exclude kind association clinical point view erratic patient complicate measurement diabetes incidence prevalence rate classifying incident lead increase incidence age sex group whereas properly accounting patient result decrease incidence time work therefore present model-based approach ensures erratic patient discontinued treatment erroneously counted incident standardized incidence rate vary factor across individual district regional difference diabetes prevalence previously described higher prevalence east country well difference based sex education occupation current analysis confirms regional difference prevalence rate across austria report incidence broken district austria first time incidence map reveals cluster high incidence west country last year higher rate usually seen urban area highest rate metropolis vienna surrounding area east–west gradient may due healthy lifestyle lower socioeconomic situation higher migration background population east diabetes independently predicted geographic location psycho-social stress lack physical activity age sex austria previous analysis however trend may changing appears current analysis new cluster high incidence west deserve careful surveillance austrian health survey statistik austria reported somewhat lower diabetes prevalence 4.7 vs. 5.5 incidence incidence rate derived medical preventive check-ups showed slight decrease 2.3 1.8 newly diagnosed diabetes case incidence estimate calculated new prescription antihyperglycemic drug comparison one year date therefore previous estimation relied partial information could give comprehensive picture diabetes prevalence incidence austria current study consistent increase diabetes prevalence rate found could ascribed better diagnosis longer life expectancy patient diabetes austria last decade country including prevalence rate remained high level last year incidence rate even showed trend toward decrease displaying great variability interestingly germany based analysis national insurance data decrease incidence rate recently estimated men woman 2.4 1.7 per year regional variation however author observed increase incidence rate population year study austria trend decreasing incidence rate sex age group observed pattern ceased thereafter woman incidence tended increase last year except oldest subgroup increased incidence early onset type diabetes recently recognized growing global health problem systematic analysis global burden disease study moreover greater disease burden woman aged year evidenced another study showed high risk early onset type diabetes woman degree glucose intolerance pregnancy frequent complication pregnancy also austria unfortunately report possible trend early onset type diabetes hyperglycemia pregnancy austria patient older year included analysis therefore assumed real number incident diabetes case underestimated current analysis nevertheless type diabetes still rare child adolescent austria contrary current trend youth-onset type diabetes usa especially ethnic minority china trend alarming early onset diabetes shown associated higher risk developing early complication diabetes note analysis would observed increasing trend incidence population older year would classified patient incident instead erratic upon treatment reinitiation explored alternative model formulation referred nidx model measurement adjust erratic patient would result slight significant increase incidence time max 1.2 thus modeling analysis give important new insight diabetes care potential impact health policy comparing erratic group patient diabetes continuous antihyperglycemic treatment revealed predominance female erratic group although explanation finding could speculated woman stopped medication often suffered side effect drug therapy prefered try lifestyle modification alone instead additional drug therapy furthermore erratic patient appear healthier often exhibit common risk factor like hypertension dyslipidemia obesity diabetes-related important comorbidities like cardiovascular renal disease cardiometabolic medication psychological disease depression also often diagnosed non-erratic group however comorbidities derived hospital stay observation period underestimation comorbidities supposed underestimation may particularly exist erratic group possibly due health problem help seeking behavior accepting medical care although clarify point lower number comorbidities may ascribed better health status erratic patient leading lower drug adherence clinical inertia could also change treatment plan focus lifestyle suspending medication would plausible glycemic control improved weight reduction stopping medication counteracts insulin diminishes insulin secretion e.g glucocorticoid diuretic due temporary resolution diabetogenic condition e.g severe illness endocrine disease however rate glucocorticoid prescription even somewhat lower erratic group furthermore well known patient predisposed diabetes commonly show deterioration metabolism increasing age therefore could need antihyperglycemic medication time fact observed higher mortality rate erratic group patient regular medication alarming contradicts hypothesis better health status specific group observation concerning deserves investigation several explanation increase incidence rate next natural degree fluctuation observation could ascribed fact higher age many patient undiagnosed diabetes detected hospital diabetes-related complication like myocardial infarction stroke kidney disease know e.g one third patient myocardial infarction hyperglycemia unknown event study subject several limitation identified diabetes patient based dispensals antihyperglycemic medication number hba1c measurement information blood glucose hba1c level available neither diagnosis information extramural care outpatient visit available austria prescription medication cost eur 4,70 also contained data however effect antihyperglycemics considered work also information socio-economic indicator clinical parameter body mass index smoking status quality glycemic control lifestyle factor like nutrition exercise 60,000 patient removed due missing information antidiabetic treatment might also bias result used dataset curated austrian health agency leicon also subject several limiations due construction see also diabetes patient identified drug prescription hba1c measurement standardized icd-10 coding austrian outpatient sector meaning possible directly distinguish type diabetes type diabetes particular patient age 50y received insulin prescription atc code starting a10a excluded leicon dataset due higher likelihood type diabetes younger diabetes patient therefore restrict analysis patient aged validation analysis found leicon dataset identified type diabetes patient sensitivity specificity conclusion incidence type diabetes strongly depends age sex place residency correcting erratic patient diabetes slight decrease total diabetes incidence concomitant increase diabetes prevalence observed probably owing aging population large group patient fluctuate antihyperglycemic therapy monitoring deserves study
