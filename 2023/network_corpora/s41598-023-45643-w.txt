introduction selection desirable genotype progeny perhaps important activity plant animal breeding program selection efficiency depends largely genetic diversity population heritability studied trait selection often effective trait high heritability compared low heritability since one important goal breeding program obtain high-yielding plant hand direct selection yield quantitative trait effective controlled many gene low heritability correlation study plant determined yield high positive negative correlation trait high heritability trait controlled small number gene besides success indirect selection depends mainly magnitude direction positive negative association correlation coefficient trait interest trait better use indirect selection improve yield interested trait selection based morphological trait high measurement accuracy relatively high heritability may quick way screen plant population improve yield quantitative trait reason using index effective improving trait also index one best method simultaneous breeding trait breeding program selection made trait simultaneously using total score index net merit individual constructed combining score component character individual highest score kept breeding purpose since trait considered selection may equally important economically type weighting required unless appropriate weighting adopted trait receive much others little attention amount weight given trait depends relative economic value heritability genetic phenotypic correlation different trait choosing superior progeny plant population affect progeny trait heavily influenced environment often correlate therefore selection based one trait identify superior genotype may slightly effective due low heritability use selection index increase chance success breeding program simultaneously different trait identify superior genotype various information experimental unit used selection index index ability based complex economic value breeder interest trait increase genetic value economic return crop plant mostly determined several trait value plant breeder study simultaneous selection numerous trait maximize plant economic value although number trait affect efficiency selection index number trait higher efficiency using statistical technique obtain necessary information indirect selection trait improve yield among technique mention
