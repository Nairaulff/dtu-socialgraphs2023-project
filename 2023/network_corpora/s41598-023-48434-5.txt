introduction china stated seek reach peak emission carbon neutrality public conversation united nation general committee 75th session september achieve commitment china halt destructive activity coastal wetland conserve function structure existing coastal aquatic system rehabilitate strengthen blue carbon role reap benefit carbon sequestration conserving environment china aggressively persistently encourages restoration construction coastal wetland ecosystem e.g. mangrove restoration mangrove ecosystem one carbon-rich inter-tidal community tropical subtropical area higher deposition rate low methane emission making crucial global carbon cycle climate change mitigation although mangrove ecosystem make 0.5 coastal land 0.1 total land area generate 10–15 coastal sediment carbon storage besides organic carbon plant soil within blue carbon ecosystem already identified potentially important climate mitigation option therefore essential accurately evaluate carbon stock mangrove ecosystem better understanding global carbon cycle previous study demonstrated large proportion –90 mangrove ecosystem carbon accumulated soil carbon storage mangrove forest hainan 16.81 soil
