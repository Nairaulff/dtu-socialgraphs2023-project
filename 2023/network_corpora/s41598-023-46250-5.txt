introduction chikungunya commonly known chikungunya fever chikf serious public health problem caused chikungunya virus chikv initially found tanzania infiltrated worldwide health system last seven decade name derived makonde phrase describes bent position people suffering severe arthralgia caused infection chikf mosquito-borne arbovirus spread aedes aegypti since also aedes albopictus mosquito last year new vector invaded almost every country worldwide infection usually manifest fever acute incapacitating joint pain progress prolonged painful arthritis last month year person recovered likely immune disease thailand first case chikf infection reported bangkok first case asia subsequently sporadic case chikf detected many location across thailand unclear long transmission persisted low level period relatively case reported possibly sign symptom chikf similar dengue result incident may often documented either diagnosis also thailand epidemiological surveillance report include

large-scale outbreak reappeared 2018–2020 outbreak started satun province predominantly rural region border northern malaysia unfortunately specific antiviral treatment effective vaccination therefore treatment supportive chikv potential cause large outbreak high attack rate potentially overburdening healthcare system affecting one-third three-quarters population area virus circulating large-scale outbreak potential spread disease across country worldwide previously non-endemic area location provide suitable environmental condition autochthonous chikv transmission aedes albopictus aedes aegypti specie mosquito carrier virus aedes albopictus predominates rural area aedes aegypti urban area therefore case common urbanized rural area mosquito carry disease often venture feed daytime meaning age

previously described method applied rare disease data contains large proportion zero approach developed study used identify area high chikf occurrence incidence rate among susceptible person allowing public health official prevent impending epidemic gender first outbreak occurrence increased age 20–29 decreased age incidence rate increased age decreased age occurrence second outbreak female increased age 30–39 decreased gender age older incidence rate second outbreak increased age except female declined around age older chikf epidemic 10-year cycle peak majority sub-districts narathiwat songkhla pattani province above-average occurrence incidence rate occurrence first outbreak increased early adulthood decreased age result consistent study conducted india revealed majority case found among aged 15–44 majority young adult area work rubber plantation spend majority time outside increasing risk getting chikf hand incidence rate first outbreak increased age decreased age finding consistent bureau epidemiology official record revealed 45–64 age group highest incidence may due fact older age obviously risk group development arthralgia infected patient unable receive adequate treatment home transferred hospital furthermore elderly lower immune response younger people making prone illness older person may underlying health issue diabetes cardiovascular disease weaken immune system make vulnerable chikungunya consequence outbreak chikf occurs age group could occur high number infection second outbreak occurrence peaked adolescence early adult group decrease aged older may due fact population afflicted disease within last decade therefore lack protective antibody discovered chikv show long-term persistence neutralizing antibody human population northern eastern thailand year infection result majority infection case occurred adolescence early adult first round incidence chikf outbreak increased age decreased age whereas second round incidence increased age male decreased age female finding consistent official report bureau epidemiology indicated age group highest incidence prevalence considered chikf prevalent among young adult whereas incidence increase age group may participated fewer outdoor activity contact risk group whose rate decreased age group finding revealed 10-year cycle chikf outbreak finding affirms finding chusri al. found large-scale chikf outbreak occurred second large-scale outbreak reported year first outbreak indicates 10-year disease cycle also identified italian study according world health organization chikf epidemic follow cyclical pattern interepidemic period 4–8 year occasionally year smaller number people affected second outbreak 2018–2020 compared first outbreak 2008–2010 prior known strain chikf circulating thailand belonged asian lineage outbreak caused introduction east central south african lineage chikf isolates outbreak carried a226v point mutation shown increase vector specificity aedes albopictus second outbreak hand different genotype first resulting dramatically increased incidence chikf southernmost province study limitation firstly analysis result study may influenced fact case chikf data confirmed laboratory test however chikf case laboratory confirmed physician unsure laboratory confirmation mostly done chikf epidemic began 2008–2010 2018–2020 secondly patient fewer symptom may seek hospital care patient rural area may seek health care could lead underreporting data used study thirdly environmental factor including temperature humidity land use land cover well mosquito data including container index house index breteau index reported significant impact chikf outbreak considered study conclusion two large-scale chikf outbreak occurred following 10-year cycle outbreak occurrence chikf decreased year age older first outbreak year earlier second outbreak age older except aged older first outbreak female second outbreak incidence chikf outbreak increased age occurrence incidence region affected first outbreak tended disappear fewer problem second outbreak suggesting person immune illness infected chikf identifying issue region approached combination occurrence incidence rate therefore problem area assigned appropriate measure policy study needed duration immunity chikf epidemic non-infected area
