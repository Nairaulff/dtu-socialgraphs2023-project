introduction haemonchus contortus major gastrointestinal nematode affect small ruminant health welfare consequently production performance especially tropic subtropics region world pathophysiology contortus infection well described notably change biochemical property gastrointestinal environment indeed like nematode parasite colonizing gastrointestinal tract contortus manipulates microhabitat favor survival increase reproduction maintain ecological niche restriction regulation gastric key physiological mechanism maintenance gastrointestinal homeostasis ruminant many study showed gastrointestinal nematode infection associated increased abomasal consequently increase anaerobic microbial mass abomasum strong positive correlation egg excretion increased abomasal shown earlier contortus infected lamb lamb mammal shelter great variety commensal microbe notably colonize mucosal surface different tract including digestive respiratory reproductive tract gastrointestinal nematode intestinal bacteria share microhabitat thus interact host interestingly human increased diversity gut microbiota associated helminth colonization suggesting role parasite diversity structure

physiology including inflammatory response increased mucosal permeability modification biochemical property luminal environment suggested parasite would modify ecological niche favor survival fitness thus several study reported strong evidence gastrointestinal nematode infection associated increased abomasal ruminant underlying mechanism described inhibition abomasal acid secretion mediated gastrointestinal nematode associated parietal cell dysfunction thereby inducing elevation similarly study showed goat early day post-infection contrortus abomasal increased significantly remained high

hypothesized clostridia would involved maintenance overall gut function releasing butyrate end-product fermentation two alternative pathway butyrate kinase butyryl-coa acetate-coa transferase

butyrate-producing bacteria found goat day post-infection contortus different result underline complex dynamic relationship gastrointestinal nematode microbiota host mucosal immune response besides shown sheep goat contortus trichostrongylus colubriformis teladorsagia circumcincta infection increased abundance genus prevotella respectively ruminal fecal abomasal microbiota increased abundance prevotella abomasum associated nematode infection remain unclear indeed hypothesis compensatory mechanism face protein deficiency due infection line understanding mechanism microbiota-mediated proteo- peptidolysis mainly performed rumen present study result showed decrease prevotella abundance associated contortus infection mouse host-gastrointestinal parasite interaction model investigated ruminant decrease genus prevotella observed study nematode infection low number study conducted date doe allow thorough discussion apparently contradictory result many factor could implicated different feed regimen allocated study since shown recently particle length neutral detergent fiber ndf feed influenced rumen bacterial community structure genetic background host different time infection could also implicated therefore necessary strengthen research effort close interaction gastrointestinal parasite microbiota indeed altogether result suggest gastrointestinal parasite would exert immuno-modulatory activity partly indirect way altering structure microbiota
