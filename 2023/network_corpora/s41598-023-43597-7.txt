introduction recent decade witnessed publication promotion promising research result regarding therapeutic potential psychedelic drug particularly relation psychedelic-assisted therapy treatment mental illness psychedelics however much commonly used outside research setting thus emphasis positive outcome controlled study may present misleadingly over-generalized positive picture effect psychedelics growing global industry illegal semi-legal fully legal psychedelic retreat care service particularly europe america moreover evidence suggests increasing number individual struggling mental health condition seeking self-medicate psychedelics epidemiological data suggests sizeable increase prevalence psychedelic-use last year questionnaire based sampling naturalistic use psychedelics tended yield positive finding mental health benefit vs. risk e.g. however self-selection confirmation bias may skewed finding direction moreover approach may inadvertently under-sample underwhelming iatrogenic response e.g. due attrition bias although see high rate level promissory messaging linked therapeutic potential psychedelics raised awareness topic e.g. due impactful journalism recently received counteraction form critical perspective mainstream medium production also taken predominantly negative focus psychedelic medicine claiming risk negative response under-represented recognising cultural sub-cultural bias favour positive effect psychedelics may contributed positive research outcome e.g. via self-selecting recruitment confirmation bias also sought counter potential bias designing study explicitly exclusively focus negative response psychedelics chose focus negative psychological outcome specifically endure greater post use—i.e. refer long-term negative psychological response unpleasant acute psychological experience psychedelics rare—even research environment example one notable study reported approximately prevalence moderate severe anxiety panic distress high dose psilocybin healthy volunteer colloquially experience referred bad trip formally defined measured challenging experience presently unclear however experience relate long-term psychological outcome example evidence —and reasoning—suggests may necessarily foreshadow worsening mental health outcome indeed so-called emotional breakthrough experience psychedelics robustly reliably predict improvement mental health outcome across study sample yet breakthrough typically feature degree resistance struggle aversive psychological state given ambiguous impact challenging acute psychedelic experience sought focus negative mental health presentation arising worsening psychedelic use prevalence mental health iatrogenesis post psychedelic use appears low negligible prevalence doe appear lower controlled research study moreover consistent long-held assumption iatrogenic response appear highly—if entirely—context dependent importance set setting

construct usefully expanded betty eisner emphasised role psychosocial matrix shaping long-term response psychedelics baseline characterological mental health presentation also likely important predictor response example personality type psychiatric disorder could contraindication psychedelic use general—as well standard psychedelic therapy approach low prevalence doe equal low relevance however rare severe case still negatively impact individual lives—with reverberation family member others addition adverse reaction psychedelics could affect success medical development initiative involving psychedelics especially given politically divisive history associated compound present approach focusing severe long-term negative psychological response seen consistent extreme value analysis science could motivate greater effort better understand—in order prevent—rare important negative psychological response psychedelics present study used two-phase design featuring online questionnaire semi-structured interview approach examine case negative psychological response psychedelics aim better understanding nature might occurred particular interest case emerging worsening

interviewed participant therefore retrospectively added list symptom categorized emerging symptom flashback acute psychedelic experience derealization disconnection including sense stigmatization flashback acute psychedelic experience described derealization interviewed participant p10 p20 p22 p23 p28 i.e. spoke derealization described example daily out-of-body-experiences p20 reality felt thin unstable completely disconnected universe p10 p23 said derealization… like something wrong normal world p23 disconnection including sense stigmatization p10 p15 p25 p26 i.e. described feeling isolated mental health problem following psychedelic experience example one person described …this fundamental sense aloneness like one help i´m slipping hell soul alone completely disconnected universe p10 talk people crazy sense isolation critical judgement described anxiety-provoking worse actual symptom kind vilification hppd much symptom isolation. p26 difficulty asking professional help due stigma related psychedelics also mentioned three participant p25 p15 flashback acute psychedelic experience p10 p12 p15 p20 p22 p23 p24 p26 p28 i.e. reported prolonged adverse response felt similar and/or connected unpleasant e.g. frightening psychedelic experience described connection term flashback emotional flashback —implying ptsd-like intrusive psychological reoccurrence experienced trauma individual perpetual psychological struggle linked actual drug experience still ongoing participated study eleven participant used classic psychedelic described acute experience overtly negative and/or frightening one anomalous case experiencing anxiety-provoking flashback psychedelic experience talked participant used mdma described acute experience pleasant positive maybe important point hearing music took mdma still felt like deep listening music suddenly great anxiety one second another overwhelming yeah stop two three days. p23 reported flashback triggered cue reminded psychedelic experience others memory could arise without obvious trigger e.g. p28 onset symptom occurred directly psychedelic experience e.g. p28 although participant symptom started week p15 month psychedelic experience moreover one p25 participant used classic psychedelic described positive acute experience lsd reported symptom hppd visual disturbance main prolonged adverse response anxiety secondary symptom caused hppd theme association overtly challenging acute experience subsequent prolonged adverse psychological response however otherwise reliable example one participant p22 described psychedelic experience saw traumatic event including violence rape personally experienced life saw externalized perspective i.e. saw body described experience extremely frightening although already knowing thing happened seeing outside compounded significance event described overwhelming reported experiencing extreme anxiety flashback nightmare perceived agoraphobia many year afterwards individual interviewed around year drug experience symptom ceased said experience changed many respect thus effect seems one re-traumatization recovery traumatic material psychotherapeutically processed risk factor thematic analysis led identification four potential risk factor several subthemes within shown table table theme potential risk factor full size table drug pattern use a.1 unknown unusually high quantity course unknown quantity purity almost unavoidable consequence illegal status associated lack regulatory quality-control psychedelics—and therefore represents risk created drug policy thing consumed higher dosage likely increase risk adverse event dose dependency adverse event true psychedelics—with different risk becoming likely different substance e.g. psychological risk classic psychedelics toxicity risk higher dos mdma majority interviewed participant either uncertain dose taken reported taken dose unusually large compared taken one participant p24 earlier interview described sensitive lsd said following dosing event thought led prolonged adverse psychological response gotten vial lsd friend mine really excited try woken like two morning 2–3 sleep excited back sleep started taking one drop vial every hour probably could total like high dose lsd. p24 a.2 frequent use prior event four participant p24 p25 reported frequent use month year prior event thought triggered adverse response example it´s took day also taken day week before. p25 kept taking substance kind got point really couldn´t anymore would negative would adverse started panic attacks. p24 a.3 questionable drug purity quality quality drug always known participant p20 reported dosed will—thus knowing anything drug later comparing phenomenology experience report concluding likely dmt received p24 received lsd questionable source i.e. friend made however stated earlier scenario likely norm illegal use psychedelics due lack regulatory quality-control hindsight bias—and deflecting explanation convenience—could also contribute laying blame drug quality actually key contributing factor a.4 polysubstance use including prescribed medication and/or discontinuing medication abruptly four interviewed participant p15 p22 p28 26.7 used psychedelic combination psychedelic- non-psychedelic drug one p28 also combination prescribed risperidone i.e. antipsychotic medication another participant shortly experience decided discontinue prescribed adhd medication see fig supplementary information information drug used together addition survey completers reported mixing drug personal- family history psychiatric disorder mental health issue personal mental health b.1 personal history diagnosed psychiatric disorder prior experience four interviewed participant reported psychiatric diagnosis prior experience includes attention deficit hyperactive disoder adhd major depressive disorder mdd mdd past although recovered p12 severe depression psychotic feature p28 bulimia p23 b.2 personal history undiagnosed mental health problem prior experience another six participant reported struggling variety undiagnosed mental health issue prior including undiagnosed seasonal affective disorder pretty standard occasional anxiety p10 eating disorder p12 trauma instability family bad mental health p22 visual snow p25 anxiety p26 taking antidepressant medication past p12 hence interviewed participant i.e. reported form mental health problem—diagnosed undiagnosed b.3 post experience formal diagnosis five participant talked experienced mental health difficulty psychedelic experience claimed symptom exacerbated formally diagnosed experience two participant p24 diagnosed bipolar disorder shortly psychedelic experience family history bipolar believed pre-existing attenuated symptom prior experience diagnosis received experience although participant reported symptom present prior included depression p15 p23 anxiety p15 p23 borderline ptsd binge eating disorder ptsd psychotic feature p20 one reported entirely new psychiatric disorder emerge experience essentially non-existent i.e. even p25 reported visual snow prior high-dose 400mcg lsd experience mental health immediate family b.4 family history diagnosed psychiatric disorder three participant p24 talked family member diagnosed bipolar disorder—as mentioned one individual went diagnosis bipolar disorder shortly psychedelic experience p24 b.5 family history undiagnosed mental health problem eight participant talked family member undiagnosed mental health problem taken together two i.e. interviewed individual reported personal family history either diagnosed undiagnosed mental health problem thus deduction interviewed sample personal family history psychiatric illness negative unsafe expectations/environment c.1 unsafe environment stressful incident happening experience participant talked environment feel safe e.g. group friend know well feel fully comfortable p22 others talked incident happening experience pivoted psychedelic experience negative direction latter example someone sharing experience started struggling p26 p28 well kicked someone parent house timepoint drug effect beginning intensify p28 one participant reported overall pleasant experience lsd happened see face mirror …and saw just… really explain kind of… looked like kind evil witch evil thing know kind shattered sanity looking pretty inexperienced know supposed accept thing basically trying bad trip foothold sanity grasp onto anything nothing experiencing perceiving seemed stable like looked mirror remember thinking heard supposed look mirror reason decided anyway think maybe negative expectation head. another participant p20 dosed sexually abused experience diagnosed ptsd psychotic feature after—and result of—the experience said following like smoking joint friend really frightening idea going like repeat say god like god like point like incoherent extreme visual effect more… vibrational closed eye kind entire body like vibrating terror absolutely terrible felt like dying like speaking figure figure basically was… showing entire life experienced life review life flashed eye happening sexually assaulted absolutely terrible woke kind like happening ended sober lucid. p20 c.2 negative priming participant cited apprehensive negative expectation contributing causal factor example p23 described prior negative bias psychedelics decided try attempt understand boyfriend better p10 described experience negatively primed difficult ayahuasca ceremony night thought kind primed it… like something physical overwhelming i.e. referring ceremony night think also led second night complete hell yeah think went little fear. p10 c.3 stressful time major life change surrounding trip seven participant reported experiencing significant life stress around time experience well stressful and/or traumatic event transpiring example ranged stress uncertainty professional life p12 p15 currently working difficult past experience therapy p12 feeling well day p24 uncertainty romantic relationship p16 p23 recent p22 unprocessed p15 breakup problem interpersonal relation d.1 relationship tension present experience five participant described taking psychedelic presence someone relationship tension example p15 someone owed lot money believed tension anger felt towards person significant factor causing negative outcome participant talked taking psychedelic intention working relationship issue romantic partner e.g. get rough patch relationship well tripping partner feel fully comfortable afterthought relationship time feeling like fully comfortable feeling communicate experience freaking also interpersonal romantic level. p12 two participant described negative transfer caused someone else group starting struggle psychedelic p26 p28 d.2 lack social support system experience lack social support experience described potential contributing factor five participant example reported feeling able call anyone psychedelic experience became frightening participant told anyone would take psychedelic p12 another participant reported reaching therapist appeared negative bias towards drug p15 others reported encountering health care professional competence psychedelic drug related symptom e.g. hppd p25 p26 discussion present study sought identify examine long-term negative psychological response psychedelic drug long-term defined lasting longer experience psychedelic defined range classic psychedelics plus mdma used two-phase approach involving initial onboarding questionnaire designed collect quantitative descriptive data screen subsequent interview phase interview phase yielded richer qualitative data constitutes core data study main motivation study address dearth research long-term negative psychological response psychedelics sought glean insight response occur aim informing risk mitigation messaging strategy self-selective volunteering recruitment plus confirmation bias may created skew previous research finding psychedelics may inflated positive downplayed negative response may particular issue online surveying e.g. minimal control recruitment process advocate psychedelic medicine may feel inclined engage solution challenging issue create new study focused exclusively negative psychological response hoped selectively negative focus would appeal individual experienced responses—as would feel motivated share experience otherwise might feel disinclined engage even neglected difficult question prevalence due selective recruitment approach retrospective study design strongly caution drawing inference prevalence negative psychological response psychedelics present study finding population study multi-site trial e.g. meta-analyses controlled study would better suited purpose dubious case report could used opportunism over-stating prevalence harm psychedelics—as fear happened recently eighty-four questionnaire submitted present study completed full attrition rate questionnaire length average completion time min may contributed rate sixty-two percent attrition rate broadly consistent drop-out rate week post use prospective survey previously conducted young age strongest predictor drop-out questionnaire open longer month relatively brief period hoped responses—and encourage longer-recruitment period shorter onboarding questionnaire similar study carried future questionnaire shared forum dedicated certain negative response type e.g. hppd forum reddit well popular figure large audience social media—such michael pollan tim ferriss biased sampling could therefore occurred either direction i.e. psychedelics future study ideally larger sample better recording source recruitment could seek examine impact recruitment source outcome stated study doe allow inference made prevalence negative response psychedelics representative large population psychedelic user united state feel comment prevalence specific psychiatric symptom reported within small sample questionnaire completers even smaller sample individual interviewed within small sample

population prevalence specific diagnosis anxiety depression prevalent psychiatric symptom type given historic spotlighting enduring psychotic symptom hppd psychedelic-use felt particularly motivated discover case phenomenon present study recognise however behavioural cognitive disorganisation linked psychotic symptomatology may make likely individual suffering symptom would volunteer study well previous survey study —or indeed persist process interview thus left difficult scenario knowing whether case enduring psychotic symptom psychedelic-use extremely rare—as suggested —or whether method detecting case remain flawed future study could carried focus case specific symptomatology diagnosis allegedly arising psychedelic use—such psychotic type additional methodology next-of-kin and/or carer interviewing could used overcome inadvertently exclusory recruitment approaches—and gather independent perspective individual case future research might also better examine individual motivation
