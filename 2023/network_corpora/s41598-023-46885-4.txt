introduction good opportunity back reassess fundamental notion like need wastewater treatment many town trying cut cost redistribute financing public programme untreated wastewater primary source environmental degradation human sickness death across globe without managing sewage gas smell every town clean wastewater major health issue may create use unsafe water pose significant risk human health according unesco world water development report approximately 829,000 people die year diarrhoea caused water contamination sanitation hygiene practice among fatality nearly 300,000 kid age account 5.3 death age group according finding study conducted palestine resident drink directly municipal water source higher risk contracting illness diarrhoea compared consume water desalinated filtered home according finding research compared purified water tap water bottled water significant contributor gastrointestinal sickness tap water helminthiasis trachoma cholera schistosomiasis illness prevalent area insufficient access clean water sanitation service direct link polluted water spread cholera shown research conducted underdeveloped nation nevertheless cholera case may reduced treating storing water home addition disease ingesting contaminated water living unhygienic environment may cause gastrointestinal sickness preventing proper nutritional absorption leading malnutrition child susceptible severity consequence according available research occupational health concern might associated management method wastewater excreta include epilepsy skin infection parasite infection bacterial infection individual community consume fish vegetable fruit tainted contamination put risk experiencing unfavourable health impact researcher also claim due chloride risk finding suggest use treated sewerage wastewater irrigation restricted low moderate degree value residual sodium carbonate 1.25 throughout season indicates sample taken summer fall questionable use irrigation sample taken spring winter inappropriate use irrigation although may variation severity depending factor location gender age factor effect water pollution human health undeniably considerable diarrhea prevalent illness may attributed water pollution illness mostly caused enterovirus found aquatic environment continued growth industrialisation urbanisation immediate need significant work done protect water body pollution improve water quality necessary order preserve environment maintain public health order accomplish objective necessary create technology sustainable

evaluates nation based proportion total annual withdrawal compared national annual water resource hence essential country like pakistan clean wastewater reuse avoid much health economic loss unfortunately industrial sector pakistan paying much attention reuse water much concerned disease caused industrial wastewater pakistan rapidly becoming nation water shortage imperative think logically devise non-traditional method recycling water may used various reason washing clothes cleaning home process chemical physical biological nature used sewage treatment plant order purify water may used manner safe also beneficial human health stp plant also responsible treatment chemical dangerous pollutant found wastewater produced industry commercial enterprise hypothesis development environmental knowledge intention install water treatment plant environmental knowledge awareness comprehension application information pertaining environmental problem potential remedy environmental knowledge seek environmental information awareness order address environmental challenge develop solution concern addition improving awareness understanding environmental issue providing people opportunity contribute information view environmental issue facilitates making responsible decision environmental knowledge found significant factor behind adoption use product eco-friendly help improve ecosystem researcher also found student better environmental knowledge inclined toward waste management researcher also claimed knowledge contaminated water positively shape public awareness lead intention use clean water help understand environmental risk remedy minimise environmental damage suppose environmental knowledge positively influence management firm treat wastewater minimise expected environmental damage associated health risk firm management environmental knowledge positively influence intention treat wastewater install water treatment plant installation cost intention install water treatment plant installation cost refers investment/expense firm bear install plant machinery industry operation concept cost value refers investment/expense firm made install piece machinery compared expected actual benefit render firm installation researcher found positive association cost certain outcome past example positively influence intention effect study also considered

holding back new energy vehicle sector technological advancement influence spread new energy vehicle bigger effect economic subsidy policy contrary finding indicate discount initial purchase price electric vehicle one-time financial incentive consumer desire particularly case australia anticipated rather pricey conclusion sufficient literature available government incentive role firm decision instal wwtps assume affect management install contaminated wwtps government incentive influence firm management intention install water treatment plant firm reputation intention install water treatment plant term firm reputation refers consensus public opinion certain business organisation take account aspect result search engine coverage provided news activity firm made public also considered intangible asset business company reputation may described consumer opinion effectively company care customer genuinely concerned well-being client firm reputation also responsible public investment share purchase vital factor firm management concerned sustaining market every firm management conscious reputation doe action enhance reputation according finding study indonesia company environmental performance favourable noticeable impact reputation business assume firm reputation important firm survival firm management treat contaminated industrial wastewater enhance reputation therefore hypothesis following firm reputation positively influence firm management installation wwtps corporate social responsibility intention install water treatment plant corporate social

core tenet corporate social responsibility belief business work toward variety altruistic goal addition maximising profit common corporate social responsibility goal include reducing company negative impact surrounding environment encouraging worker participate community service making charitable contribution researcher found corporate social responsibility major beneficial impact firm reputation performance negative effect firm risk according finding affirm firm reputation doe fact play role mediator connection corporate social responsibility-firm performance corporate social responsibility-firm risk researcher also discovered company reputation favourably associated business performance adversely related firm risk establish significant positive correlation corporate social responsibility firm reputation literature assume csr positively influence management treat contaminated industrial wastewater improve reputation market corporate social responsibility positively influence firm management treat wastewater install wwtp firm size moderator firm size play decisive role many decision performed management financial condition employee headcount related
