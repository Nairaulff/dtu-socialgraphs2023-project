introduction fracture upper limb comprise fracture however upper limb fracture account fracture requiring inpatient care increased mortality fracture documented traditionally trauma patient requiring surgery treated inpatient busy period time operation could extend several day resulting high inpatient ward burden decreased patient satisfaction excessive pressure operating room prioritizing system developed control uneven flow patient requiring emergency surgery so-called traffic light system developed prioritize patient needing acute care optimally allocate resource urgency operation coded

significant discussion study analyzed safety controlled delay operative treatment patient upper limb fracture found mortality among upper extremity fracture patient delayed operation 2–14 day greater among rapidly implemented operation 0–48 delaying operation increase number revisits emergency department hospital readmission reason moreover inpatient time hospital ward significantly lower delayed group group decrease inpatient time expected patient whose operative treatment delayed healthier likely severe injury wait operation inpatient discharged home wait operation decision opt operative treatment taken increased mortality upper limb fracture reported study patient hospital district study using data year smr 1.5 inpatient upper limb fracture significantly increased mortality proximal humeral wrist fracture also reported elderly population fracture younger patient seem associated higher increase relative mortality fracture older patient study patient green group little younger red yellow group thus according previous finding shown higher relative mortality however case smr 0.83 0.57–1.22 green group suggesting trend toward lower mortality general population however finding statistically significant low smr green group likely result patient selection generally healthy person group admittedly proportion wrist fracture would expected influence mortality higher green group red yellow group study predict influence delay mortality showed mortality higher patient longer waiting period surgery wrist fracture surgical delay doe seem significant effect result treatment operative treatment wrist fracture delayed due secondary displacement may lead poorer functional outcome however evidence planned controlled delay without secondary displacement effect functional outcome similarly clavicle fracture statistically significant difference healing reported early delayed week fixation thus fracture seem well suited controlled delayed method surgical management knowledge study reported effect delaying surgery operative elbow fracture adult proximal humeral fracture delay day surgery associated increased loss fixation rate moreover contrary study delay day compared shorter delay treating proximal humeral fracture increased inpatient morbidity postoperative length stay however delay surgery increase risk death controlling comorbidities age many benefit patient operative treatment upper limb trauma scheduled next post-trauma day patient temporarily discharged instead waiting sometimes fasting several day inpatient wait operation busy period also allows hospital better cope trauma patient greater need acute care schedule surgery non-acute case office hour resource fully available releasing resource non-daytime activity also benefit trauma patient requiring rapid acute care e.g. hip fracture patient addition compared traditional treatment model patient directly transferred ward emergency department await surgery shorter inpatient time resulting temporally discharged patient free ward capacity noted fracture suitable delayed surgery influence delayed surgery especially respect hip fracture mortality previously studied hip fracture early surgery i.e. injury decreased late mortality compared delayed surgery upper limb fracture compromise patient mobility therefore easier patient wait home operation however patient needing extensive immobilization advanced pain management active follow vital function many preliminary comorbidities condition warranting impatient care typically admitted await surgery present study register study meaning patient assigned different urgency group based anatomic location fracture additional injury patient characteristic according current local clinical guideline instead randomization group also showed demographic difference strength study comprehensiveness hospital treating fracture patient catchment area moreover possible calculate standardized mortality ratio comparing patient finnish general population limitation study result applied population year age segment excluded analysis however obvious reason controlled delay care could also applied young population limitation register data allow analyze potential risk surgical delay functional result treatment another limitation group adjusted thus heterogeneity group characteristic induce bias result uneven patient flow limited operating room resource out-of-office hour also impact patient waiting time study shift towards conservative treatment proximal humeral fracture study period limit generalizability result moreover inclusion study multitrauma patient lenghtens mean inpatient time red yellow group effect delay surgery upper limb fracture would best established using rct however present clinical setting study unlikely two main reason first controlled delay system enables efficient trauma treatment minimal inpatient time good patient satisfaction second setting already use would difficult get real case control setting retrospective study design future research could analyze relationship delay surgery functional outcome socioeconomic impact controlled delay system also merit investigation conclusion found increase mortality among patient treated operatively controlled delay week addition length hospital stay need inpatient treatment decreased patient discharged home pending setting date operation postoperative revisits emergency department reason surgery also common patient admitted hospital urgent surgery
