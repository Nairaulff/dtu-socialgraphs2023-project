introduction world tropical sub-tropical country face high mortality morbidity associated various life-threatening vector-borne disease like malaria filariasis viral infection different specie mosquito belong genus aedes act potent vector transmitting virus like dengue chikungunya yellow fever zika etc disease burden increasing endemic area due almost geometric increase human population density rapid urbanization absence optimal surveillance program appearance resistance mosquito population commonly used chemical insecticide limited application proper vector control measure general ignorance common people adopt appropriate prophylactic measure vector control effective measure combating harmful vector-borne disease vector control approach include fumigation spraying chemical insecticide application bacterial formulation using permethrin-treated bed net introducing larvivorous fish guppy gambusia temporary permanent aquatic mosquito breeding habitat however nowadays alternative vector control strategy using biological agent fish feed immature stage mosquito larva pupa gained interest due eco-friendly nature application larva mosquito genus toxorhynchites diptera
