introduction physical activity sleep crucial physical mental health infant toddler world health organization introduced 24-hour movement guideline early year state greatest health benefit infant young child meet recommendation physical activity sedentary behavior sleep 24-h period. guideline vary based age group example 1–2-year-olds recommendation include minimum min physical activity 11–14 sleep maximum sedentary screen time min 2-year-olds min 1-year-olds 3–4-year-olds guideline recommend least min physical activity including min moderate-to-strenuous activity 10–13 sleep sedentary screen time min guideline developed response social issue observed child recent year increase obesity rate due increased sedentary behavior lack physical activity lack physical activity due obesity increased screen time child deterioration sleep quality due increased screen time concern impact lifestyle change mental physical health according flagship report united nation child fund global proportion overweight obese child age year increased 4.8 5.9 due increased calorie intake dietary change well change lifestyle behavior due rapid economic development urbanization technological advancement cheung found significant association frequency touchscreen use sleep volume reduced total duration reduced night-time sleep increased daytime sleep delayed sleep onset time taken fall asleep based

become concern study conducted shanghai china revealed child confined home approximately month due covid-19-related school closure experienced sleep disorder lack exercise excessive medium viewing lack parental care mental health problem parent harsh parenting greatly affected child mental health numerous previous study highlighted significance basic lifestyle component physical activity sleep childhood association physical mental health previous study 3–6-year-olds china used strength difficulty questionnaire sdq autism behavior scale screen time night-time sleep duration showed toddler prolonged screen time shorter sleep duration intra-sample average 9.15 significantly likely behavioral problem furthermore previous research revealed toddler current lifestyle component physical activity sleep influenced past lifestyle regarding amount physical activity strength childhood boreham ridoch noted benefit physical activity childhood include biological carryover effect adulthood

conducted study behavior child singapore using screen time data child aged 2–3 year wrist-worn accelerometer child aged 5.5 year 3–7 day finding revealed toddler total screen time age 2–3 year increased sedentary behavior age 5.5 year physical activity mild medium level compared noted toddler total screen time therefore evident child basic lifestyle component particularly physical activity sleep influence current well-being also implication future lifestyle physical mental health possibly extending adulthood however study clarified impact effect physical/mental health preschool-age

reported sleep healthy child guideline national sleep charity united kingdom center disease control prevention united state state comfortable environment important better sleep child adult guideline include example quiet comfortable bedroom active movement day removal electronic device smartphones bedroom since study suggested sleep quality early stage age year affect future sleep quality even psychosocial health improving sleep quality age year may important improving sleep quality future maintaining psychosocial health therefore support healthy physical mental growth child regarding sleep quality similar physical activity might necessary provide time guideline 10–14 per day recommended 1–4-year-olds also specific example caregiver follow improve sleep quality sleepwear room temperature setting previous study reported newborn particularly circadian rhythm fixed sleep cycle circadian rhythm nocturnal sleep pattern develop approximately 10–12 week sleep–wake pattern driven complex interaction physiological process environmental behavioral social factor individual difference hence providing specific example caregiver practicable improve quality child sleep accurate explanation necessary ensure worry excessively child crying/waking night previous study also reported association physical activity sleep gibson reported sleep timing efficiency significantly associated cognitive fine motor development child aged 11–14 month several previous study also reported association moderate amount intensity physical activity day rhythm life including sleep therefore physical activity sleep quality analyzed study may correlated study order explore association lifestyle psychosocial health aspect quantity focused physical activity sleep accordance 24-hour movement guideline early year among many lifestyle component diet often cited important factor healthy growth child addition physical activity sleep report adherence vegetable fruit intake guideline issued australian
