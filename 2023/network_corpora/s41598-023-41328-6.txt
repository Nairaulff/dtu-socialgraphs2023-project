introduction recently number sudden death case caused cardiovascular disease increasing year year growing concern previous study showed asystole presently leading reason behind death patient extra time present current key resuscitating cardiac arrest patient timely implementation cardiac resuscitation cpr occurs make reperfusion various organ patient ischemia however several study shown performing cpr patient experience cardiac arrest patient exhibit varying degree neurological deficit convulsion coma persistent vegetative state even death post-cardiac arrest syndrome pcas condition contains poor prognosis high mortality tissue hypoperfusion ischemia often occur critically ill patient important factor contributing multiple organ failure perioperative mortality patient therefore ischemia–reperfusion injury iri significant problem high incidence mortality rate associated various disease cause process involves chain reaction event includes activation apoptotic pathway inflammatory response release oxygen radical brain cell swelling overload accumulation excitatory amino acid eaa etc although currently effective treatment iri growing number study exploring use inhaled drug reduce iri study use two inert gas helium xenon treatment iri helium occasionally used ventilatory therapy patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease improving cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury xenon exhibit anesthetic property normobaric condition known fastest-acting fastest-recovering among known anesthetic also highly desirable cardiovascular characteristic making safe xenon also play certain role brain protection middle late stage cerebral ischemia–reperfusion however currently comprehensive review summarizes evaluates study therefore study aim
