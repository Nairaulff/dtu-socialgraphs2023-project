development child early childhood stimulating activity crucial fostering progress language development aspect activity rely experience training provided primary caregiver typical family parent responsible child care mother care essential nurturing child many activity mother engage raising child encourage language development reading book child singing lullaby however case skipped-generation family primary caregiver parent rather grandfather paternal maternal grandmother paternal maternal great-grandparent due financial constraint within family grandparent great-grandparents must serve child primary caregiver instead parent family willingness preparedness nurture child may differ family parent primary caregiver therefore skipped-generation family primary caregiver doe perform many activity mother may negative impact language development child addition grandparent found inappropriate response child psychoemotional need indicating primary caregiver skipped-generation family distinct parenting practice attitude compared family parent primary caregiver could potentially additional factor influence development language child regarding child sex delayed language development study shown tendency boy experience delayed language development comparison girl hence possible boy raised skipped-generation family experience delayed language development due insufficient inappropriate stimulation training language development moreover study found skipped-generation family medium including television mobile tablet employed assist caregiving non-skipped-generation
