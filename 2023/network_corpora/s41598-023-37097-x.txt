establish cross-cultural validity german chinese data date study used mgcfa methodology perform cross-cultural validation cpdi similar exploratory analysis observed individual respiratory disease mainly bronchial asthma covid-19 pandemic experienced higher psychological stress level healthy individual several study reported similar impact negative emotion covid-19 individual asthma example sheha reported high correlation anxiety depression symptom uncontrolled asthma patient covid-19 lockdown similarly boer found clinically significant increase anxiety depression among asthma patient pandemic consistent finding interestingly takeuchi reported participant respiratory disease asthma pneumonia copd experienced higher level psychological distress cardiovascular disease cancer also line result regarding anxious-depressive disorder finding suggest participant condition experience higher stress level engage rumination information-seeking behavior compared healthy individual specifically rumination coping mechanism characterized negative affect self-focused attention appears triggered repercussion consequence covid-19 pandemic rumination manifest constant search information exacerbate negative catastrophic thought leading feedback loop repetitive negative thinking thus individual anxious-depressive syndrome likely engage information-seeking behavior experience heightened level rumination due cognitive distortion associated anxiety depression also associated negative behavior seeking negative news information limitation implication research present study demonstrates spanish version cpdi consistent psychometric property peruvian spanish sample information valuable contribution research psychological stress covid-19 pandemic limitation must considered although sample size study large sample database collected using snowball method randomized time sampling furthermore participant female well-educated year old additionally participant self-reported pathology may introduce memory bias confirmed physician according table factorial structure cpdi doe form clear stable factor time resulting minimal variation among excluded question suggesting possible heterogeneity factor must considered item measuring psychological distress cpdi non-invariant shown table including rumination/seeking information factor additional limitation lack testing convergent divergent validity sample encompassed two distinct population secondary data analysis demonstrated scalar invariance mgcfa important acknowledge certain item may exhibit individual loading variation group difference could potentially attributed socioeconomic factor e.g. income level access healthcare sample-specific characteristic even response bias respondent might provide inaccurate misleading answer specific item addition higher correlation two factor found spanish peruvian population spain dealing news covid-19 strongly associated stress perception peru result could interpreted follows might possible peruvian population managed deal negative information covid-19 easily spanish population unfortunately clear statement made direction effect stress information seeking/rumination since correlative data available crucial recognize limitation study finally longitudinal data may provide stronger evidence relation two factor cpdi furthermore factorial structure cross-sectional design concerning implication future research consider applying validating cpdi instrument using efa perform cross-cultural validation using mgcfa language spanish moreover future research explore whether cpdi theoretically related scale measuring stressful experience covid-19 pandemic would provide fruitful information finally future research especially post-covid research evaluate examine psychometric aspect psychological stress using cpdi pandemic since epidemiological social condition due covid-19 changed conclusion conclusion study provides evidence cross-cultural validity cpdi reliable instrument assessing psychological stress context covid-19 across different spanish-speaking culture finding important implication developing validating measure ass psychological distress cultural context furthermore finding carry significant implication cpdi reliable culturally robust valid instrument assessing peritraumatic stress consequently regarded future study valuable tool adapted future similar event including potential future pandemic another coronavirus outbreak exploratory analysis revealed respiratory disease anxious-depressive disorder significantly increased psychological stress covid-19 pandemic latter also correlated increased rumination seeking information consistent psychopathology disorder
