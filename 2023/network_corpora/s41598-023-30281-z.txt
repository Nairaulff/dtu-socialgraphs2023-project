maximum strength abdominal muscle fiber made type fiber facilitating simultaneous contraction muscle around lumbar vertebra abdominal oblique transverse abdominis multifidus erector spine muscle may increase stability spine pelvis functional movement valuable athlete core muscle center body function stabilize trunk upper lower limb move functional movement therefore seems weak core muscle cause interruption energy transfer create abnormal movement pattern increase probability injury stable core allows efficient distal segment movement protects distal joint system work properly lead proper distribution maximum force generation minimal compressive translational shearing force joint kinetic chain well optimal control movement proper absorption shock force caused ground reaction force landing strong trunk provides stable base structure generate torque created limb according study core strengthened smaller knee valgus angle initial contact cutting task wilson reported participant greater isometric core strength demonstrated lower knee valgus angle single-leg squat finding agree observation study result show core stability training increasing core endurance decreasing knee valgus increasing knee flexion help reduce risk acl re-injury athlete aclr considering increased valgus angle decreased knee flexion associated increased risk acl injury increasing endurance core muscle decrease risk acl injury controlling lower limb kinematics also strengthening core stability muscle directly indirectly affect strength lower extremity muscle kinetic chain local control vertebra lumbopelvic control positional control interact therefore seems core stability training used study increase stability trunk pelvis increasing endurance core muscle cause pelvis extra movement stabilizes movement lower joint e.g knee due high rate acl re-injury tertiary prevention program designed applicable different place done limited amount time interfere main training sport team according result study suggested proposed training protocol used daily warm-up program athlete exercise selection effective core stability exercise performed short limited time however rcts sufficient follow-up investigate enhanced core muscle strength endurance really contribute reduced re-/injury risk reduction one limitation study lack comparison injured healthy limb athlete suggested considered future study also absence control group consisting non-injured athlete another limitation study thus study needed compare aclr athlete non-injured athlete present study performed aclr athlete hamstring tendon autograft result generalizable population addition result may vary athlete concurrent ligament injury hence recommended multiple injury study conducted finally study sufficient follow-up investigate whether increasing core muscle strength endurance really contribute reduced re-/injury risk reduction conclusion result study showed eight week simple core stability training
