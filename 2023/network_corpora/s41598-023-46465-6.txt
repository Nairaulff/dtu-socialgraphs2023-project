introduction dentistry one healthcare profession highest potential contamination patient fluid transmitting healthcare-associated infection hais reason beginning covid-19 pandemic dental practice many part world closed voluntarily government-imposed law except management emergency case exceptional precaution disinfection protocol dental clinic tightened remained widely concerning personal protecting equipment ppe surface sanitization distancing dental patient healthcare worker typically risk acquiring infectious pathogen due exchanging object material dental clinic laboratory including sars-cov-2 hiv hepatitis virus pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus sterilization heat wet dry gold standard chemical sterilization sometimes needed dental setting decontamination heat- moisture-sensitive instrument equipment withstand autoclaving chemical disinfection however technique sensitive known detrimental effect rubber- plastic-based dental instrument complete immersion hydrocolloid polyether impression disinfectant solution provides better exposure may also induce dimensional change owing imbibition hence inducing dimensional inaccuracy similarly immersion gypsum die stone disinfectant solution may induce dimensional change affect setting time reason dental impression routinely disinfected spraying without affecting dimensional accuracy however technique prone human error doe ensure reaching hidden surface undercut thereby increasing risk cross-contamination furthermore improper use chemical inadequate contact time application technique contribute incomplete disinfection spreading pathogen ultraviolet radiation ability reach surface reflecting light direction hence might better alternative disinfection dental setting furthermore ray long known efficient bactericidal property due potential cause dna damage cessation bacterial reproduction therefore radiation used alternative heat- chemical-based disinfection procedure besides international ultraviolet association reported disinfection may also prove beneficial reducing transmission covd-19 however light work surface within field view strength decrease distance moreover low dosage effectively inactivate virus spore hood device considered gold standard method disinfection microbiology laboratory however given large size cost device popular dental practice disinfection routinely carried using disinfecting solution spraying immersion recently surge public awareness importance infectioncontrol led thriving manufacturing device personal use device become available various
