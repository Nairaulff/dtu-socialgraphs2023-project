caninum intracellular obligate protozoan belongs phylum apicomplexa many host specie reported infected caninum dog related canid regarded definite host whereas hughesi found equine definitive host yet identified transmission neospora spp occurred either vertically horizontally according brazilian study transplacental transmission neospora occurs 34.8 borned foal seropositive mare showed anti- neospora pre-colostral antibody despite transplacental transmission neospora spp equine role neospora transplacental transmission route equine abortion still fully understood equine reproductive disorder neonatal mortality associated caninum infection hughesi cause neurological affection nonetheless neospora infection intermediate host typically undetected absence symptom exposure determined existence anti- neospora antibody popular technique determining distribution epidemiology neosporosis susceptible animal detection antibody neospora spp serum sample however serological discrimination two specie likely attainable possibility cross-reaction caninum hughesi serological testing complicates interpretation serological survey result numerous country reported neospora spp serologically equine neospora antibody found equine serum sample south korea 11.5 sample north america 2.5 sample south america 23.8 sample new zealand sample france serological study horse israel seroprevalence

throughput screening antibody parasite egypt prevalence associated risk factor neospora infection studied domestic ruminant prevalence rate ranged 8.6 36.1 sheep 10.9 camel 20.43–24.6 dairy cattle however lack epidemiological information disease equine therefore goal study determine seroprevalence neospora spp equine identify associated risk factor neospora infection equine three egyptian governorates material method study area study conducted equine raising three governorates namely giza kafr elsheikh qalyubia situated north egypt selected governorates distinguished high equine

parasite disease affect domestic animal pose risk public health addition inflicting severe economic loss neospora spp infection either subclinical clinical form reported horse numerous country across world egypt many animal specie including cattle sheep goat camel found infected neospora however knowledge earlier research identified infection neospora spp equine egypt therefore present study aim investigate presence antibody neospora spp equine three egyptian governorates improve epidemiology disease area determine risk factor infection pose overall finding current study show equine egypt antibody neospora spp. consistent stated rate horse czech republic comparison prevalence rate disease among horse earlier study seropositive rate neospora infection horse detected current study relatively high comparison study brazil prevalence rate 2.5 examined horse ten different brazilian state according hoane 10.3 among horse state paulo 4.1 horse two area santa catarina state hand report country indicate higher prevalence rate prevalence reported among chilean horse patitucci horse various age italy ciaramella reported prevalence contrast animal costa rica found prevalence rate

found high among donkey iran using agglutination test pakistan 32.6 based elisa china 9.5 italy 11.8 using celisa according previous literature clear prevalence neospora spp equine varied significantly even within country variance may result use different serological test study testing methodology limitation non-standard control applied cut-off point moreover neospora spp seroprevalences may influenced study design sample collection criterion varying amount exposure various risk protective factor infection sickness make challenging compare finding diverse study neospora spp seroprevalence varied significantly age group highest seroprevalence observed among equine 12–24 month age according current study finding come agreement earlier study israel reported significant greater seroprevalence neospora spp older horse due increased arisk exposure via horizontal spreading time addition neospora spp seroprevalence increased non-significantly 22.2 27.2 age group 1–10 11–20 year old respectively turkish study contrary finding bártová observed significant difference equine age group prevalence rose equine age ranging 15.4 foal 26.6 yearling indicating postnatal transmission line previous result villalobos talafha significant difference 0.05 sex current finding revealed higher prevalence female attributed female may susceptible neospora spp infection due worse immune response different time life aresult stress pregnancy lacation cause immunosuppression increase vulnerability infection concerning feeding type examined equid present result consistent previous finding nazir neospora spp seroprevalence increased significantly among grazing animal could explained horizontal transmission neospora spp among equid considered main rout transmission increase risk infection equid current finding revealed natural breeding increased risk infection equine compared consistent finding araújo valença explain vertical transimission play vital role transmission neospora spp equine comparison female equine without history abortion prevalence neospora spp significantly 0.05 greater female history abortion however evidence rather scant compared cattle caninum consistently shown major cause abortion neospora specie may play role equine abortion result consistent research population mare reproductive problem high percentage anti- neospora spp antibody result demonstrated equine contacted dog high signifcant prevalence rate neospora spp comapred animal result consistent reported araújo valença existence seropositive dog around investigated equid may indicate animal exposed parasite increasing risk oocyst contamination food water subsequent horizontal transmission current study limitation include bias sample collection possible representation examined governorates equine population diagnostic approach since identify neospora spp however unable determine specie neospora result research required large-scale screening determining neospora specie egyptian equine conclusion first instance neospora spp found egyptian equine several risk factor associated neospora spp infection like age specie management type breeding history abortion contact dog finding demonstrate neospora spp contributing factor abortion egyptian mare thus prevention control program implemented prevent spreading disease among equine economic loss result abortion additional epidemiological research molecular detection parasite dna tissue placenta aborted fetus identify neospora spp necessary
