introduction current guideline recommend advanced life support established ultrasound used detect potentially reversible cause cardiac arrest prehospital setting non-invasive technique transthoracic echocardiography normally used given small portable ultrasound system available technique readily accessed scene emergency despite suggestion transthoracic echocardiography may feasible prehospital setting may usually offer adequate image quality cardiac arrest limited ultrasound window carry risk major quality issue also time available perform transthoracic ultrasound examination limited short moment chest compression paused rhythm check transthoracic echocardiography also suspected increase hands-off time cardiopulmonary resuscitation transesophageal echocardiography tee potential overcome issue interfering cardiopulmonary resuscitation allowing continuous visualization heart even hands-on time normally offering quality imaging superior transthoracic ultrasound addition tee shown highly sensitive detecting reversible cause cardiac arrest may improve chest compression identifying optimal surface position application several study report available use tee guide cardiopulmonary
