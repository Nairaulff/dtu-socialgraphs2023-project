maintenance valli pesca lose capacity flow provisioning also lose landscape characteristic regulating rely resulting lower contribution entire lagoon light consideration must consider challenging unceasing anthropic intervention aimed conserving best condition valli pesca require high intellectual financial effort pose long-standing dilemma within venice lagoon regarding legitimacy valli pesca remaining private management area let public management ensure free fair public access may risk losing vital lagoon habitat consequently regulating provisioning hand allowing private people maintain aquaculture hunting purpose mean ensuring conservation regulating maintenance along trade-off restricted access regime economic advantage benefit people nonetheless work suggests probably valli pesca private management maintained natural ecological process along landscape feature make capable providing regulating maintenance therefore paradox arises considering venice lagoon ecosystem strongly need human intervention mainly privately funded conserve natural environment important habitat moreover forecast ruling venice lagoon using mobile barrier face climate change effect great attention paid hydrodynamic change resulting mose barrier functioning since artificially managed ecosystem valli pesca exchange matter energy main water body lagoon could affected reduced tidal energy lowered quality waterfront conclusion highlight management strategy affect valli pesca also venice lagoon governance doe thus suggest decision-makers seek ecosystem-based management approach considers part
