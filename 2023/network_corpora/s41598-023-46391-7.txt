pregnancy physiological factor increase plasma estrogen concentration might contributed decrease total blood mercury level late pregnancy lower early pregnancy previous study shown trend decrease blood mercury level late pregnancy due diluting effect increased plasma volume several study examined effect heavy metal exposure newborn anthropometrics among cadmium found profound impact several birth outcome although birth outcome showed correlation lead mercury concentration population since heavy metal cause physiological immaturity pregnancy early life pose serious threat fetal infant health effect cadmium apoptosis oxidative stress reactive oxygen specie deoxyribonucleic acid dna repair attributed toxicity cadmium may also affect growth fetus affecting 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type activity pregnancy exposure cadmium linked decreased birth weight premature birth elevated level placental cadmium resulting maternal exposure industrial waste tobacco smoke associated decreased progesterone biosynthesis placental trophoblast also number potential mechanism contribute cadmium-induced fetal growth restriction fgr including hypoxia fetus disturbed fetoplacental zinc homeostasis reduced blood flow uterus placenta previous study shown link prenatal cadmium exposure low birth weight total mother-infant pair hubei province china provided evidence positive association maternal cadmium exposure risk infant preterm low birth weight plbw earlier cross-sectional study pregnant woman eastern china observed maternal blood cadmium level inversely related birth weight 0.22 0.03 another study pregnant woman united state reported high maternal blood cadmium level 0.50 μg/l negatively associated birth weight percentile gestational age positively associated sga 1.71 1.10 2.64 consistent result finding also indicated high maternal blood cadmium level early pregnancy 0.62 μg/l late pregnancy 0.70 μg/l inversely associated birth weight whereas showed association sga analysis demonstrated cord blood lead level positively associated birth weight although observed statistically significant positive association could due impact factor maternal nutrition may influence birth weight nutritional intake considered study although could impact low birth weight therefore could completely exclude influence dietary intake metal exposure measurement one previous study also detected positive association birth weight nickel likewise another study reported non-significant positive association cadmium level birth weight maternal blood 87.0 63.1–237.0 cord blood 55.0 108.2–218.3 however previous study showed significant inverse association lead birth weight association study several strength first study prospective korean birth cohort design extensive information potential confounders main strength study large sample size moreover heavy metal estimated two time point early pregnancy late pregnancy provide accurate association heavy metal level outcome however study also limitation first study focused three major heavy metal presence toxic heavy metal might affected main result example one study showed selenium level associated newborn birth weight increased selenium intake might decrease cord blood cadmium concentration however majority previous study including demonstrated cadmium linked lower birth weight second genetic information could correlated birth outcome included present study conclusion result suggest low level prenatal exposure cadmium lead mercury might affect birth outcome study provides support need reduce cadmium exposure among pregnant woman much possible although effect heavy metal exposure birth outcome might small consequence might negligible study effect prenatal exposure variety metal present environment birth outcome needed
