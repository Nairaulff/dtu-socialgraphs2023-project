closure school non-essential business activity banning public gathering closing country border countrywide lockdown focusing preventing spread virus policy measure aimed lower pandemic burden prevent healthcare system collapse protecting individual physical health physical health definitely precarious basic need however consequence life domain protecting precarious need enormous covid-19 crisis indeed heightened risk factor generally associated poor mental health e.g financial insecurity unemployment fear protective factor e.g social connection daily routine employment educational engagement access physical exercise health service fell dramatically early evidence beginning covid-19 pandemic indeed show lockdown measure put citizen especially vulnerable group risk developing several mental health problem depression anxiety several characteristic individual particularly vulnerable mental health problem lower well-being lockdown identified include loss income decreased access basic supply

well-being time repeated cross-sectional representative sample belgian population furthermore explored differential change well-being pandemic episode different age group using moderation analysis lastly building several multiple linear regression model aimed shed light factor contributing subjective well-being pandemic episode overall result show well-being belgian population decreased covid-19 pandemic however well-being indicator recovered average approximately pre-pandemic level restriction lifted evaluative component swb found significant decline life evaluation second lockdown fifth wave decline could caused severe policy measure time previous research european country indeed suggested policy stringency negatively affect life satisfaction lockdown policy measure carefully considered thus contrary finding recent review study show life evaluation belgian population remain stable pandemic regard affective component swb individual living belgium reported positive emotion second lockdown fifth wave review aknin also showed positive emotion declined first year pandemic finding illustrate decline continued longer pandemic lasted next regard negative affect found difference time indicating belgian population experienced negative emotion extent pandemic finding surprising previous research repeatedly reported increased distress anxiety depression covid-19 pandemic however could diminished positive emotion pose greater risk depression one key characteristic depression anhedonia i.e lack pleasure also significant change basic psychological need autonomy competence relatedness found covid-19 pandemic autonomy sense psychological freedom declined significantly finding surprising since people life restricted failure comply covid-related policy measure punishable competence sense effectiveness mastery significantly lower relatedness sense connection important others fluctuated pandemic aftermath overall positive trend noted thus lockdown measure forcefully decrease number social interaction people seem tend invest time energy interaction matter decline quantity social interaction appears led increase quality furthermore social cohesion solidarity spark light disaster pandemic notwithstanding increase relatedness loneliness increased significantly remained elevated result thus contradict aknin found loneliness remained largely stable first year pandemic however study regarding loneliness included review covered first month pandemic plausible people experience lockdown differently longer last gradually become lonely longer confined result suggest also investigated pandemic-related change peace mind important determinant mental general well-being particularly second lockdown experienced peace mind significantly lower peace mind refers emotional state consists component peacefulness low-arousal positive affect serenity harmony process self-control individual use suppress intense feeling evident peace mind declined time hope quick return normal life replaced increasing uncertainty also broaden-and-build theory may help shed light decline subsequent recovery peace mind theory state positive emotion bolster people strategy deal negativity however pandemic adult living belgium experienced fewer positive emotion according result hence ability suppress intense feeling weakened peace mind diminished experience positive emotion increased simultaneous upward trend peace mind observed furthermore examined differential change well-being pandemic period various age group line previous finding result indicate well-being younger individual suffered pandemic period lockdown measure particular result suggest individual age resilient downward trend well-being related pandemic period delayed group several well-being indicator life evaluation positive affect negative affect autonomy loneliness peace mind line previous study showing older adult experienced negative effect pandemic psychological well-being stress resilience could related adaptive coping mechanism group compared younger individual result also show compared older adult younger individual experience peace mind appears important predictor swb component however research mechanism explaining age difference pandemic-related change well-being warranted finding younger individual experienced worse change well-being covid-19 pandemic period could also indicate general trend declining well-being younger generation instance recent study conducted germany shown increase depressive symptom younger generation according result downward trend might magnified covid-19 pandemic period research factor protecting well-being potential harmful factor thus warranted younger individual well across lifespan lastly investigated role several explanatory variables—autonomy competence relatedness loneliness peace mind—in predicting subjective well-being pandemic result show especially peace mind strongly related component swb finding line previous research indicating peace mind important determinant mental psychological well-being regard affective component subjective well-being competence sense mastery efficacy strong contributing factor practical implication recommendation recommendation support research long-term consequence pandemic well-being mean restrengthen well-being nation result clearly illustrate negative trend general well-being belgian population related covid-19 pandemic policy measure fortunately well-being largely recovered restriction lifted showing resilience nation finding remarkable light current crisis europe facing i.e rising energy price inflation war ukraine illustrates importance social connection nation well-being previous research indeed shown social connection crucial ingredient subjective well-being also research shown pandemic social support positive effect peace mind strong predictor swb well-being component according finding pandemic-related change well-being may small magnitude found cohen range 0.10 0.30 underestimated therefore previously recommended aknin call research long-term consequence pandemic general well-being nation future research also explore restrengthen mental subjective well-being furthermore urge government act upon research actively invest support well-being nation recommendation invest accessible mental health care service crisis like covid-19 pandemic reveals weakness system access adequate mental health care service one weakness study rens highlighted issue unmet mental health need general population belgium moreover nearly half patient belgium wait one month first contact child adolescent issue even worse waiting time long six month longer private sector crisis care thus clear mentally ill individual equal access evidence-based treatment physically ill therefore urge government invest accessibility mental health care service aftermath pandemic belgium government instance recently increased budget reimbursement primary psychological care although good starting point measure may sufficient new convention adult reimbursed individual session group session case amount insufficient enable durable change addition reimbursing fixed number session indirectly communicated patient cured time might become demotivated notable change take longer recommendation policy measure consider aspect health public health concerned preventing disease prolonging life promoting health organized societal effort recognizes health encompasses physical aspect also underline importance mental social well-being definition health nevertheless policy measure covid-19 pandemic mainly focused securing physical health preventing healthcare system collapse thereby paying attention impact pandemic aspect health yet number people whose mental health affected epidemic might outweigh number people affected infection according health glance report instance number young people reporting depressive symptom doubled covid-19 crisis several country also result showed overall well-being nation declined pandemic therefore strongly recommend policymakers consider aspect health installing measure tackle future pandemic policymakers furthermore advised timely adapt strategy people longer confined absolutely necessary recommendation policymakers attentive mental health need younger member nation especially pandemic result indicate younger individual susceptible negative change well-being pandemic period also mental health problem prevalent younger adult implementing measure policymakers thus advised protect well-being younger member nation much possible great importance prevent mental health problem given great burden individual also society addition strengthening resilience mental well-being younger group key importance ideally start early indeed mental health childhood adolescence predicts mental health adulthood therefore government enable well-being promotion early including positive psychology education school indeed valuable setting implement positive psychology intervention targeting well-being child adolescent strength limitation better understand context finding strength weakness mentioned first strength study notably large representative sample belgian population five timepoints second strength many variable concept potentially related swb questioned allowing better understand pandemic-related change well-being broad sense third first measurement point right start pandemic belgium result study contribute new evidence consequence pandemic period associated policy measure investigating long-term change well-being belgian population pandemic episode fourth based result able formulate valuable policy recommendation clear call future research study also limitation first investigate long-term pandemic-related change well-being study used repeated cross-sectional survey instead golden standard longitudinal research nevertheless result based large representative

belgian population fact lower reported study analysis association however appear affected sampling bias addition study may suffered form sampling bias online questionnaire used people access familiar internet could participate also people recruited via research consulting company data non-response notwithstanding fact sample bias might occurred study sample various timepoints representative belgian population weighted based several sociodemographic characteristic age gender educational level occupational status region third although certainly major strength many concept questioned approach resulted necessity shorten slightly adapt measurement order limit time fill questionnaire avoid response bias result peace mind longer assessed using strictly validated measurement lee nonetheless cronbach alpha still sufficient also dutch french version available literature translate using forward back translation method lastly used self-report questionnaire induce social desirability bias however social desirability bias remained limited questionnaire strictly anonymous nevertheless future research could benefit using additional measurement method obtain information swb well-being indicator conclusion well-being belgian population decreased covid-19 pandemic especially second fifth wave restriction lifted well-being indicator recovered approximately pre-pandemic
