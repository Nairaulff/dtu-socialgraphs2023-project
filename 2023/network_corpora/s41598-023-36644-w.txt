introduction year emergence severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 variant omicron become global concern omicron variant carry variety mutation enhance infectious immune escape capacity making dominant strain many country around world pose new challenge prevention control coronavirus disease covid-19 compared early original strain omicron variant mutated strain among many sars-cov-2 variant arising covid-19 pandemic common clinical manifestation fever cough myalgia fatigue stuffy runny nose nausea diarrhea loss taste smell sars-cov-2 invades respiratory system also cause organ injury severe case cardiovascular disease overall high prevalence poor outcome furthermore patient known cardiovascular disease increased risk developing severe form covid-19 therefore increasing attention paid cardiovascular adverse event caused viral infection detection evaluation myocardial injury extremely important clinical practice troponin elevation often used standard judge myocardial injury however rare utilize imaging tool evaluate cardiac function histological characteristic myocardial injury patient infected omicron often cause lung disease chest computed tomography necessary evaluate lung disease soft tissue resolution relatively high measurement myocardial value may play certain auxiliary role judgment myocardial injury evaluating lung lesion purpose present
