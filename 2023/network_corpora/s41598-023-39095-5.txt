introduction initially birdsong defined long complex vocalization produced male breeding season defend territory attract female state knowledge result large disproportion bioacoustics study conducted mostly temperate rarely tropical region indeed temperate region predominantly male sing peak vocal activity observed beginning short breeding season—when male establish territory attract female many specie singing activity decrease stage incubation parental care chick increase next brood female fertile daily context bird specie sing intensively around sunrise dawn chorus sunset dusk chorus however song various singing intensity produced whole day well night specie contrast temperate region many tropical bird specie sedentary defend territory year-round breed different time year depending food availability weather condition therefore presence singing throughout whole year expected seasonal peak vocal activity good indicator reproductive activity unfortunately study analysing year-round change vocal activity rare even though may help fully understand biology ecology behaviour bird well improve monitoring method using autonomous sound recorder enable sampling soundscape whole year may help fill knowledge gap especially region habitat difficult access part year overview birdsong global scale reveals female song quite widespread especially tropic observed songbird specie female song appears ancestral state rare song performance female temperate specie may effect rapid loss female singing ability however understanding evolution function female song need study examining phenomenon biologically ecologically diverse specie well outside breeding season concentrating breeding season may lead misleading conclusion even overlooking female song example european robin erithacus rubecula female sing defend wintering territory whereas remain silent breeding season alpine accentor prunella collaris female sing fertile period attract mate signalling quality receptivity mating many bird specie male female sing collectively coordinated way creating duet duet observed bird specie show great variation duetting specie male female may sing cooperative song antiphonal simultaneous manner various level coordination phrase produced male female may simple complex sex-specific indistinguishable sex depending specie duet may initiated male female sex various proportion proportion duet solo may vary considerably well within specie evolution duet strongly associated coordinated year-round defence ecological resource male female demand availability resource seasonally variable therefore may expect sex-specific seasonally variable motivation defence resource also reflected yearly change singing activity male female however study duet function focused breeding pre-breeding season examined collective singing year-round context e.g suggesting seasonally-variable specie specific duetting behaviour therefore know lot often context bird use duet outside

male song part attraction process signalling interest pairing lack solo song also excludes intersex territory defence female use song defend resource female duet observed year-round suggest function cooperative singing could joint resource defence however yet know whether sex participate territory defence whether jointly study using playback experiment needed support hypothesis observed singing behaviour female sing duet suggests main function female song bangwa forest warbler could mate guarding signalling commitment defence resource answering partner song female advertise mated status partner way female may prevent partner usurped maintain monogamy minimising chance extra-pair copulation male take additional female hypothesis also supported seasonal pattern female singing activity—females sing intensive march august male also highly vocally active show peak seasonal vocal activity month male signalling commitment especially important sedentary specie long-term partnership reproductive success depends effort partner therefore bangwa forest warbler female responding male solo song year round may signalling willingness put effort territory defence aspect partnership also elicit ongoing investment partner sedentary socially monogamous duetting bird specie long-term pair bond level extrapair paternity high therefore mechanism reducing extrapair paternity expected however study needed confirm indicate form mate guarding signalling commitment defence another resource observed bangwa forest warbler done steere liocichla liocichla steerii nevertheless fact female song produced consistently low rate throughout year may suggest female song similar function throughout year loss resource including mate equally likely equally detrimental throughout year song serf multiple function exclusively tied breeding many duetting specie highest rate duet observed first hour day study found similar pattern since male female sang intensively first hour sunrise however bangwa forest warbler male sang dawn dry wet season female singing rate morning chorus seasonally stable moreover unlike male female sang consistent rate whole day show distinguishable second daily peak vocal activity dusk several explanation dawn chorus still best-supported hypothesis propose singing morning relatively low energetic cost optimal manipulating female mating settle territory boundary may promote handicap mechanism prevents dishonest signalling intensive year round singing female morning also support hypothesis main function female song could mate guarding however observed inter-territory difference proportion duet suggesting female may variously motivated guard mate hand relatively constant rate female song throughout whole day suggests function related defence resource mate also highly probable female bangwa forest warbler followed male general seasonal singing activity pattern however observed constantly high vocal activity march august observed male assuming main function female song study specie mate guarding and/or signalling commitment may expect first peak vocal activity female observed exactly month like male may related
