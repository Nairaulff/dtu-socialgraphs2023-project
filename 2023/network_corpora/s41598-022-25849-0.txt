significantly decreased increasing volume fluid intake well total water intake result consistent previous suggestion multiple factor e.g fluid intake diet exercise ambient temperature time previous voiding influence urine hydration status index therefore noted post-work hydration status likely reflect acute change hydration status current hydration status accurate assessment hydration status

previous observation increase body mass total body water observed work result may suggest forester adjust amount fluid intake current need drank much fluid also line recommendation according amount fluid consumed cause significant increase body weight follows worker create hydration plan total water intake many study effect various environmental condition water balance although water balance summer winter similar water intake water loss higher summer due intense sweating caused high temperature heat stress also observed work environmental temperature impact hydration status risk dehydration 9.305 time higher work environmental temperature wbgt welt bulb globe temperature wbgt therefore amount water consumed fluid may vary season year finding show forester consumed water fluid

rather prescribe volume amount fluid consume work depending season present study minimum amount fluid consumed forester summer autumn winter maximum amount fluid consumed forester summer autumn winter present study result consistent previous pilot study also showed difference worker amount fluid consumed work summer winter previous study summer amount fluid drank forester ranged winter similarly bates observed difference amount fluid consumed among logger min maximum first five hour work biggs also reported difference volume fluid intake forestry worker consume fluid shift study forester drank fluid work although amount varied large variation intake fluid among forester likely reflects variation individual fluid requirement also worth emphasizing reaching recommended level water

consumption meal break 31,000 total fluid intake lower intake water meal break may due libitum access cold water also cordial flavouring job well worker well educated regarding amount frequency drinking worth noting meal meal break may significantly affect amount fluid intake properly hydrated worker meal may important source mineral e.g lost sweat however participant dehydrated lower total water intake unlikely compensate water need water food type fluid study focused drinking preference worker topic hold significant implication productivity wellbeing health water coffee tea emerged top beverage choice confirming finding previous study guelinckx seasonal change influence drinking habit worker consumed tea winter summer possibly due need warmth colder temperature aligns recommendation worker consume chilled beverage hotter climate warm drink cooler climate however finding contextualized within individual preference external factor climate work condition line present study influence

coffee tea cola soft drink sport drink study agricultural worker oregon washington observed versus worker consumed soda versus sport drink versus juice respectively concerningly observed around one-third forestry worker consumed fruit/vegetable juice sweetened carbonated drink summer high sugar beverage consumption detrimental health effect educational programme proper workplace hydration needed although fruit juice may seen healthy choice contain vitamin mineral also high natural sugar research health effect different type juice requires study currently recommended limit drinking juice cup per day turn sweetened beverage high content added sugar result high daily energy intake among member state people belgium around malta germany hungary poland bulgaria reported drinking sugar-sweetened soft drink least day moreover average 6.5 u.s. adult total daily calorie come sugar-sweetened beverage mean recommended daily intake free sugar added sugar plus sugar naturally present honey syrup fruit juice total energy intake may exceeded consuming sweetened carbonated beverage alone however advice avoid specific drink e.g. containing caffeine could inadvertently result lower total fluid intake especially beverage liked worker part normal diet .therefore worker certain autonomy regarding type fluid consumed knowing impact different drink health allow choose health-promoting drink change hydration status work versus work observed uae construction worker arrived work euhydrated maintained status 12-h shift underground miner optimal hydration work remained hydrated work pre-shift post shift hydration status critical concern worker study forestry worker properly hydrated work maintained state afterwards turn worker dehydrated shift 2.6 time likely poorly hydrated shift compared arrived work good hydration nurse doctor dehydrated end shift mean volume fluid intake approximately euhydrated worker end shift moreover worker euhydrated work dehydrated work worker dehydrated work drank present study forester worker dehydrated work consumed fluid work worker dehydrated work statistically significant appears inadequate fluid intake restricted break time lack awareness hydration may contribute dehydration work limitation study limitation sample size small consisted solely male forester might limit generalizability result however research strength lie focus single-gender population performing occupation across different season limiting confounding variable finding contribute understanding worker hydration behaviour inform intervention promote healthier drinking habit improve worker well-being conclusion conclusion study underscore significant influence fluid intake hydration status worker specifically forester notably laboratory assessment post-work hydration may exactly mirror overall hydration status may rather indicate acute change fluid intake importantly quantity water consumed worker doe necessarily align individual hydration need finding also reveal impact seasonal change type beverage worker choose underscoring necessity appropriate education fluid consumption workplace insight mind worker consider following guideline water
