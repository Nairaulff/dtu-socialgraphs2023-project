informational normative influence conclusion according theory implementing new law policy may directly channel people perform desired behavior also promote desired behavior shaping norm society combining state-level policy data panel survey study found policy designed promote vaccination positively correlated social norm vaccination intention better establish causal effect conducted four preregistered experiment one nationally representative sample examining impact policy recommending healthy child vaccinate covid-19 increasing decreasing funding immunization program four experimental study presence vaccine-supportive policy increased intention receive vaccine promoting social norm supportive vaccination mediating role norm impact policy behavior greater direct effect policy even though direct effect represents standard mechanism underlies use policy influence behavior two mechanism i.e. informational normative used understand policy shape behavior shaping norm study demonstrated policy exerted informational normative influence promote vaccination outcome clear much result might generalize policy vaccine study focused policy ease behavior without necessarily rewarding recommending vaccination increasing vaccination funding police pair negative behavior punishment e.g. restricting one ability work travel one chooses vaccinate may similar effect norm due potential psychological reactance however recent study found social distancing measure introduced pandemic stronger impact social norm government announcement danger social interaction likewise possible effect policy might effective established vaccine mmr people might already formed strong attitude vaccine thus vaccination decision would susceptible policy effect another potential limitation study use hypothetical scenario investigate causal impact policy norm one could test hypothesis study using different method example future research may use natural experiment examine role vaccination policy respect reassuring main result line recent study health topic using different methodology data despite caveat finding inform public policy showing addition implementing policy favor
