introduction cataract blindness affect twenty million people worldwide primarily low- middle-income country blindness reversible successful cataract surgery manual small incision cataract surgery msics low-cost low-technology cataract surgery technique found outcome comparable expensive high-technology technique phacoemulsification however shortage eye surgeon globally led backlog patient need cataract surgery additionally training new surgeon challenging due increased risk complication cataract surgery performed trainee simulation-based training sbt shown improve operating room performance surgeon resulting better patient outcome previous research focused use simulator phacoemulsification cataract surgery use sbt training msics could also beneficial approach may effective way train surgeon msics non-profit humanitarian organization called helpmesee developed virtual reality simulator haptic feedback train surgeon safe performance msics aim helpmesee increase number msics surgeon

clarify exactly measured specified simulator task also combining simulator metric expert raters might helpful especially final assessment interestingly none experienced phacoemulsification cataract surgeon experienced msics surgeon passed test despite similarity step msics phacoemulsification finding suggests experience performing phacoemulsification doe necessarily translate proficiency msics agrees previous study shown microsurgical motor learning highly task specific thomsen study compared performance ophthalmology resident received training cataract surgery found significant difference ability perform vitreoretinal procedure eyesi simulator would unlikely cataract surgeon begin performing vitreoretinal surgery without first obtaining additional fellowship training would much likely phacoemulsification surgeon might start performing msics without additional formal training therefore may underestimate additional knowledge skill required learn msics intuitive ocular surgical skill one procedure necessarily transfer another ocular procedure strength study design use standardized method collecting data standardized method allowed collecting data internationally multiple center ensured step msics procedure included development test capture complexity procedure study limitation one limitation small number participant common medical education research another limitation simulator associated metric designed ass performance based technique used helpmesee msics standard procedure many experienced msics surgeon may use technique differ helpmesee standard procedure thus
