introduction abortion livestock production health problem causing significant economic loss worldwide would great importance public health prompted microorganism cause human disease livestock production loss associated abortion marked negative impact poorest community depend livestock livelihood food security health social well-being cause abortion multifactorial range infectious non-infectious factor infectious factor including bacteria fungi protozoan virus contribute abortion among infectious agent bacteria brucella spp. coxiella burnetii leptospira spp. listeria monocytogenes play significant role inducing abortion ruminant also zoonotic non-infectious cause include nutritional genetic/chromosomal/metabolic physical stress housing condition transport brucellosis caused bacteria genus brucella among zoonotic brucella abortus brucella melitensis infect cattle small ruminant respectively coxiella burnetii zoonotic pathogen classified genus coxiella cause query fever fever affect many animal specie including cattle sheep goat member genus listeria cause listeriosis listeria monocytogenes pathogenic several animal specie listeria ivanovi pathogenic ruminant mainly sheep member genus leptospira cause leptospirosis zoonotic specie leptospira interrogans leptospira borgpetersenii primarily responsible infection ruminant identifying
