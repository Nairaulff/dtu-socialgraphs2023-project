introduction intensification agricultural production including planted forest fruit plantation significantly expanded various region last century resulting significant change landscape composition consequent simplification biological complexity simplified productive landscape usually associated higher pest pressure lower level control natural enemy several crop however pest response landscape complexity show variable pattern globally primarily related specie trait specific context crop cultivated furthermore forestry system much studied understanding different key driver modulate
