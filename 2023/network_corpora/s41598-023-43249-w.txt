transformed structure condition healthcare considerably several medical department either closed designated covid care facility resulting significant number clinician provide care covid patient regard surgical care non-emergency procedure elective cholecystectomy immediately suspended compliance lockdown measure considering circumstance surprising number patient increased substantially period since patient gallstone treated acute inflammation also present elective cholecystectomy suspended irish study reported similar finding number case even supposed possible reason excessive consumption fatty food based stay-at-home principle study examining elective cholecystectomy united kingdom showed pre-pandemic group higher proportion operation performed non-inflammatory pathology compared post-covid recovery phase notable contrast observed period median age patient receiving care significantly lower compared previous period younger patient usually undergone surgery milder symptom acute inflammatory event period required care pandemic covid healthcare capacity dropped every level healthcare provision system general practitioner tertiary centre focussing covid patient frequently sought medical attention accessed suitable healthcare provider experiencing symptom several day reaching advanced stage inflammation well indicated significant change rate morphological diagnosis made based ultrasound scan period rate rose considerably compared period clearly due late treatment lack elective management study conducted german tertiary centre yielded similar result though elevated

significantly lower rate significant change surgery rate systematic review yielded comparable finding however study reported ptgbd rate higher covid period also higher rate conservative therapy decrease rate surgical treatment recent article july found similar result examining data academic center comparing 15–15 month pre-pandemic pandemic period priority given drainage indicates advanced case grade iii high cci bad general condition patient surgery longer first-line option conservative therapy alone longer sufficient therefore drainage best option italian study clearly recommends ptgbd primary therapy covid-positive patient even non-covid patient conservative therapy failed fit surgery however analysing data pre-covid period first two covid wave british study found difference

case laparoscopic cholecystectomy safely used pandemic also demonstrated large number cohort median length hospital stay exhibit significant difference implementation minimal doctor-patient contact reduced capacity covid pandemic might accounted 1-day earlier discharge patient period high rate unexpected readmission period may caused higher rate addition 1-day shorter hospital stay due limited number case mortality data doe allow conclusive inference made larger study therefore needed conclusion data suggests imposing restriction elective cholecystectomy lead increased occurrence acute cholecystitis younger patient fewer underlying condition however patient may experience higher frequency perforation readmission result ptgbd may emerge significant treatment option alongside acute cholecystectomy managing comprehensive manner particularly conservative therapy successful
