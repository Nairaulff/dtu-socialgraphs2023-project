introduction frontal functional asymmetry proposed potential target neurofeedback nfb training mental disorder nfb study used electroencephalography eeg investigation nfb functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri rather limited study aimed identifying functional asymmetry effect fmri exploring potential target fmri nfb study address pathological process symptom associated process last decade real-time fmri rtfmri nfb emerged sophisticated methodology target spatially precise cortical signal clinical application explored extensively one main challenge development rtfmri nfb approach identification suitable target brain process one potential target process proposed utility nfb training based association emotional motivational process frontal asymmetry two hemisphere brain common concept understanding function human brain also almost ubiquitous lay theory two hemisphere brain similar size weight asymmetry evident anatomical i.e size surface area cortical thickness functional domain frontal functional asymmetry regarded trait measure relatively stable across time well state-dependent response environmental stimulus trait mostly examined rest reflects intra-individual difference related psychological trait depression anxiety anger behavioral activation modulate state response emotional stimulus state usually measured emotionally evocative task example emotionally evocative film clip anger elicitation task insult stimulus task reward punishment incentive task proposed may interaction emotional salience emotion predisposition thus emotional task may reveal better rest state concept relevant nfb training want reduce trait might vulnerability factor mental disorder target trait want train people modulate emotional state target state frontal asymmetry intensively studied relationship emotion motivation personality psychopathological construct e.g according approach-withdrawal motivational/emotional model left-sided frontal activity assumed related approach system elicits positive emotion approach-related motivation goal-directed behavior right-sided frontal activity assumed associated withdrawal system elicits negative affect withdrawal-related motivation behavior based model greater right side frontal activity proposed risk factor development affective disorder used target nfb example depression several study suggested modulating functional asymmetry nfb reduce depressive symptom e.g notably nfb study used eeg technique mri study investigated frontal structural asymmetry trait explored association mental disorder investigation fmri application rtfmri nfb rather limited existing fmri study supported approach-withdrawal model e.g research explored fmri affective disorder example herrington found depressed patient healthy
