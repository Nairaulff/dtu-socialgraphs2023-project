introduction broad consensus future healthcare require intensive use information technology acquire store process analyse use information extracted medical data anaesthesia critical care speciality technical data-driven medical environment development new approach integration use data generated field almost mandatory however basic approach data collection management remained largely unchanged past year indeed becoming especially difficult integrate take advantage information provided patient bedside monitoring treatment device critical patient information traditionally registered nursing staff collect representative value period usually hour chart used baseline patient evolution assessed given patient monitoring chart costly prepare centre replaced type record keeping automatic random data collection different clinical information system usually collect one data point per parameter every min mean information generated bedside lost possibility reaping benefit exploitation could mean patient healthcare system addition provide processing analysis information obtained thus although system provide access piece data per minute volume data make routine manual evaluation healthcare personnel difficult information still lost intensive care unit icu team continue express frustration current patient data representation therefore new approach use information generated bedside

attributable measurement method data processing moreover processing ensured mode median still maintained certain level clinical utility nonetheless given importance variable simultaneously monitor using capnography spirometry well thereby allowing isolate discrepancy type thus example increase measured impedance usually related patient movement finally say highest degree accuracy manual record match automatic calculation central tendency therefore absence major measurement artifact consider automatic central tendency calculation used gold standard assessing patient evolution like central tendency parameter clinical evolutionary assessment minimum 1st percentile maximum 99th percentile hourly calculation simple care staff based patient age clinical situation interestingly despite selection percentile haemodynamic respiratory stability patient significant clinical difference minimum maximum hourly calculation corresponding nursing reference fig table note similar variation also described finding indicate automatic random sampling ass evolution important parameter differ significantly according sampling conducted could explain part so-called smoothing effect word trend toward normal average physiology nursing anaesthesia record hence operating room icu smoothing phenomenon could indicate opposite inaccuracy random sample impaired ability reflect true clinical situation patient therefore highlight need monitor modify automatic random registration thus given line author also believe random vital sign measurement require supervision thereby making inefficient conclusion current discard information generated bedside benefit storage processing exploitation could entail lost furthermore random automatic data collection perform must supervised healthcare personnel making inefficient however new generation hddcis used anaesthesia critical care medicine could overcome limitation system avoid data loss improve data processing integration support development personalised therapeutic regimen although research still needed validate potential individualising therapeutic finding indicate automatic hourly vital sign calculation central tendency could replace manual anaesthesia critical care record thereby freeing highly qualified staff demanding task
