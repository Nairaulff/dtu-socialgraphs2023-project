complete remission much frequent t1d partial remission however similar factor influencing onset duration related early diagnosis better residual pancreatic b-cell secretory function quantitative difference factor lower hba1c higher c-peptide level influence whether complete remission partial remission remission occurs result therefore highlight importance early diagnosis t1d achieve partial
