introduction tuberculosis serious global public health challenge due associated disability death contagious nature long incubation period insidious onset leading delayed diagnosis severe long-term consequence although curable statistic several country including pakistan remain alarming according report estimated 1.6 million people died due 10.6 million new case occurred globally including million men 3.4 million woman 1.2 million child pakistan stand sixth among high-burden country incidence rate 264/100,000 compared 3/100 according world bank report mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb main causative agent despite significant advance identifying mtb case treatment eradication significant lack information initial immune response mtb human known well-reported adaptive immunity play important role pathogenesis early stage mtb infection cell-mediated immune response required localize mtb particular lung area mainly associated expression cytokines/chemokines essential recruitment inflammatory cell site infection including il-1β il-2 il-12 ifnγ tnfα contrast cytokine associated anti-inflammatory profile including il-4 il-13 il-10 counteract pro-inflammatory response help mtb
