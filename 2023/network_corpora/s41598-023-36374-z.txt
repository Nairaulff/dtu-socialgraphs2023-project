introduction tennis player often experience posterior shoulder pain due restricted internal rotation range motion rom shoulder joint one common cause shoulder pain limited rom reported posterior shoulder stiffness contracture reduced rom glenohumeral joint affect shoulder performance loss glenohumeral joint common overhead athlete known glenohumeral internal rotation deficiency gird tightness posterior soft tissue shoulder joint posterior shoulder capsule rotator cuff posterior deltoid muscle may lead impingement syndrome rotator cuff injury labral lesion young vigorous overhead athlete particularly tennis player likely internal impingement tennis game place high pressure player joint supraphysiological force generated hundred time per match shoulder elbow joint reported acute injury frequently occur lower extremity among tennis player whereas chronic injury frequently occur upper extremity tennis serve complicated stroke involves segmental rotation throughout kinetic chain repeated external rotation tennis serve cocking phase may reduce rom increase rom external shoulder rotation dominant arm deceleration phase serve creates large compressive force shoulder player repetitive force suggested result secondary change muscle present posteriorly shoulder joint teres minor infraspinatus posterior deltoid latissimus dorsi shoulder joint capsule result altered rom due change scapular biomechanic adaptation favor biomechanical obstruction increase risk rotator cuff musculotendinous injury athlete adaptation include decrease upward rotation scapula increase sternoclavicular elevation increase anterior tilt protraction scapula dropped scapula rest position posterior shoulder stiffness contribute alteration rotational axis head humerus sort stiffness cause head humerus shift superior posterior direction causing increase external rotation decrease rom ultimately resulting abnormality shoulder rom athlete overhead athlete frequently perform posterior

rotation deficiency gird many study indicated overhead athlete external rotation shoulder joint marcondes studied amateur tennis player measure posterior shoulder stiffness rotator cuff strength posterior shoulder tightness author reported severe posterior capsule tightness reduced rom athlete shoulder pain according manske overhead athlete required external rotation serve tennis ball mile per hour velocity without losing glenohumeral joint myers reported relationship posterior shoulder tightness impingement syndrome harryman demonstrated passive shoulder flexion selective tightness posterior region shoulder capsule generates obligatory anterior superior translation humeral head irregular motion could cause soft tissue impingement subacromial region requiring overhead sport work

significant difference mssg mcbsg overhead athlete commonly perform posterior shoulder stretching part shoulder injury prevention program burkhart described sleeper stretch performed person side-lying affected side shoulder elbow flexed 90° non-affected hand performs passive affected side position may result subacromial impingement burkhart also described rollover sleeper stretch shoulder flexed 50° 60° person rolled forward 30° 40° vertical author believed rollover sleeper stretch forceful method might cause pain many athlete performed cautiously tyler described cross-body horizontal adduction stretch improve shoulder affected arm lifted around 90° flexion pushed across body horizontal adduction force opposite arm inadequacy stretching method selectively stretch posterior capsule challenged although biomechanical study tissue strain testing conducted approve disapprove theory physician believe scapulothoracic tissue may stretched stretch considered necessary stretch posterior soft tissue rather posterior capsule wilk reported stretching technique called horizontal adduction stretch scapular stabilization selectively stretch glenohumeral joint posterior tissue subject supine therapist stabilizes scapula one hand applies horizontal adduction moment humerus hand therapist stabilizes scapula posterior scapular muscle get tissue stretch salamh showed horizontal adduction stretch performed scapular stabilization improved rom posterior shoulder tightness horizontal adduction stretch without scapular stabilization wilk proposed modification two commonly performed stretch mcbs keystone study mcclure compared various stretching procedure used reduce posterior shoulder tightness showed cross-body stretch effective sleeper stretch author suggested may due pain inconvenient position sleeper stretch position study showed pain discomfort significantly another study laudner showed sleeper stretch produce statistically significant acute improvement posterior shoulder tightness mcbs scapula stabilized better conventional cross-body stretch thereby increasing shoulder rom effectively several limitation scope future research mentioned like rom measurement performed manually leading possibility human error reducing study accuracy participant selected present study without pain symptom study carried participant pain symptom large sample size establish greater generalizability future study also carried different overhead sport long-term follow-up needed conclusion mcbs improved upper limb function rom shoulder joint selected sample population lawn tennis player difference observed stretching technique improving upper limb function rom shoulder joint therefore either two stretching technique used improve upper limb function rom
