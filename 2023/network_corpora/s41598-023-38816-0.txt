introduction understanding pattern community diversity pattern emerge one significant challenge ecology requires going beyond simple counting specie community assembly process factor interspecific interaction habitat availability heterogeneity proposed major determinant shaping specie abundance distribution however study ecological interaction mainly focus competition predation key driver specie diversity parasitism received comparatively attention particularly important considering abundance ubiquity extraordinary diversity parasite impact animal diversity comparable predator
