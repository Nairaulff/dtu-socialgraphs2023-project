chronic stress lack energy motivation make student interested study prone develop academic burnout moreover regard health life habit factor related academic burnout found self-reported excessive alcohol consumption use antidepressant associated colleague-related burnout teacher-related burnout association burnout syndrome consumption alcohol widely reported although limited number study examined relationship among graduate student vulnerable situation student emotional conflict academia environment excess activity competitiveness pointed contributing factor development high level stress alcohol misuse excessive alcohol consumption may viewed dysfunctional coping mechanism since student may abuse alcohol strategy regulating tension stressful situation academia use antidepressant also observed way coping adversity academia already known academic stressor related stress anxiety depression combined extra load studying well need enhance performance concentration student may resort use antidepressant avoid episode social anxiety depressive behaviour finding consistent study reported student use antidepressant present high level burnout misuse alcohol and/or substance linked burnout neglecting lead serious consequence limitation study important limitation cross-sectional study design limited ability establish causality association online assessment
