often interest relationship feeding artery aneurysm sac anatomical feature aneurysm body neck thrombus proportion aneurysm t2el-related re-intervention factor treated endovascular surgery t2els formed incompletely occluded branch artery continuously provide blood gap stent graft arterial wall thus t2el generally originates inferior mesenteric artery lumbar artery accessory renal artery main branch
