introduction sodium play relatively unusual role within ecosystem nonessential element plant yet critically essential element animal consumer decomposers e.g. bacteria fungi case plant unable entirely prevent uptake sodium substrate important consequence plant fitness physiological effect impacting community assembly structure across space time essential element animal sodium play important role osmoregulatory process promotes muscle neural tissue development control blood movement among function posing challenge animal forager availability sodium across terrestrial environment e.g. soil plant highly heterogeneous overall environmental variation available sodium stoichiometric mismatch i.e. difference plant animal need influence animal behaviour performance especially among herbivorous non-carnivorous animal since animal prey provides sufficient sodium instance sodium-deficient habitat insufficient dietary sodium promotes geophagy e.g. salt lick visitation uptake mineral-rich water e.g. puddling cause selective consumption sodium-rich plant tissue induces migratory behaviour change animal population density promote shift omnivorous diet toward higher trophic level craving sodium appears shared many terrestrial aquatic animal representing conserved condition especially strict primary consumer whose dietary need rely solely primary producer strict herbivore
