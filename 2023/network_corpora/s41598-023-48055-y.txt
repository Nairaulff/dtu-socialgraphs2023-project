potential despite different appearance two cpps illustration doe show cost investigation patient volume theoretical potential reducing investigation time unless cost investigation indicates opposite inclusion criterion urothelial cpp strike inappropriately generous fortunately also appears case colorectal cancer cpp common one excess resource consumption would major negative impact context however several aspect require attention first excess investigation time increase patient waiting time doe also correspond excess use healthcare resource might resource use merely spread longer period hand waiting time could burdensome time patient fearing cancer diagnosis hoping opposite thus excess time could associated avoidable quality life decrement analysis doe show excess time affect patient prognosis process leading cancer dismissal diagnosis still view partial picture inclusion criterion cpps regularly discussed reviewed necessary wider inclusion greater chance discovering cancer also individual requiring investigation potentially resulting period worry lower quality life high proportion suspicion rejected could correspond unnecessary quality life loss wider inclusion could discover cancer earlier improve prognosis compared awaiting symptomatic cancer later stage cancer mean worse prognosis patient often require intensive treatment investigation patient requires resource increase cost earlier discovery cancer might offset treatment cost better prognosis appears undeniably beneficial comprehensive evaluation cost quality life associated use cpps inclusion criterion

overall suggest follow-up study e.g survival faced complex analysis many cpps inclusion criterion range different outcome combined numerous different cancer diagnosis chose approach map patient
