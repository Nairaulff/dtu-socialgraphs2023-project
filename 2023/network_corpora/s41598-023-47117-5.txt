introduction wild japanese garlic allium macrostemon bunge also known chinese garlic english no-biru japanese belongs amaryllidaceae family plant naturally distributed across eastern russia eastern mongolia mainland china taiwan korea japan utilized traditional east asian medicine century addition serving food source macrostemon notably popular edible allium specie korea northeastern china russia primarily bulb pickling however japan use plant deviate pattern mostly harvested wild occasionally sold local market cultivation limited small scale hence despite extensive distribution macrostemon currently considered neglected crop japan possibly due low yield leading underutilization historical reference suggest plant used medicinally japan mention classical japanese literature point active utilization past waka poem referencing plant appear kojiki record ancient matter compiled manyoshu collection ten thousand leaf anthology various waka poem written one waka poem manyoshu

genetic diversity macrostemon japan could shed light enigma plant posse significant medicinal property renowned analgesic immune-boosting anti-asthmatic capability traditional east asian medicine recent investigation chemical compound found macrostemon revealed impressive potential medical application bulb rich steroidal saponin show promise treating condition like acute myocardial ischemia hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia visceral obesity steroidal saponin also exhibit cytotoxic activity human cancer cell line moreover aqueous extract dried bulb reportedly show antidepressant-like analgesic effect leaf macrostemon contain valuable constituent flavonoid caffeic acid phenolic compound suggesting potential utility herbal medicine additionally plant volatile organic compound posse medicinal property including lipid-lowering anti-atherosclerosis effect discovery underscore remarkable potential macrostemon herbal medicine despite numerous study exploring medicinal component macrostemon genetic diversity remains understudied however understanding genetic diversity crucial provides vital tool monitoring evaluating population aid conservation planning macrostemon moreover knowledge plant genetic diversity allows plant breeder develop improve new cultivar desirable trait pest disease resistance high yield potential superior characteristic compared traditional dna marker single nucleotide polymorphism snp abundant plant genome making superior tool identifying plant diversity advance high-throughput sequencing technology significantly reduced cost improved efficiency obtaining snp marker particularly restriction site-associated dna sequencing rad-seq method facilitates reduced representation individual genome rad-seq variation termed double-digest rad-seq ddrad-seq utilizes two restriction enzyme cut genome compared traditional rad-seq method ddrad-seq library preparation costly quicker requires genomic material consequently ddrad-seq become preferred
