actual subgroup analysis although effect value cohort study lower whole study overall statistical difference also explained follow-up time study found study follow-up time year larger effect value overall study small trial low quality methodology compared large trial may partly account small-study effect overestimating effect size meanwhile meta-regression publication year revealed publication year also factor contributing higher heterogeneity study higher effect size found literature published earlier year 2000–2009 several possible explanation finding firstly possible earlier literature relied self-made questionnaire assessment could led inclusion child yet developed thus affecting consistency result passage time diagnosis assessment method allergic rhinitis continuously improved standardized also explained subgroup analysis diagnostic mode additionally likely heterogeneity result also influenced advancement research method medical technology different time period change may include accurate standardized data collection method well utilization advanced medical technology treatment method factor could contribute increased heterogeneity result across different time period conclusion incorporating adjusted effect size finding gotten conclusion overall risk child delivered c-section increased increased c-section parental history allergy addition elective c-section higher risk compared whole study observed overall risk child delivered c-section increased consistent result previous study c-section allergic disease previous study shown c-section increase risk asthma food allergy allergic dermatitis child offspring subgroup analysis family history allergy found c-section family history allergy increased risk child developing heterogeneity reduced one possible explanation reduced heterogeneity within subgroup shared genetic predisposition allergy among family member shared genetic background could contribute consistent pattern allergic reaction therefore lower heterogeneity subgroup addition genetic factor family often share similar living condition dietary habit exposure potential allergen environmental influence within family could contribute reduced heterogeneity family history allergy common risk factor allergic disease offspring c-section family history allergy higher risk child overall c-section demonstrates interaction gene environment play important role development disease many study shown delivery c-section associated increased risk disease associated allergic disease offspring study generally discriminated effect acute elective c-section study observed child born elective c-section higher chance developing similar result found study cohort study conducted denmark included 750,569 participant showed elective c-section higher effect emergency c-section risk asthma behzad darabi meta-analysis also found child delivered elective c-section higher risk asthma child delivered emergency c-section etiology behind

rural area may antenatal childhood contact farm animal rural environment resulted low prevalence child owing multiple exposure mediate strong protective epigenetic modification microflora diversity

increasing prevalence child based hygiene hypothesis study needed determine underlying genetic epigenetic mechanism focusing role early allergen difference epidemiological study time study also shown difference colonization neonatal intestinal flora caused caesarean section also related allergic disease offspring developmental starting point infant gut microbiota still unknown undoubtedly process delivery seems key point development neonatal microbiota baby born via c-section miss initial exposure mother microbiota instead colonized primarily skin environmental microorganism present operating room intestinal microflora infant born higher abundance bifidobacterium lactobacillus escherichia coli bacteroides demonstrating greater intestinal microbial diversity conversely microbiome infant born via c-section show increased prevalence either skin flora potentially pathogenic microbial community klebsiella enterococcus clostridium several explanation mechanism firstly shohei akagawa point child born c-section characteristic reduced bacteroides decreased butyric acid concentration gut decrease butyric acid concentration inhibits differentiation immature cell tregs crucial suppressing excessive immune response impairment immune system ability suppress excessive immune response lead development allergic disease secondly evidence low α-diversity relative abundance particular gut-commensal bacteria genus associated childhood respiratory disease however higher relative abundance bacteroidaceae clostridiaceae enterobacteriaceae lower relative abundance bifidobacteriaceae lactobacillaceae associated development allergy addition study shown elective c-section associated higher risk might newborn contact c-section related contaminant exposed maternal genital tract microbiome due factor premature rupture membrane resulting partial restoration newborn bacterial community level similar baby born conclusion mode delivery significance factor affecting composition intestinal flora newborn infant play important role development immune system large number study consistently observed c-section could lead increased incidence child therefore experiment observational study effect c-section allergic disease child several societal factor may contribute rise c-section rate include fear among pregnant woman doctor desire avoid unknown medical risk cultural religious difference certain region therefore order reduce c-section rate recommended consider individual circumstance medical indication delivery including limited strictly defining indication cesarean section
