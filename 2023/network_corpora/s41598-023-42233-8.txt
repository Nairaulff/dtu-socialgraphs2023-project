discomfort study control oral condition use dental prosthesis number teeth needed strength study lie novelty confirming association osa dental pain emphasizing clinical significance dental issue osa vice versa addition according obesity criterion proposed korean population cut-off level bmi neck circumference changed kg/m 36.3 respectively modified screening test osa tailored korean population reported good sensitivity specificity furthermore large representative sample size korean population statistical adjustment national health examination survey enhanced reliability study large sample size coupled stratified multilevel probability sampling improves precision finding also allows statistical adjustment various potential confounding factor related osa enhancing generalizability finding despite strength study several limitation first reliance self-report questionnaire subjective oral health assessment may introduce bias individual could either underestimate overestimate oral health condition owing various factor including fear treatment unawareness difficulty perceiving early sign oral disease second owing large nationwide scope survey diagnosis osa could confirmed using overnight polysomnography finally cross-sectional design study limited establishment causality osa dental pain chewing discomfort allowing evidence association additionally study account oral health factor oral health behavior number remaining teeth removable denture use prospective longitudinal study needed validate finding presented study conclusion within limitation cross-sectional study high
