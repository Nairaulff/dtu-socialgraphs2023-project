introduction microtia congenital malformation associated abnormal migration neural crest cell first second branchial arch embryonic stage presentation auricular deformity range mild structural anormality severe absence ear often accompanied hearing loss second common congenital craniofacial condition cleft lip reported prevalence microtia range 0.83 17.4 per 10,000 birth depending race region sex even altitude although microtia commonly occurs isolated anomaly also present component specific congenital malformation syndrome goldenhar treacher-collins branchio-oto-renal nager syndrome others therefore microtia known combine organ anomaly urinary anomaly according report occur time likely microtia patient comparing general population includes various renal abnormality horseshoe kidney vesicoureteral reflux renal agenesis sameer also found patient isolated syndromic microtia may risk renal anomaly may undetected birth therefore renal ultrasound screening recommended patient ear anomaly accompanied dysmorphic feature also non-syndromic patient however clear guideline concerning appropriate urinary screening protocol patient microtia addition previous study focused urological structural abnormality microtia patient little attention paid urinary functional abnormality compared structural study functional study equally important perhaps meaningful early detection disease organ system therefore attention paid functional screening urinary system patient presenting microtia hematuria including macroscopic hematuria microscopic hematuria one important sign urinary functional abnormality may indicate occurrence asymptomatic urinary disease early stage hence present study going identify incidence characteristic hematuria patient microtia method study population

retrospective study large patient cohort hospital serf investigation relationship microtia hematuria aspect demographic data cohort fairly representative known epidemiologic data microtia patient population 76.5 male consistent known epidemiological trend patient population word present study suggested high incidence hematuria patient microtia compared pigmented nevus patient control group esprcially female child hematuria one common clinical symptom related urinary system important laboratory sign renal disease child addition hematuria aslo played important role diagnosis treatment chronic kidney disease acute kidney injury although vast majority microscopic hematuria benign especially child presenting isolated asymptomatic microscopic hematuria still proportion patient could progressive aggravation even progress end-stage renal disease esrd addition mastaneh reported incidence esrd child persistent asymptomatic hematuria nearly time higher child without hematuria several study demonstrated prevalence rate hematuria child 0.59 1.1 3.86 respectively china addition positive rate hematuria ranged 0.1 1.2 according epidemiological investigation child hematuria country korea japan iran present study prevalence rate hematuria microtia girl reported markedly increased comparing literature many factor affect prevalence hematuria examination standard equipment operator age group selected child geographic region ethnic background etc known study clinical implication overall prevalence rate hematuria girl higher male 4.12 1.89 incidence hematuria female child prevalent compared male age group although epidemiological study also found hematuria prevalent girl compared male difference observed positive rate hematuria male girl control group hematuria multitude cause considering higher incidence hematuria coexisted microtia urological dyplasia still considered first step association ear urorlogical abnormality long recognized however connection two disparate organ always straightforward although alport syndrome auricular renal manifestation well-known disorder need considered differential diagnosis patient ear kidney abnormality commonality present kidney ear number structural protein developmentally important transcription factor ciliary protein channelproteins mutation pathway lead disease organ system study microtia child positive hematuria underwent ultrasound examination renal abnormality observed considering known relationship microtia renal anomaly hidden kidney structural abnormality might missed ultrasound like glomerular structural abnormality thin basement membrane nephropathy caused collagen chain alteration common cause microscopic hematuria child diagnosis confirmed electron microscopy diffuse basement membrane lamellation bioposy besides term another common urologiccal manifestation accompanied microtia vesicoureteral reflux accuracy renal ultrasound diagnosis low sensitivity 18–46 absence pyelectasis modality change known vesicoureteral reflux frequently detected cause pediatric recurrent urinary tract infection case incidence 30–50 primary concern vesicoureteral reflux risk recurrent pyelonephritis epidemiologically pyelonephritis common woman girl outnumbered male among young infant may underlying cause significantly higher incidence hematuria girl observed present study historically child grade vesicoureteral reflux thought substantial risk permanent renal damage early detection appropriate management vesicoureteral reflux child important approach improve renal outcome therefore use renal ultrasound screen renal structural abnormality patient microtia may delay optimal timing treatment due lack clear guideline concerning appropriate renal screening protocol patient microtia patient underwent renal ultrasonography study addition even structure normal functional abnormality ruled finding study prompted pay attention renal structural abnormality also concern functional index sign renal help detect prevent treat disease early present attention paid study asymptomatic hematuria japan korea taiwan mass urinary screening program child established many year urinalysis simple screening test kidney disease child useful inexpensive widely available non-invasive easy carried widely population therefore suggest hematuria used supplementary test screening renal congenital malformation patient microtia help earlier recognition microtia associated renal anomaly perform earlier nephrological urological intervention decrease fewer subsequent renal complication one strength study firstly investigated incidence characteristic hematuria patient microtia china able provide valuable insight incidence microscopic hematuria female pediatric microtia patient addition hospital leading authority auricle reconstruction attracting country microtia patient treatment strength study relatively large sample size variety disease certain representativeness however several limitation study considered interpreting present result firstly study single-center retrospective study renal ultrasound result patient included large sample size incomplete data might lead omission factor would affect hematuria nephrolithiasis renal tumor etc secondly due methodological limitation false negative result could exist another limitation origin red blood cell urine could identified lacking phase contrast microscopy finally analyzed result single urinalysis definition involving lower threshold without continuous monitoring follow-up child positive hematuria acknowledge general definition hematuria involving higher threshold decision use conservative range aimed identify even minor occurrence hematuria may hold clinical significance particularly context pediatric microtia patient need conduct multicenter prospective study large number patient reliability data validate result offer accurate basis clinical diagnosis treatment prognosis conclusion higher incidence hematuria observed female child microtia similar result obtained control group suggest hematuria used supplementary test screening renal congenital malformation female child microtia help earlier recognition microtia associated renal anomaly perform earlier nephrology urology intervention decrease fewer downstream renal complication
