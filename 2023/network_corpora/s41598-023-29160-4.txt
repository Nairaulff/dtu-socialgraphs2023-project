introduction screening mammography widely used breast cancer screening tool imaging modality proven significantly lower breast cancer mortality guideline obtaining screening mammography image relatively clear widely followed two standard view breast namely craniocaudal mediolateral oblique mlo view commonly used imaging technique however imaging guideline screening mammography patient breast implant remain unclear therefore different set mammogram usually acquired screening patient breast implant depending institution standard mammography screening may include four image without implant mlo view eight image without implant mlo view six image consisting four image without implant mlo view two image without implant view report mammography implant incurs higher radiation dose mammography without implant current imaging protocol many institution include mammography implant unclear whether beneficial cancer detection study comparing benefit loss mammography without implant respect relation mammography image quality performance breast cancer detection rare available published study compared radiation dose according mammography technique even mammography implant higher radiation dose may still benefit image provide additional information increase ease breast cancer detection contrary little benefit cancer detection considering higher radiation dose image used screening date research data support evidence-based decision-making lacking lack guidance led wide variation mammography practice breast implant result heterogeneous examination varying image quality

retromammary fat margin peripheral breast tissue included image however standard mlo image implant included breast parenchyma pushed behind implant pressed without spreading properly contrast obtaining mlo image breast gentle hand pushing maneuver displaces implant posteriorly peripheral portion breast also pushed back together thus mlo view without implant difficult fully include peripheral portion breast breast pulled inside field implant pushed outside field included breast parenchyma spread well compressed without obstacle importantly mlo view showed significantly higher score term image resolution result support image resolution appropriate compression contrast absence blurring important cancer visibility proper positioning breast implant criterion proper positioning account majority score clinical image evaluation mammogram correct positioning essential prerequisite obtaining appropriate image patient without implant using mammography general image score well proper positioning also high resolution score however also applies absence implant study showed mlo image received lower positioning score higher score resolution cancer detection rate suggesting patient implant inevitable little tissue posterior aspect breast cut image due implant pushed back however necessarily equate poor clinical imaging quality institution mammography breast implant includes standard mlo image addition four image mlo view concerned small breast cancer lesion peripheral part breast may excluded obtaining mlo view however even breast cancer lesion peripheral part breast may clearly included via standard mlo image compression breast tissue standard mlo image sufficient likely result breast tissue overlapping tissue thus hiding cancer lesion periphery study case mlo view detected breast cancer standard mlo view small peripheral part breast tissue visible based result suggest routine screening mammography trying inclusion imf retromammary fat obtaining mlo view breast would preferable adding standard mlo image eklund showed modified compression mammogram improved imaging augmented breast however stated modified compression mammogram added mention whether standard image without maintained whether modified compression mammogram alone sufficient real studied image quality mammogram performed patient breast implant however compare mammography without implant analyzed image quality mammogram breast implant multiple center performed various projection technique author suggested current criterion evaluating image quality mammogram fully applicable patient implant study compared standard mlo view mlo view patient thus far result meaningful informative reducing radiation dose screening tool mammography recognized increasingly important due development mammographic equipment technology even breast thickness increased significantly standard mlo view including implant radiation dose significantly increased compared view 0.97 mgy 0.95 mgy 0.0954 although radiation dose view high total dose received patient took view higher achievable mean dose screening 1.1 0.5 mgy exceeded acceptable dose level 2.00 mgy suggests obtaining mlo standard mlo image breast cancer screening may lead increase radiation dose without particular benefit breast cancer detection sometimes mammography performed evaluate implant rupture case view including implant essential however general accurate evaluate implant rupture using mri breast ultrasonography rather mammography screening mammography designed evaluate condition implant detect breast cancer hence routinely performing standard mlo view mammography breast cancer screening detect asymptomatic rupture implant recommended study limitation first compared image quality standard mlo mlo image using clinical image quality criterion score used evaluate quality screening mammography criterion fully applicable mammography implant however criterion used objective criterion evaluation mammogram implant second study compared two different method mammography acquisition breast implant mlo view medical center screening mammography imaging protocol patient breast implant usually include mlo view additional two mlo view without rather view third compare result two different mammographic unit analyze data separately according mammographic unit possibility relative dose standard mlo view different according mammographic system finally study single-center study population predominantly woman dense breast subpectoral silicon implant population result may institution performed mammography way regardless breast size type volume implant additional study multiple center required applying different acquisition method type size implant may obtain different result conclusion screening mammography patient breast implant acquiring standard mlo mlo view benefit compared mlo view alone mlo projection mlo view sufficient expected reduce patient radiation dose without reducing capability breast cancer detection especially dense breast subpectoral implant
