bonitation value football turf highly variable depending year observation examination area prolonged observation turf therefore exciting tool determining period rapid decline quality turf select appropriate date renovation primarily observed area lowest visual functional value goal area penalty box also similar result obtained previous work experiment conducted grabowski phenomenon may related fact place mainly exploited critical area associated gaining advantage game increased probability scoring goal additionally research ruiz-ruiz showed entering penalty area considered indicator performance differentiating winning losing team hence high inrun frequency defending attacking player could cause trampled grass lose quality resulting deterioration density overall aspect turf area penalty box goal area classified particularly susceptible wear excessive surface damage addition area particularly risk creating plantless spot due goalkeeper intervention fig result body falling ground damaging surface requiring overseeding always possible due ongoing league season seen obtained result lower tendency deteriorate quality along turf age area characterized higher functional value middle area playing area first evaluation period therefore likely penalty box goal area tended deteriorate functional value intensity use may damaged i.e due frequent massive trampling first year use high level damage could make grass unable regenerate fill gap turf due continued intensive use league match training tournament year grass mixture allowed torn quickly fill spot damaged mark however confirm thesis future observation throughout league season continuous monitoring quality turf every match/training unit necessary figure typical turf damage within penalty box/goal area due goalkeeper intervention photo full size image research also showed high variability evaluated parameter overall aspect density color functional value seasonality year observation general parameter

significantly aging turf clear downward trend functional value turf aging turf first case concern middle area playing area probably area degraded player made grass regenerate quickly surface could renovated straightforward way allowed continuity similar visual functional characteristic turf second case occurs mainly penalty box goal area one potential explanation probably explained continuing degradation area year due high importance game additionally depending composition grass density shoot change significantly year research shown age complex cenoses density shoot increase monotype decrease true initially diversified mixture grass various composition sown evaluated football field three-species mix however previous experiment allowed conclude year share individual component lawn mixture undergoes significant change compared original composition maintenance almost impossible phenomenon could especially true lolium perenne highest share initial mixture showed unfavorable reaction temperature fluctuation summer drought hence percentage specie develop dense shoot may increased turf decreasing shoot density especially penalty box playing area area significantly contributed deterioration functional value turf correlate visual turf quality however confirm statement subsequent research focus observing specie composition turf change many year examination conclusion main conclusion performed observation conducted assessment showed based long-term observation year visual functional characteristic intensively used natural grass turf differ significantly term seasonality year observation playing field area turf better aesthetic value noted spring season penalty box goal area negligible favorable functional value differed significantly respect middle area playing field showed relatively high value visual-functional parameter phenomenon likely dictated fact area critical area term gaining advantage game frequent run tackle intervention potential create area without plant require additional overseeding often impossible season due possibility cavity frequent intervention goalkeeper ending body falling onto turf damaging grass surface additionally case downward trend functional value observed age turf essential find context use intensively used natural grass turf context estimating timing field renovation financial outlay related maintaining turf properly limitation research despite standard methodology parameterization result several factor could disturbed long-term observation turf proposed manuscript addition complexity visual statement aesthetic turf worth mentioning among others possibility changing percentage grass specie variety could significantly change entire field long observation period addition observation football match training unit conducted turf performed damage could occurred way mentioned conclusion discussion also worth noting despite training session conducted across entire turf area could exploited heavily making easier degrade match future recommendation manuscript also creates space research context observing long-term change functional visual characteristic natural turf shorter observation interval determining change percentage share grass specie variety turf impact visual functional characteristic specified period addition recommended carefully observe turf training/match
