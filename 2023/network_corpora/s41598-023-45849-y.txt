introduction music played significant role society culture throughout human history ancestor began producing music way mimic natural sound religious entertainment activity still debate regarding whether music began vocalization rhythmic pattern anthropoid motor impulse many believe human voice percussion one earliest instrument create human-made music another note rhythm essential element music generated independently archaeologist also discovered various primitive instrument flute dating back 35,000 year ago past present invention music theory idealization evidently developed giving rise unique musical composition renaissance composer provided basis eventually became baroque style baroque composer began writing music sophisticated band later evolved full orchestra bach vivaldi undoubtedly outstanding composer age many composer classical era notably mozart beethoven experimented various form melodic idea instrument resulting creation various noteworthy well-regarded musical piece piano sonata no.11 requiem mass minor fidelio op.72 etc romantic music brought chopin schumann brahms many others marked emotional expression musical dynamic century human unceasingly developed music theory gain better understanding music ranging notation defined representing sound formalizing rule principle arranging sound hence humanity continually acquires many rigid foundation music
