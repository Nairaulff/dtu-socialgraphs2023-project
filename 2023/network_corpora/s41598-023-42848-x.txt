meta-analysis compare early surgical versus conservative management spondylodiscitis meta-analysis included study comprising data 10,954 patient finding showed early surgery lower mortality rate vs. conservative treatment lower relapse/failure rate vs. early surgery also led shorter hospital stay 7.75 day per patient result consistently favoured early surgical management pyogenic spondylodiscitis surgical debridement widely accepted therapy treatment infectious disease reduce infection load facilitate faster infection control also providing tissue sample may help optimise adjunct antibiotic therapy generally surgery effective infection poorly penetrated antibiotic well locally contained infection abscess however interestingly meta-analysis found early surgery effective conservative therapy patient purely sea early surgery even effective spondylodiscitis without sea 10.06 day versus 6.5 length stay reduction reduction mortality versus reduction relapse rate compared finding instigates question could mechanism surgery achieves better outcome spondylodiscitis patient involve debridement one hypothesis suggests spinal stabilization achieved surgical intervention may substantial contributing factor even though antibiotic essential treating infection unable provide spinal stability infection may lead spinal macro-instability predisposing patient experience pain decreased postural control decreased arc movement however recognize existing evidence base may robust enough draw definitive conclusion mechanism invite study explore hypothesis study inform clinical practice whilst undertook exhaustive search enabling largest pooled analysis kind alongside multiple robust approach managing data heterogeneity ultimately source evidence largely retrospective and/or cohort design suffered heterogeneity outcome reporting definition held moderate risk bias furthermore included study largely report use intra-operative localised antibiotic shown promising result recent study hence possible perform sensitivity analysis parameter despite seemingly promising outcome associated early surgery recognize emphasize limitation inherent study primary study included meta-analysis largely retrospective cohort design harbouring moderate risk bias outcome reporting heterogeneity also crucial account probable selection bias study healthiest patient likely selected early surgery selection bias may partially explain observed lower mortality relapse rate early surgery group moreover apart difference patient health disease severity may also influence choice timing treatment well outcome however study provide data disease severity potentially surgical approach may act proxy marker disease severity however data surgical approach heterogeneous compared future study reporting disease severity well using consensus-based comparable operative protocol required allow robust sensitivity analysis furthermore statistical suggestion publication bias albeit extensive subgroup analysis identify specific outlying study factor considering limitation absolute change outcome threshold population probable selection bias relapse/failure early surgery still high versus remain difficult interpret study considered health economics early surgery superficially saving eight hospital bed day may sufficient trade-off cost risk routine surgery considering reconfiguration service enable early surgery would substantial spinal surgery tertiary specialty clear remain significant knowledge translation gap striking finding may lack randomised comparison three reason firstly strong rationale current evidence secondly significant increasing burden spondylodiscitis disease finally evidence field-wide equipoise premise randomised comparison however important acknowledge obstacle enabling randomised control trial spondylodiscitis management firstly clear consensus constitutes early surgery conservative therapy perhaps importantly constitutes spondylodiscitis particularly context sea principal outcome measure success criterion also remain undefined secondly whilst may clinical equipoise field-wide level doe necessarily translate institutional physician-level equipoise—future effort must made reduce local deviation field-level recommendation practice including increased communication latest finding raise awareness finally relative infrequency spondylodiscitis population treatment heterogeneity coupled discrimination outcome measure pain neurological function suggest trial would require large probably multi-national
