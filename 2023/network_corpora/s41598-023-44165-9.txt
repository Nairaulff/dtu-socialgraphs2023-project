considered evaluate possible solution error detected rehabilitation session full size table solution hand position relative hmd issue category issue related position hand relative hmd see fig c-i c-i solve six possible strategy applied adding external camera solution would provide second viewpoint perform hand tracking would allow tracking hand even visible hmd would come limitation due fixed position external camera additional processing needed would high computational cost external camera would need processed external computer hand-tracking information communicated via networking positional feedback solution would add feedback system notifies patient head turn far would fix issue per would allow patient know range turn head back mirror iii limiting exercise area solution would avoid object placed far away virtual mirror main drawback greatly reduces available motion range alternative hand tracking algorithm solution would use third-party library hand tracking algorithm may provide stable robust result may able guess position fingers/hand even directly visible however solution valid case meta quest headset hmd camera reserved meta quest sdk library directly available video source application developer although would possible use external camera benefit would low compared placing external camera away hmd using controller controller device provided along commercial hmds solution allows tracking hand way doe rely computer vision greatly limit movement patient requires patient able grip controller consider cumbersome option negative patient rehabilitation experience despite additional cost using haptic glove glove contain hardware track position hand similar way controller also individual position tracker glove finger report information hmd addition haptic glove apply force attempted motion hand simulating size shape material property object glove highly expensive ranging multiple thousand euro making high-cost solution addition glove may hard

automatically response patient head turning side side align direction head position hand relative mirror changed cause mirror hand change position without patient making movement hand effect partially mitigated applying smoothing movement threshold avoid constant movement rapid movement even possible solution could cause confusion disorientation patient loss sense mirror hand iii animate hand crossing solution would add animation hand crossing moving opposite side virtual mirror animation would start hand moving direction mirror attempting cross mean target close mirror animation place prevent grabbing interacting make main hand invisible would also disable interaction invisible hand object scene solution fix issue hand interacting since one hand however since patient look mirror hand likely main hand range hand-tracking camera make main hand non-interactive would disable interaction main hand object scene would display hand special way translucent indicate meant used make

presented multiple way kind highlight/blinking mirror hand animation ghost hand pointing right direction arrow highlight objective solution would make next objective randomly selected objective light blink show ghost hand indicating action patient supposed take solution would use system used exercise demonstration tutorial would perform example movement way draw attention objective limit exercise area solution would use reduced exercise area reducing distracting element outside area patient attention better focused exercise solution except last one feedback strategy evaluated primarily limiting exercise area final remark conclude section table evaluation solution using proposed measure summarized sake simplicity emphasize solution considered best one although reference option also given since one solution possible table seen c-i issue solution using external camera would considerable computational cost beyond achievable standalone headset already loaded rehabilitation exercise solution doe fix issue since hand still lose track solution iii limiting exercise area cost requires mindful creating exercise however due limited area range movement exercised solution viable use external camera similar limitation solution solution using controller using haptic glove considered negative experience patient solution high cost top based evaluation result solution iii one provides advantage least drawback solution good alternative since feasibility parameter applies mostly added cost external tracking camera small computer process tracking data concern solution would take top spot c-ii issue solution push mirror hand limitation mirror set pushed one hand hand would move mirror move solution making mirror move patient head issue worsened fact mirror move time patient head changed direction may especially problematic trying look mirror hand keep moving away solution iii animate hand crossing evaluated mixed patient experience one major limitation object placed close center screen may hard interact due animation case limitation could avoided experience would positive solution make main hand invisible showing mirrored hand considered limitation since patient seeing hand actually moving solution making main hand non-interactive proposed compromise fully interactive fully invisible allows patient still see hand incentivized use mirror solution make hand interact would fix issue hand getting stuck mirror empty hand object carried one hand hand still interact object based evaluation result solution considered promising solution could applied alongside solution could used instead issue prevented use c-iii issue solution feedback strategy solution limit exercise area solution make main hand invisible limitation c-i iii apply solution make mirror hand highlighted doe introduce limitation give positive experience partially solves issue solution iii feedback head turned away mirror hand doe introduce new limitation could annoy patient solution highlight objective solves issue solution showing ghost hand giving example interaction used draw attention relevant location doe introduce new limitation solution limit exercise area could useful
