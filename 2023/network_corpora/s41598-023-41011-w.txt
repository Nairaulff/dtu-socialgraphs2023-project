population density basic unmet need different geographical unit found higher mortality population year specially first wave nevertheless research used updated data larger geographical unit comunas city buenos aire robust history data level comuna could expand analysis pre post pandemic era moreover created relatively simple index publicly available data province argentina make methodology
