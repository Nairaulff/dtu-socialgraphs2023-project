introduction leptospirosis worldwide neglected zoonotic disease caused pathogenic spirochete genus leptospira mainly interrogans higher prevalence tropical country waterborne disease transmitted rat urine outbreak occur rainy season disease mainly affect low-income population individual exposed contaminated animal environment farmer veterinarian sewage worker meat inspector rodent control worker military personnel leptospirosis major concern public health due high morbidity mortality rate estimated 1.03 million new case occur worldwide annually along 58,900 even death mostly among young adult male many case leptospirosis undiagnosed misdiagnosed tropical febrile illness concealing actual burden therefore world health organization considers leptospirosis important neglected tropical zoonosis due underestimated incidence high mortality median mortality recent review 10.05 range 0–33.3 patient manifest asymptomatic mild disease fever chill headache myalgia ocular cutaneous
