introduction severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars-cov-2 virus cause coronavirus disease covid-19 manifest acute infection heterogeneous wide spectrum respiratory non-respiratory related symptom severity symptom range mild severe even fatal fortunately patient fully recover nevertheless becoming increasingly evident substantial proportion people continues experience symptom several

nevertheless substantial proportion participant continues experience symptom week month positive sars-cov-2 pcr test accordance previous study performed patient mild severe covid-19 thus far unknown whether extent positive tested participant free symptom actual infection data pre covid-19 status longitudinal study scarce current study showed symptom already partly present infection implies persisting symptom may solely attributed sars-cov-2 infection accordance colleague found sample u.s. community experienced least one symptom already infection part ongoing symptom could explained pre-infection status therefore probably new-onset persisting symptom following sars-cov-2 infection another difficulty characterizing long-covid lack data participant negative sars-cov-2 test many symptom non-specific common general population may related another infection underlying chronic disease ageing change behaviour due pandemic indeed increase symptom burden also found participant negative sars-cov-2 pcr test compared though symptom loss sense smell taste fever remained equally prevalent accordance søraas colleague studied persistence symptom month sars-cov-2 positive negative test found especially symptom loss sense smell taste significantly frequently reported positive tested person compared negative day testing addition french population-based cohort comparing group according european center disease control ecdc criterion covid-19 ecdc ecdc– serological sars-cov-2 test result sero sero– found individual group similar risk least one symptom lasting month note result interpreted caution individual show sero-conversion sero-reconversion occurs time leading serological misclassification nevertheless finding together suggest persistent symptom also common general population may therefore directly related sars-cov-2 infection regard qol expected participant positive sars-cov-2 pcr test would experience lower level qol infection compared negative tested participant current finding however indicated qol level positive negative tested participant nearly returned pre-test value group level huang showed community-dwelling covid-19 survivor still lower health status one year infection non-covid-19 control nevertheless included participant study huang colleague previously hospitalized patient whereas proportion hospitalized participant current study small could explain difference experienced health status week month following infection limitation considered interpreting current finding first sars-cov-2 diagnosis severity based self-report without use medical record addition precise date covid-19 diagnosis unknown therefore precise duration symptom post-covid-19 also unknown second result generalized people covid-19 adolescent year age included current analysis moreover case severe sars-cov-2 likely participate current study hence small proportion hospitalized participant third participant negative sars-cov-2 pcr test considered healthy control since participant eligible pcr testing nevertheless reason testing e.g testing due covid-19 like symptom contact person covid-19 travel unknown addition sars-cov-2 serology test retrospective diagnosis covid-19 performed current study therefore undetected infection first month covid-19 pandemic completely ruled fourth participant one positive negative sars-cov-2 pcr test taken account hence result generalized people multiple period symptom could attributed infection fifth data concerning pre-existing comorbidities lacking effect pre-existing comorbidities symptom burden could determined sixth bmi assessed first visit general lifeline cohort study e.g recruitment period 2006–2013 therefore effect change bmi symptom severity i.e back pain shortness breath could evaluated seventh information available whether participant received vaccination course study protective effect vaccination long-covid unknown yet eight onset new covid-19 variant considered nevertheless current data approximately september july omicron presented europe late early last list symptom might all-inclusive people sars-cov-2 infection may experience different symptom including brain fog concentration problem fluctuating symptom like post-exertional malaise conclusion study contributes rapidly developing knowledge covid-19 long-term consequence finding indicate symptom positive sars-cov-2 test might attributable infection symptom also common participant negative sars-cov-2 pcr test nonetheless part ongoing symptom could explained pre-infection status new-onset persisting
