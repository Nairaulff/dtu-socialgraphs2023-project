plasma albumin blood rise first hour recovery result probable mechanism response albumin redistribution interstitial intravascular region increased lymph flow exercise may lead albumin redistribution addition within hour following exercise primary contributor increased lymph flow muscle pumping return normal nagashima study anticipated spike blood albumin following exercise would revert normal mean compensate study limitation first investigation study containing one consequently confirm outcome study totally attributed selected designed exercise program instruction given diet huge role play functioning liver therefore research involving another necessary verify interaction effect second small sample size healthy participant external validity current result increased research larger
