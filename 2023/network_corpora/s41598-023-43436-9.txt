introduction outbreak sars-cov-2 brought world standstill early due lack effective pharmaceutical intervention prompted world leader implement non-pharmaceutical measure manage transmission action profoundly impacted utilization provision healthcare service around globe addition population-wide lockdown country repurposed many health facility human resource tackle covid-19 devastating impact managing disease importance particularly tuberculosis disproportionately affected prevention care severely impacted wake covid-19 pandemic come achieving significant milestone reducing global burden area affected pandemic detection specifically number newly diagnosed case fell slightly recovered year though ideal outcome surprising since many diagnostic platform repurposed covid-19 testing facility shut given similarity clinical presentation covid-19 fear stigma prevented patient seeking care resulted patient presenting later health facility thus reducing testing consequently reduction detection particularly high-burden country increased incidence 3.6 south africa face dual burden hiv estimated new case coming living hiv given deadly nature opportunistic infection among people living hiv reduction detection dire consequence country nevertheless south african diagnostic service suffered similar fate rest world consequence covid-19 first lockdown test conducted using xpert mtb/rif ultra assay primary diagnostic tool south africa decreased january february number people screened positive test decreased 19.2 respectively compared pre-pandemic year study limpopo province recorded reduction number positive test initial lockdown therefore finding missed case rebuilding stronger diagnostic service top priority country much published literature detection south africa

diagnosis severely impacted pandemic recording decrease persisted end observation period result reported drastic decline detection indicator beginning pandemic similar reduction reported uganda slightly lower reduction experienced malawi 39.5 nigeria brazil 26.4 zambia reason decline similar namely mitigation measure placed restriction non-essential travel fear contracting virus also heightened period limited use health facility china certain ssa country case notification began rebound month follow malawi zambia even recording pre-pandemic number december september respectively increase either result effort respective government scale response activity relaxing covid-19 related restriction similarly study also found indicator began rebound substantially level five lockdown lifted even returning pre-pandemic level september country moved level lockdown demonstrates importance maintaining ease access healthcare service health crisis need corrective strategy area access compromised though extensive documentation pandemic effect detection study limited lockdown period study considered longitudinal impact pandemic important service indicator many study drawn premature conclusion based information available time instance south african study showing rapid improvement testing initial lockdown hypothesized quick recovery would negatively impact incidence future similarly world health organization reported case detection south africa similar pre-pandemic level however study reveals ethekwini diagnostic service particularly confirmation case encountered significant decline throughout pandemic suggesting specific region within country disproportionately affected expected confirmation case mirror pattern investigation given association unexpected reduction confirmed diagnosis may due underreporting underdiagnosis either possibility would negative implication disease surveillance transmission respectively study required understand caused continued reduction detection phcs covid-19 ethekwini since effect undetected mortality severe noticeable short term metric monitored determine whether true reduction diagnosed took place instead increase underreporting given reduction diagnosis exacerbated peak covid-19 testing capacity central laboratory may compromised time gene xpert mtb/rif machine repurposed covid-19 likewise staff resource phcs may overstretched time covid-19 surge leading underreporting facility level hypothesis would need confirmed qualitative study phcs laboratory health system capable providing quality care positive health outcome despite ongoing health crisis failure learn pandemic produce resilient health system addition identifying case may missed pandemic dire consequence management south africa study without limitation firstly data used dhis therefore subject human error manual capturing also possible error missing data may amplified stress brought pandemic help mitigate data inaccuracy clinic missing data outlier excluded analysis another limitation use single-group analysis design lack control group assumes existing confounders changing relatively slowly time would interfere analysis including comparable control group possible covid-19 impacted entire country however unlikely factor pandemic caused observed effect outcome given abrupt drastic change occurred simultaneously various stage covid-19 furthermore study investigated impact covid-19 diagnosis consider development drug resistance outcome also affected pandemic strength study use time series analysis best quasi-experimental design estimating effect exposure outcome randomization possible secondly using multiple exposure period provides robust illustration impact covid-19 detection assessing pattern diagnostic service phcs throughout covid-19 able determine longitudinal impact pandemic service investigation confirmed case negatively impacted level five lockdown however confirmed remained decline despite investigation rebounding pandemic continued cause reduction remain unclear need investigated strengthen diagnostics phcs currently future pandemic
