introduction doubt worldwide reduction natural habitat due human land use change land use intensification causing dramatic loss specie diversity across taxonomic group insect particularly affected human impact severe consequence ecosystem functioning change insect community term diversity biomass composition also entail change e.g food web dynamic thus pollination natural pest control pathogen damage decomposition counteract decline insect practice need developed help recover stabilize formerly degraded insect community increasing local plant diversity could strategy promote insect community plant diversity shown increase insect diversity abundance biomass trait diversity consequently insect-mediated ecosystem function addition increase food resource diversity increase number plant specie lead higher productivity altered habitat structure microclimatic condition factor potentially important enrichment insect community specifically due strong bottom effect increase plant resource diversity enhances attractiveness specialized herbivore also carnivore feeding similarly increased habitat complexity driven increase plant diversity benefit individual insect specie might affect specie directly indirectly connected however plant diversity contributes restoration insect community formed arable land use yet studied experimental context study habitat-insect relationship carabid ground beetle often play important role several reason first relatively abundant species-rich grassland arable field making suitable organism group comparative study second due sensitivity habitat structure microclimate carabid beetle often used bioindicator ass habitat quality third carabids play important role food web although number trophic specialization among generally considered polyphagous predator therefore affecting lower trophic level e.g herbivore decomposers associated ecosystem function role important e.g natural pest control arable land might strongly influence

change plant specie richness composition thus inevitably change vegetation structure addition plot higher plant specie richness might diverse structure allowing grassland specie coexist time inhibiting locomotive activity reproduction arable specie moment question whether plant diversity effect change time subject intensive investigation strengthening plant diversity effect time could reported plant related ecosystem function like productivity far insect community carabid community composition study strengthening plant specie richness effect indicate community assembly may take several year even mobile aboveground-feeding specie emphasizes importance long-term study delayed increasing response carabid community new environmental condition likely caused dispersal life-cycle larval stage mobile surprisingly first two period plot-specific turnover ground beetle assemblage higher plot higher plant specie richness last period plant specie richness decreased plot-specific turnover indicated two divergent effect taking place different development stage ecosystem firstly plant diversity increased turnover towards grassland community land use change community still adapting new habitat condition community turnover lower later ecosystem stage indicates high plant diversity stabilizes community assemblage community well adapted plant biomass production shown plant diversity stabilizes productivity thus likely stable plant production cascade higher trophic level addition diverse plant community provide stable habitat condition implication study confirms insect community changed tremendously land use change case ground beetle independent whether land use change considered towards natural condition intense anthropogenic influence ecosystem among carabid beetle contrast group e.g pollinator several specie adapted highly intensely managed land arable field arable specie first strongly decline likely vanish however arable land use assumed one major cause insect decline also need establish practice diminish insect decline help recover insect community suffering insect decline result clearly show carabid community constantly developed land use change beside strong temporal change community composition result also demonstrate plant specie richness positive effect transition carabid beetle assembly typical newly established grassland process community assembly starting biodiversity experiment field take considerable time largely neglected biodiversity experiment result caution short-term experimental study group depend natural community assembly manipulation habitat blake suggested carabid beetle recolonization process likely take considerably longer five year study line previous result however found plant diversity first accelerated transition carabid assemblage towards natural grassland community stabilized community assemblage thus high plant diversity accompanied low intense land management offer one hand strategy accelerated transition towards natural insect population hand many arable carabid specie need non-arable habitat reproduction overwintering thus grassland habitat high diversity providing stable environmental condition may therefore serve temporal refuge specie potentially contribute pest control spilling croplands
