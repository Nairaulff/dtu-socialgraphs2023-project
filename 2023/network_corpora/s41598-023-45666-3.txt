introduction central question concerning sexual ornament source reliability provides sufficient benefit chooser counterbalance cost considering signal plumage coloration well known target sexual selection typically categorized based proximate background individual difference pigment-based color get information content pigment quality quantity chromatic structural coloration typically uv-blue iridescent involves generation self-assembly ordered nanostructures may therefore gain information content precision structure contentious type coloration white plumage patch widespread many taxon repeatedly shown indicate aspect individual quality condition parasite load reproductive output patch contain neither pigment ordered nanostructure must gain reliability quantity quality reflective surface however information content reliability complicated plumage color doe seem static trait even though typically one maximum two molt performed year coloration shown change without feather replacement conspicuousness may increase typically decrease plumage color change molt may confound analysis signal information content function delimit informative period trait moreover partner seem respond color change within-season manipulation coloration breeding bird seem induce change parental investment partner color change may constitute signal condition quality social mate even neighbor however point confirmed yet study knowledge experimentally demonstrated information content within-season plumage color shift reason observed change partner investment would adaptive white plumage area lack feather-strengthening melanin disproportionately expose feather structure mechanical abrasion therefore potentially color degradation therefore white area reflectance ideal candidate dynamic

actual expression white wing patch reflectance shown correlate feather macrostructural state moreover reflectance suggested gain part quality-indicator value macrostructural state macrostructural state reflected previous year reproductive effort predicted current year reproductive success current study show manipulation effect either macrostructure result shown reflectance wing patch wing patch flight feather expected resistant wear degrade longer time scale contour feather context present result previous finding indicate information content wing patch concerning current reproductive potential due long-term aspect body condition possibly individual quality short-term condition fluctuation interesting addition signal value ornament patch size also informative functionally important sex reviewed ref second interesting point concerning result significantly affected area breast chroma male brightness female previously showed female compared plumage area breast brightness chroma low within-individual repeatability great time-proportional change expression incubation late nestling rearing particularly incubation suggested might extreme exposure area dirt abrasion parental duty moreover chroma implicated greater area-specific deterioration brightness population consequence mating pattern therefore deterioration breast chroma male manipulated reproductive effort surprising female breast chroma also show non-significant tendency direction 0.133 hand female breast brightness significantly responded manipulation homologous male trait 0.685 female breast feather much reflective late nestling period male feather could feather macrostructure differs sex male feather also resistant wear note female breast also contains melanin confounds reflectance degradation complicated explanation female incubate offspring day age thereby exposing far greater amount dirt wear male therefore brightness degradation-prone trait chroma female sex predominately expect degradation finally interesting breast reflectance trait showed smallest overall decline among white plumage area nestling rearing yet effect reproductive effort visible breast may bird easily reach breast plumage cleaning ordering time parental care duty may leave visible trace breast despite abundant correlative evidence short-term degradation plumage color little attention paid possible role trait type dynamic signal although important multiple reason first manipulation reproductive effort induce change coloration next molt standard though rarely used test condition dependence three study aware two measured current-year color patch size bird nestling rearing therefore related abrasion whereas one study used generalized across-season patch size measure manipulation aimed test condition-dependence color molt may inadvertently alter current color time measurement due degradation therefore confound baseline future ornamentation compared could blur distort effect manipulation apparent color change measurement current color need carefully timed future application classical method especially abrasion-prone trait involved second coloration breeding bird often measured much investment breeding bout already second half nestling rearing color degradation may influence assessment mating success consequence therefore fitness relevance color effect indeed detected coloration population therefore would important widely quantify degree plumage color degradation nestling rearing effect mating pattern success correlation third consequence effort-dependent rapid degradation suggest substantial complication causal relation coloration success reproductive output may determined dynamic balance parental investment partner investment may depend partner ornamentation partner
