introduction half century since rakoff observed problem intergenerational trauma among descendant holocaust survivor experience holocaust directly secondarily traumatized parental traumatic history related negative emotional atmosphere family origin specifically numerous subsequent study found holocaust offspring increased risk mental health problem predominantly posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd depression anxiety well heightened prevalence health problem like cancer heart disease chronic pain study second-generation holocaust survivor started new interdisciplinary line research focused whether consequence surviving trauma may transmitted one generation another review see term transmission trauma defined various way originally understood process passing specific trauma-related thought feeling behavior trauma survivor offspring process observed case holocaust trauma also among child war veteran family refugee even family one parent exposed childhood maltreatment abuse various mechanism trauma transmission process suggested including psychodynamic explanation vicarious trauma model learning modeling parenting family environment influence even biological hypothesis although literature intergenerational trauma massive still expanding review meta-analyses see topic remains rife controversy unanswered important research question first little knowledge trauma
