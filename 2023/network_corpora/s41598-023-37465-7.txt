introduction cervical myelopathy characterized stenosis cervical spine may result gait disturbance hand clumsiness patient often unaware condition due slow progression symptom therefore time symptom manifest patient seek treatment often progress severe stage patient advanced often report unstable gait prone fall lead spinal cord injury spine fracture though symptom improve early treatment reported advanced stage may irreversible likely resulting poor treatment outcome thus early detection treatment desirable symptom often begin upper extremity clumsiness hand known myelopathic hand myelopathic hand characterized loss manual dexterity may lead patient struggling write button early detection requires physical examination experienced doctor use objective evaluation method 10-s grip release test finger escape sign however established objective evaluation parameter symptom involving activity daily living difficulty writing buttoning recently focused writing behavior patient various disease cause writing disorder developed novel screening tool using machine learning identify carpal tunnel syndrome method allowed screening carpal tunnel syndrome analyzing change drawing pressure trajectory accuracy resulting sensory disturbance atrophy thenar muscle present study applied previous method writing disorder related developed classification method method intended used develop basic tool comprised commercially available tablet stylus pen screening outside hospital setting best knowledge previous report tool using artificial intelligence screen objectively analyzing

alzheimer disease focusing feature related speed handwritten signature also several report method detect dysgraphia child tablet-based diagnostic tool developed predict dysgraphia focusing static kinematic pressure tilt feature writing behavior however best knowledge study reported method use machine learning diagnose writing disorder study first report simple screening method based drawing task using machine learning intrinsic hand muscle function decreased distinct spasticity hand may lead clumsiness thus clinically plausible average drawing pressure lower overall term drawing pressure smoothness indicated spectral arc length sparc value spiral wave significantly lower group non-cm group indicating smoothness also reasonable finding hand group greater value square triangular wave spiral meaning writing pressure smoother shape however sparc value square triangular wave significantly different group reason could two figure composed several short line short pause middle making difficult distinguish smoothness compared spiral written continuously longer period time meanwhile significant difference observed drawing time shape participant asked write preferred speed instruction fast write therefore regardless group wrote quickly others wrote carefully slowly different result might observed instructed write quickly possible future study needed verify svm classification model high accuracy observed model triangular wave may triangular wave tip stylus need turned back opposite direction difficult patient poorer hand control addition previous report investigating writing angle found right-hander biomechanical property among hand muscle favor right ascending line hinder right descending line study also reported difference speed line length

pronounced patient possibly increasing accuracy distinguishing non-cm method presented report requires special equipment commercially available tablet device stylus pen implemented hospital setting also out-of-hospital setting home although cross-sectional study pre-diagnosed patient prospective study needed method may lead technique early detection prompting patient visit spine specialist confirm diagnosis receive early treatment several approach early detection outside hospital setting example web-based symptom checker widely used diagnostic tool however tool limited ability accurately diagnose mild symptom optimization needed previous study reported system diagnose using non-contact sensor device artificial intelligence analyze hand grip release may lead early detection outside hospital setting study novel objectively analyzed writing behavior common activity daily living currently necessary use specific shape future method could applied using unspecified shape writing one name could lead development method allows unconscious screening daily life study limitation first analyze disease affect writing movement carpal tunnel syndrome cubital tunnel syndrome parkinson disease already developed classification method carpal tunnel syndrome plan classify multiple disease future work second participant group pre-operative patient causing concern would higher proportion severe case however fact case graded mild moderate using japanese orthopedic association joa scoring system included suggests method could still adapted use screening tool third limit level spinal cord compression perform level-by-level comparative verification main purpose method screening correlation level stenosis degree impairment writing movement need studied separately fourth method doe sufficient sensitivity used screening tool although higher conventional physical examination higher sensitivity accuracy needed use outside hospital everyday life however strength model updated sequentially adding case aim bring model closer implementation accuracy improves future example addition feature related sensation strength potential increase model accuracy added analysis number sample increase future conclusion developed novel classification method provides basis screening system using machine learning algorithm-based analysis drawing behavior integrating feature related drawing behavior obtained model high classification accuracy using commercially available tablet device stylus pen method could used development disease screening system in- out-of-hospital
