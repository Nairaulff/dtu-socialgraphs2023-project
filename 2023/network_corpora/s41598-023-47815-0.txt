minutus intruder fight decreased encounter larger opponent randomly-chosen contest experienced recent defeat similar-sized contest first study show pagurus hermit crab intruder use four type information decide whether give male–male contest confirm intruder use information recent defeat regardless experimental method decreased aggression loser referred loser effect many animal show loser effect competing naïve opponent one explanation loser decrease self-assessment rhp relative others although yasuda koga suggest minutus ass rhp relative opponent escalation male–male contest greater giving-up frequency trial group indicates also ass rhp escalation least losing since intruder persistence escalation change even losing loser effect might based perceived actual rhp although fighting behavior rapping shell fight hermit crab carry cost depletion energy reserve contest duration trial affect giving-up decision trial group supplementary fig pagurus male injured male–male contest thus one contest might affect actual rhp via depletion energy reserve context whereas intruder middendorffii ignore past defeat next contest intruder minutus used information decide whether avoid contest yasuda koga pointed possibility minutus sensitive fighting cost middendorffii suggest minutus may potential mating opportunity middendorffii minutus longer reproductive period middendorffii minutus multiple oviposition animal showing loser effect avoid even smaller opponent suggesting might important loser minimize fighting cost would engage even fight high probability winning loser effect minutus might also contribute cost avoidance support cost sensitivity specie minutus loser maintain actual rhp contest analysis group vs. group suggests intruder specie gain information opponent previous win escalation found difference giving-up frequency escalation group fig loser decision give might independent opponent prior win pre-escalation phase escalation however significant trial group interaction detected intruder retreated sooner prior winner naïve opponent fig one possible explanation loser could detect opponent cue prior win crustacean even escalation minutus use information escalation rather escalation like middendorffii remains explored another possible explanation opponent actual rhp increased prior win via improved motivation fighting skill hand since contest duration trial shorter group two group interaction might also caused unexpected value determine relative importance opponent cue indicating prior win opponent enhanced rhp loser decision direct investigation i.e. random-sized contest naïve intruder guarding male prior win needed greater giving-up frequency trial group group fig suggests minutus intruder used previously established dominance hierarchy avoid familiar dominant opponent pagurus minutus could therefore second specie pagurus hermit crab show familiar recognition male–male contest middendorffi interspecific difference loser effect suggest male two specie might different sensitivity cost fighting potential mating opportunity nevertheless since intruder specie avoid escalation familiar dominant individual established hierarchy provide reliable information subsequent decreased chance success since opponent recognition also reported context pagurus specie bernhardus longicarpus cognitive ability might widely shared group recent study indicate information use flexible within among specie example contestant rely different information rhp based contest phase positioning prior contest experience minutus intruder use mainly mutual-assessment rhp make giving-up decision also re-assess rhp losing information opponent prior win might affect different contest phase based familiarity opponent pagurus minutus therefore provides additional example flexibility information use information use also vary among closely related specie according interspecific difference sociality habitat choice response predation reproductive characteristic social cognition active field study investigation invertebrate limited therefore investigation taxonomically diverse organism required
