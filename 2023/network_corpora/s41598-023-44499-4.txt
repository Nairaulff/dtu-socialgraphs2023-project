introduction irregular sleep pattern systemic well-being quality sleep become popular topic modern era along development technology diversification occupation people longer devoted traditional life cycle sleeping night working daytime freed standardized form life growing knowledge discordance day/night cycle one sleep pattern affect adversely various biological function human body may even affect one life expectancy irregular shifted sleep cycle found associated higher risk type diabetes weight gain coronary heart disease stroke cancer shift work related sleep disorder shift work refers type work performed outside regular daytime hour i.e. 09:00–18:00 occupation engaging 24-h restaurant convenience store hospital delivery work field closely related shift work shift worker may need alteration original sleep pattern order comply shift work schedule lead various systemic illness developed among shift worker biological harm primarily explained circadian rhythmicity inherent every organ system body circadian disruption occurred atypical sleep pattern metabolism and/or immunologic system function properly leading aggravation pre-existing systemic disease like non-communicable chronic disease secondly proven people irregular sleep schedule suffer chronic sleep disturbance due either shorter longer low-quality sleep even showing disorder called shift work sleep disorder swsd severe case swsd found related multiple disease including type diabetes cardiovascular disease various form cancer periodontitis shift work sleep disorder periodontitis inflammatory disease occurring oral cavity receiving attention wide range medical department strong mutual influence found periodontitis various non-communicable chronic disease ncds given demonstrated detrimental effect shift work systemic disease relatedness periodontitis disease reasonable assumption shift work related sleep disorder may also affect one periodontal status context group demonstrated recent article risk periodontitis significantly increased among subject engaged shift work finding irrespective sleep duration practicing occupational work outside daytime period 09:00–18:00 whether regular irregular increase odds ratio periodontal disease among korean adult population aim study therefore next question specific type occupation mostly affected shift work term periodontal health called white-collar

worker tend spend working hour front computer screen overly exposed blue light since blue-light creates significant disturbance circadian rhythm combination shift work blue-light even harmful one white-collar job well known shift work hospital nurse work strictly engaged shift schedule weakened immunity poor physical condition along working condition reported however exact mechanism white-collar worker vulnerable shift work still ambiguous matter research nevertheless strength result first study consider interaction effect occupational type shift working pattern given close relationship periodontal disease systemic well-being result may offer new perspective future research regarding shift work chronic disease limitation study include cross-sectional nature possible underestimation participant periodontal status due cpi system use self-recorded questionnaire addition several significant data missing due nature national surveillance data factor like sleep quality exact duration occupational engagement oral hygiene status may strengthen weight result therefore longitudinal study detailed data required order confirm correlation periodontal disease effect occupational shift work also future research categorization occupation could different manner white- blue- pink-collar service sale worker concrete result within limitation study effect shift work seems particularly noticeable white-collar worker compared blue-collar worker result study suggests 24/7 lifestyle modern society pose health risk relevant people potential harm greater white-collar
