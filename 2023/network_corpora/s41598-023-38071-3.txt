introduction youth female athlete considered population sensitive present health issue compared counterpart could caused inadequate energy consumption eating behavior presence low energy availability lea female youth athlete result delay puberty menstrual irregularity development harmful eating behavior loss muscle mass impairment physical capacity risk lea found athlete restrict energy intake expending high amount energy exercise and/or limiting food choice pathologic eating behavior recently named orthorexia nervosa could associated risk lea orthorexia nervosa interpreted pathological fixation healthy nutrition concept introduced yet recognized eating disorder organization address aforementioned health issue international olympic committee attribute concept relative energy deficiency red-s caused chronically poor energy availability nutrition similarly female triad add lea menstrual dysfunction low bone mineral density despite literature describing aesthetic weight-dependent sport likely present component involved red-s female triad study also reported presence menstrual irregularity negative eating attitude lea professional female soccer player soccer far one popular sport played however regardless increased number participant modality information needed health issue especially among female youth description menstrual cycle status energy availability eating behavior still need outlined youth player well interrelation variable physical performance therefore aim study describe menstrual status perception risk lea presence orthorexia nervosa youth female player cypriot soccer team additionally comparison correlation low energy availability orthorexia nervosa physical performance tested respectively hypothesized interrelationship among negative menstrual status low energy availability poor eating behavior may affect negatively physical performance therefore player risk lea present menstrual irregularity higher score orthorexia nervosa significant reduction physical performance compared risk method participant nineteen youth female soccer player belonging team volunteered participate study mean age,14.6 1.42 year height 50.9

physical performance full size table discussion main aim study describe parameter related menstrual cycle status eating behavior low energy availability physical performance youth female soccer player main finding highlighted player perceived menstrual period affect performance game 66.7 however majority communicate coach menstrual cycle 83.3 prevalence risk lea 26.3 iii player risk lea also presented higher score orthorexia nervosa neither risk lea high score seems impair significantly player performance pre-season fig figure summary main finding full size image regarding menstrual cycle perception previous study demonstrated professional athlete perceived menstruation negatively impacted performance competition similarly youth player study described menstruation affecting performance game 66.7 thus considering event may change player performance could important coach aware reported elsewhere athlete seem open talking menstrual cycle female support staff interestingly present study even female head coach female strength conditioning coach majority player reported talking menstrual cycle 83.3 instead prefer talk teammate 77.8 strategy focused communication coach team staff youth player reinforced order advise support player especially day menstruation competition recently described prevalence menstrual irregularity soccer player vary could result higher training hour insufficient recovery poor nutrition youth player study reported menarche year seemed affected training demand reinforced majority player reporting regular menstrual cycle however study found 26.3 player presented risk lea leaf-q questionnaire study evaluated lea female soccer player adult population reported mid-season energy availability declined player well heavy training match day reinforces importance following youth soccer player throughout season order monitor lea response act reverse minimize negative status previously described lea associated poor eating behavior indeed current study youth player risk lea also presented high score outcome significant clear large effect 1.25 moreover 44.4 player trained presented risk lea significant association recent eating behavior known prevalence youth athlete recently reported higher value presented athlete well non-athletes present study first describe value youth female soccer player nonetheless previous study evaluate lea eating attitude professional soccer athlete found negative eating attitude observed athlete lea compared higher energy availability despite significant effect lea presence seems affect soccer player physical performance potential impact lea performance could occur due impairment physiological parameter function e.g. circulatory lactate reduction fat-free mass electrolyte abnormality dehydration date first study describes lea physical performance youth soccer player need pointed even significant difference group risk lea low risk player risk presented lower result jump cardiorespiratory test moderate large effect respectively unclear study female junior swimmer demonstrated week competitive season athlete presented energy deficit associated ovarian suppression decline 9.8 sport performance 400-m time trial swim test compared athlete normal cycling presented improvement 8.2 long-term monitoring lea physical performance youth soccer player suggested order identify chronic lea affect physical performance first study described associated menstrual cycle status lea physical performance limitation highlighted evaluation one team might reflect something youth soccer player larger sample could also increase statistical power significant effect could found lea physical performance large sample considering effect jump cardiorespiratory test player risk lea player strong clear secondly study evaluated player one period pre-season deep inference possible monitoring variable throughout whole season also long-term could result different outcome lea well association physical performance conclusion conclusion study demonstrated majority youth player soccer team presented normal menstrual cycle perceiving effect performance game communication coach also 26.3 presented risk lea together significantly higher value compared non-risk lea however even risk lea high value physical performance significantly affected although study first describe topic current data provides snapshot assessment youth soccer player thus may represent long-term lea therefore possibility player altered response throughout season overlooked
