introduction artificial intelligence-related technology grow rapid pace interest research human-centered artificial intelligence focus human increasing easiest field experience artificial intelligence technology everyday life conversational artificial intelligence chatbots past considered difficult impossible outperform human-level gold standard natural language-related task advent pre-trained language model bert gpt research active result exceeded gold standard natural language-related benchmark due achievement various study also conducted field conversational artificial intelligence conversation one important aspect active member society conversation learn lot knowledge exchange emotion therefore conversation human utterance contains information also various emotion content evokes emotion may appear utterance conversational artificial intelligence achieve human-level artificial intelligence necessary identify emotion appear directly indirectly utterance generate emotion-based answer accordingly time recognizing factor emotion important help generate emotion-based answer however existing emotion dataset emotion-based conversation dataset concentrated classifying emotion text speech addition since emotional conversation system based existing datasets research finding utilizing factor emotion insufficient particular case korean emotion classification datasets limited category emotion mainly biased toward negative emotion datasets emotion factor emotion annotated paper propose korean emotion-factor dataset kemofact emotion factor tagged korean conversation also propose model baseline dataset express emotion-factor rather emotion-cause find annotate cause target emotion factor related emotion recently conversational artificial intelligence research using korean become active various datasets released however dataset find emotion factor emotion contribute study korean-based conversational artificial intelligence opening kemofact dataset public construct kemofact dataset using train set existing publicly available empathicdialogues datasets translate korean annotate phrase cause target given emotion related emotion based new dataset implement baseline model korean emotion-factor extraction task find corresponding factor emotion conversation given input however emotion-factor extraction task disadvantage requiring emotional annotation even testing limiting applicability model therefore based task also implement emotion-factor pair extraction task proposed dataset kemofact task find emotion factor together conversation pair two task implemented applying korean pre-trained language model experiment result compared analyzed paper major contribution follows build provide kemofact dataset korean emotionfactor dataset containing korean text emotion factor include cause target emotion provide baseline model allow inferring factor given emotion emotion-factor pair korean conversation applying pre-trained language model kemofact datasets contribute research field korean-based conversational artificial intelligence providing sufficient analysis kemofact dataset baseline model related work ece ecpe task order implement conversational human level emotion-based conversation must continued cause emotion must found used create conversation therefore emotion-cause extraction ece task find cause emotion given studied important task field natural language processing accordingly based deep learning method effectively extracting cause method multi-kernel svm question-answering lstm svm joint-learning co-attention rnn-transformer hierarchical network studied however ece task limit applicability model limitation emotion annotation required even testing therefore application emotion-cause pair extraction ecpe task extract pair emotion cause without emotion annotation required accordingly study ecpe task conducted multi-task learning transition-based directed graph construction inter-cause modeling etc based extracted emotion-cause relationship potentially important information obtained based empathetic dialog modeling used agent blender-bot persona datasets emotion however number open datasets tagging cause emotion along type emotion quite small korean using empatheticdialogues emotional dataset composed large-scale conversation released attempt recently made ecpe task releasing emocause dataset annotating emotional cause since emocause conducted using validation test set among empatheticdialogues dataset number data quite small due complexity annotation process size published datasets ecpe usually small addition cause several existing datasets mainly biased toward target cause emotion therefore necessary deal factor aroused emotion wider category also since emocause dataset english label type composed word several problem performing ecpe korean based dataset english unit spacing word korean unit spacing clause general one word form one clause sometimes postposition attached substantive suffix attached stem construct clause addition since linguistic feature english korean different word order impossible apply ecpe task simple translation work therefore paper propose kemofact emotion-factor dataset customized korean approximately 16.5k data using train set among empatheticdialogues dataset method task description conversation people exchange information emotion embedded together smooth conversation necessary understand emotion called overall atmosphere furthermore necessary able identify factor caused emotion among various information therefore important task conversational identify factor caused along emotion achieve human-level accordingly several study emotion-cause extraction emotion-cause pair extraction conducted however factor aroused emotion extracted several study confused word cause factor emotional cause extracted study biased toward object person thing caused emotion however object also various thing specific situation cause order evoke emotion therefore factor emotion may simply represented one word phrase entire sentence may factor emotion word seen factor recognized wider category cause covered comprehensively proposed task use term factor rather cause clarity define meaning cause factor defined cambridge dictionary table many factor make cause single cause responsible emotion rather multiple factor impact emotion therefore want focus many factor lead emotion rather single cause table definition emotion factor full size table finally define name dataset propose kemofact korean emotion-factor dataset extend ece task define emotion-factor extraction efe task furthermore task extract emotion cause pair conversation without given emotional annotation defined emotion-factor pair extraction efpe task kemofact dataset propose dataset kemofact factor emotion annotated korean text could infer factor emotion emotion korean utterance section summarizes data utilized build kemofact dataset annotation conducted finally analysis result dataset data collection paper utilize empathicdialogues dataset released facebook research help dialog agent understand emotion human learn provide appropriate conversation emotion dataset open-domain conversation allows conversation various topic speaker listener one-on-one conversation speaker start conversation overall situation feeling listener provides response considering person feeling expressing empathy exchanging six turn consists total 25k conversation conversation contains one specific emotion among emotion except neutrality emotion evenly distributed allowing detailed emotion classification conversation dataset thus generating conversation express emotion therefore order proceed efe efpe task korean intend construct kemofact dataset annotating factor emotion using prompt likely contain emotional factor general conversation represents overall situation conversation corresponding emotion column empatheticdialogues dataset data annotation annotation task largely divided two stage first translate conversation data emotion label empathicdialogues english korean next annotate factor
