introduction better understand dynamic malaria transmission identification blood meal source anopheles vector essential ass risk human exposure described anopheles specie responsible majority malaria case region occur gambiae arabiensis coluzzii funestus prevalent involved malaria transmission therefore considered main vector malaria sub-saharan africa considered long time highly anthropophilic endophilic specie several recent paper highlighted zoophilic tendency following implementation vector control strategy furthermore known crepuscular nocturnal biting activity switch biting behaviour demonstrated time place human protected thus determining trophic preference vector human blood index important understanding biting behaviour especially area additional strategy targeting residual transmission needed achieve pre-elimination progress towards elimination given effort resource deployed although bionomic behavioral study support development intervention strategy targeting vector evade standard control measure parameter need considered first regardless vector host selection result combined effect intrinsic preference modulated extrinsic factor even specie intrinsic preference

previous finding area doucoure thiaw dielmo sokhna ndiop village relatively higher number resting blood fed female collected human dwelling could related endophilic behaviour finding support study fornadel norris also demonstrated endophilic behaviour anopheles malaria vector recent study mbewe malawi also similarly demonstrated endophilic behaviour gambiae s.l funestus analysis blood meal

massebo ethiopia finney madagascar demonstrated zoophagic feeding behaviour anopheles mosquito observation suggest majority anopheles collected indoors present study took blood meal outdoors entrered room complete trophogonic cycle exophagic endophilic behaviour anopheles mosquito observed study previously described sougoufara dielmo thus among type blood meal identified including human large proportion likely taken outdoors outdoor biting behaviour therefore pose significant threat elimination effort sustain malaria transmission even area high control coverage measure village zoophagic behaviour vector could attributed good coverage use bed net protective measure zoophagic behaviour contrast finding konate showed majority blood meal gambiae funestus human indicating highly anthropophilic nature specie however current behaviour specie changed considerably result implementation many control strategy indeed study wotodjo doucoure showed number malaria case decreased introduction long-lasting insecticidal-treated net llins result obtained sougoufara also showed use llins correlated significant reduction mosquito biting rate thereby reducing disease transmission due inaccessibility human vector become opportunistic feed mainly animal phenomenon interesting village human host prevalent animal host especially bovine ovine equine chicken confirmed result selection ratio study showed variation different specie within village regardless location specie bovine significantly over-selected arabiensis coluzzii funestus considered opportunistic over-selected bovine lesser extent equine host number factor process influence mosquito host selection host availability density accessibility therefore keeping people animal together house considered effective strategy malaria control indeed mosquito access human may resort animal ensure survival addition study shown high density cattle around household still provides protection human especially mosquito enter house feed human blood meal observed rufipes coustani strictly zoophilic behaviour rufipes observed study previously reported konate despite presence human host result suggest senegal rufipes may involved malaria transmission contrast study conducted cameroon tabue recent study southeastern zambia saili reported involvement specie vector human plasmodium mixed blood meal common combination bovine equine although chicken common potential domestic host village blood meal taken host ndiop one blood meal recorded funestus dielmo result suggest vector feed chicken despite high density village observation made previously area konate wider distribution bovine blood meal attributed abundance host fact nearly household visited bovine kept inside house thus due number size behaviour bovine considered accessible host mosquito result spatio-temporal analysis hbi using spatial autocorrelation revealed regardless month negative spatial autocorrelation hbi observed village however household exhibited significantly higher score indicating higher frequency hbi others highlight unequal vulnerability individual malaria mosquito bite despite control measure factor may explain situation include tendency people spend time outdoors use bed net irregularly could considered risk factor malaria transmission additionally protective effect llins reduced individual receive mosquito

main malaria vector gambiae s.l funestus well strictly zoophagic behaviour rufipes despite presence human host detection human blood vector specie suggests potential malaria transmission two community furthermore study indicated presence domestic animal near human settlement combined use llins could integrated malaria vector control strategy nevertheless additional research required investigate relationship observed zoophagy potential infection vector plasmodium parasite provide comprehensive understanding residual transmission furthermore investigating feeding host profile outdoor resting population studying presence domestic animal may influence malaria epidemiology necessary tailor effective malaria control strategy
