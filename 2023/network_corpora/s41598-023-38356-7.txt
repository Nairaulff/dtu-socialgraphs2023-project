introduction gastric cancer remains one life-threatening disease causing million death annually worldwide gastric cancer approximately 90–95 adenocarcinoma gastric adenocarcinoma gac spread endoscopic technology gac often detected early stage endoscopic treatment widely available providing result comparable surgery maintaining patient quality life preserving stomach however gastric cancer recurs 5.2–14 patient endoscopic treatment major clinical problem main cause gac mucosal damage caused chronic infection helicobacter pylorus pylorus found approximately gastric cancer case eradication pylorus reduces risk gastric carcinogenesis prevents recurrence patient endoscopic resection thus endoscopic resection endoscopic submucosal dissection endoscopic mucosal resection eradication pylorus generally performed patient early gac pylorus infection however many case recurrence even eradication pylorus endoscopic treatment gastric cancer metachronous recurrence gac occur even curative endoscopic resection early gac performed eradication pylorus successful therefore even curative endoscopic resection early gac eradication pylorus almost patient undergo regular post-treatment follow-up cause patient incur large expense contribution social cost also need considered therefore risk factor pylorus eradication identified preventative method developed general risk gastric carcinogenesis includes degree endoscopic atrophy gastric mucosa presence extent intestinal metaplasia also true patient pylorus eradication endoscopic treatment early gac however mechanism phenomenon
