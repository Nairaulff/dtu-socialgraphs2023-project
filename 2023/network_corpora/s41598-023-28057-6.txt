stage 2-cell embryo one study pig wright found mir-21 level increased 25-fold oocyte maturation regulated meiotic maturation gilchrist indicated mir-21 level increased oocyte progressed mii stage meiosis domestic laboratory animal agreement study result demonstrated maturation oocyte increased increasing mir-21 concentration could concluded mir-21 play crucial role oocyte maturation correlation mir-21 expression oocyte maturation supported opinion inhibition mir-21 expression using mir-21 antisense oligonucleotides affect expression programmed cell death protein consequently suppresses oocyte maturation embryo development cleavage stage mechanism explaining mir-21 synthesized cell affect oocyte development different possibility may responsible result study evidence survival essential oocyte viability mir-21 may impact oocyte viability suppressing gene promote apoptosis found treatment inhibitor mir-21 increased apoptosis mechanism mediated rise pten expression gene known inhibit akt-dependent survival pathway pten cause apoptosis inhibiting pi3/akt kinase survival pathway therefore increased mir-21 level would probably reduce pten level increase akt activity maintain viability next part study focused evaluation embryo development difference number embryo obtained a-grade embryo case group versus control group furthermore mir-21 expression correlated embryo quality third day development finding consistent obtained uhde indicated similar expression mirna pattern bovine cleave became blastocyst concluded whole mirna expression including mir-21 could used quality marker inconsistent result dehghan proposed mir-21 increased zygote growth embryo development mouse inhibition mir-21 mir-off result reduced blastocyst formation altering gene expression cdk2ap1 oct4 furthermore bartolucci found significantly higher level mir-21 associated oocyte became blastocyst compared arrested cleavage stage patient difference result attributed difference human animal moreover factor influence embryo development sperm quality factor influencing embryo development according finding expression mir-21 increased serum subfertile woman interestingly mir-21 expression correlated positively mirnas synthesized cell like mural granulosa cell mir-21 transported oocyte via extracellular vesicle connection oocyte broken ovulation extracellular matrix gap junction enable communication oocyte gap junction facilitate transfer molecule oocyte regulate folliculogenesis demonstrated transfer mir-21 occurs oocyte vitro maturation since rna transcription suppressed oocyte maturation mir-21 level correlate synthesis oocyte presence mirnas membrane-bound microvesicles exosomes soluble form well established characteristic mirna expression highly stable accumulate development follicle expression level mirnas reflects overall alternation diseased condition hence mirna profile exhibit disparity according result study mir-21
