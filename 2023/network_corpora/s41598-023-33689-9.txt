introduction lifestyle change occur beginning throughout university study added demand higher education require young adult ability adapt challenge academic life period student exposed high pressure lack time need adapt rule established institution low social support change familiar environment another often unknown one adaptation new social circle consequence daily demand intense strenuous influencing academic performance health university student population group proportion individual poor sleep quality identified according pittsburgh sleep quality index psqi score greater point particularly high reaching proportion 62.0 87.1 importantly psqi subjective sleep assessment method high proportion might affected least part reporting bias however thus far possible consider proportion overestimated agreement subjective objective i.e. actigraphy polysomnography sleep measure population still unclear addition large-scale epidemiological study university student various field knowledge used objective sleep measurement addition harmful implication sleep disorder health condition excess weight chronic musculoskeletal pain high blood pressure potential relationship mental health condition deserves special attention university student depression anxiety stress low quality life suicidal ideation attempt lower academic performance among possible strategy reduce prevalence sleep disorder attenuate consequence free-time physical activity ftpa i.e. form physical exercise movement performed leisure time outside work obligation nonpharmacological alternative shown beneficial effect consistently observed physically inactive student likely poor sleep quality given change student lifestyle academic life necessary understand relationship physical activity sleep stage life although physical activity regardless domain particularly relevant practice performed free time shown substantial benefit addition understanding relationship may help establish behavioral intervention within university environment providing better quality sleep consequently better quality life general health therefore study aimed analyze relationship practice ftpa sleep

canadian university student author claimed moderate level physical activity predicted sleep quality indirectly emotion control time contrast cross-sectional study university student reported exercise

methodological consideration made correct interpretation result cross-sectional design research doe allow establish causal relationship practicing physical activity free time improving sleep quality however previous evidence support direction association attributing physical activity predictive effect better sleep quality although sedentary behavior associated variable interest information behavior available present study although accelerometer pedometer used objective measure ass practice questionnaire commonly employed epidemiological study however another limitation information ftpa limited weekly frequency type intensity time dedicated physical activity specified inferred student practice 4–7 times/week necessarily active practice 1–3 times/week addition high proportion poor

obtained interviewee self-report thus accuracy result may affected recall bias finally large sample size allowed controlling potential confounders social support depressive symptom residual confounding possible due variable available analyzed dataset sport practice use sleep-related supplement e.g. melatonin chronic pain stress disease health condition result study suggest practice ftpa
