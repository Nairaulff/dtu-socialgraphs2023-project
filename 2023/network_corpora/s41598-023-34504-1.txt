introduction world health organization declared covid-19 pandemic march illness diagnosed first time december wuhan china according statistic world health organization 635,962,174 confirmed case covid-19 6,613,086 death worldwide reaction unprecedented virus many country implemented extremely stringent epidemic prevention measure thus covid-19 greatly affected utilization expenditure health care service well incidence disease furthermore measure also influenced call dispatch international transmission covid-19 performance prehospital personnel people life expectancy people willingness seek medical treatment etc according research conducted scotland accident emergency visit emergency hospital admission decreased result covid-19 despite recovery visit rate remained prepandemic level another study conducted trauma center louisville found epidemic drastically reduced number emergency department visit return prepandemic level study conducted tehran iran revealed volume call dispatch increased due impact covid-19 however currently lack research long-term effect epidemic pre-hospital emergency system particularly major city southwestern region china prehospital emergency care vital component prehospital system also important measure overall medical service level addition clinical care personnel environment resource logistics impact prehospital emergency previous research shown covid-19 pandemic impact pre-hospital emergency system study reporting decrease emergency department visit certain country others found increase call dispatch .this indicates difference epidemic prevention policy public awareness epidemic pre-hospital model could potentially affect utilization pre-hospital emergency service context recurrent outbreak public health emergency crucial relevant department develop emergency plan coordinate medical resource guide people seek medical treatment correctly prevent deterioration patient illness might cause serious consequence drawing lesson past event provide foundation establishing advanced superior urban emergency medical service system therefore purpose study determine covid-19 pandemic altered epidemiological characteristic prehospital emergency service megacity population million people result final total 1,122,294 record included study figure show number demand comparison demand grew steadily pandemic declined substantially

outbreak future research made retrospective descriptive study explored change epidemiological characteristic prehospital emergency service measure effect covid-19 city proper chengdu result showed although large-scale epidemic chengdu people medical behavior willingness still affected demand prehospital prehospital emergency command dispatch ert disease spectrum changed influence epidemic although postepidemic normalization period began relevant observed prehospital emergency indicator still different pandemic result showed decline prehospital emergency demand covid-19 outbreak marked decline decrease explained fact people know virus afraid going hospital would increase chance infected could treated study pointed medical resource redistributed fight virus outbreak resulting decline ability solve medical problem outbreak turn led decline utilization health care service in-depth analysis found stricter epidemic prevention control policy lower number emergency call people made may strict policy restricted people going turn led reduction incidence accident traffic accident fight fall although demand increased yet return prepandemic level mean impact outbreak first aid prolonged addition also found increase ert outbreak began reduced pre-epidemic level change may due limitation imposed lockdown restriction moreover since novel coronavirus general public medical staff knew little resulting many protective measure time admission may also one reason prolongation ert divergent result study compared similar study may attributed organizational disparity public access acute healthcare additionally absence large-scale epidemic research period could also contributing factor could mainly attributed prompt implementation strict epidemic prevention measure relevant department including comprehensive screening close contact large-scale nucleic acid testing infected individual identified furthermore country stringent quality control indicator pre-hospital emergency medical service chengdu government mandate every emergency medical hospital must depart accident site within five minute receiving emergency call thus doctor nurse take measure minimize time spent wearing protective equipment study also suggested pandemic influenced ranking disease spectrum distribution visit month overall volume traffic accident decreased due serious strict safer-at-home lockdown policy implemented domestic epidemic addition reduce risk infection people willing stay home volume traffic accident increased may attributed easing outbreak restriction lifting lockdown policy return normalized management pandemic epidemic prevention control people needed stay home reduced exercise level irregular diet changed way life may resulted increase digestive system disease peak pandemic number visit cerebrovascular disease decreased reasonable patient transient/mild stroke symptom seek medical assistance often possibly fear contracting virus declining health care capacity however epidemic leveled number patient cerebrovascular disease increased substantially possibly due interruption regular follow-up visit failure take medicine time failure comply medical order worth noting outbreak demand first aid respiratory disease decreased compared pandemic may attributed fact early day covid-19 epidemic china completely carried social distancing personal hygiene masking measure finding consistent previous report showed substantial decline incidence respiratory disease country however study also indicated early stage outbreak number respiratory disease emergency call cumulative incidence rate higher pandemic different study may attributed longer research period conducted partly due fact various country yet entered strict control stage early stage pandemic addition due demand epidemic prevention control fear virus people willing delay avoid seeking medical service led find initial day peak distribution visit month disease delayed performing circular distribution analysis view understanding virus effectiveness epidemic prevention control policy people longer refuse medical treatment fear infected initial daily occurrence peak period disease returned normal even earlier finally outbreak affected people normal life resulting decline utilization medical resource also affected epidemiological distribution prehospital emergency resource therefore study suggests relevant department need find way minimize interference treatment prevention nonepidemic-related health problem develop plan return pre-epidemic level soon possible guide people seek medical treatment far know study first investigate local covid-19 epidemic uniquely affect pre-hospital emergency care southwest region china additionally study large sample size complete data advantage reduce statistical error improve result reliability authenticity however study also limitation first disease classified according certain system impact covid-19 epidemic certain disease could analyzed second study included one center resulting poor generalizability conclusion hope later multicenter study conducted would add weight conclusion third large-scale epidemic chengdu resulting impact outbreak prehospital first aid underestimated conclusion short epidemic profound impact prehospital emergency service particular prehospital emergency demand decreased considerably result come
