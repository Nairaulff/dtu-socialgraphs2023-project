introduction high-quality sleep important factor sustaining health improving well-being sleep quality defined individual self-satisfaction aspect sleep experience sleep disorder defined disturbance quality time sleep systematic review meta-analysis found better sleep quality favourably associated various health outcome cardiovascular disease metabolic syndrome mental health dementia however sleep disorder insomnia narcolepsy excessive sleepiness numerous adverse health effect prevalent general population worldwide example 50–70 million adult usa sleep disorder insomnia common disorder china pooled prevalence insomnia according meta-analysis study moreover gender difference sleep quality reported several study japan nationwide study found prevalence insomnia higher woman 14.6 relative men 12.2 previous study reported lifestyle habit healthy diet physical activity improve sleep quality physical activity beneficial effect sleep quality systematic review revealed moderate-intensity physical activity promotes adult sleep quality notably sedentary behaviour also linked sleep quality independent physical activity level defined waking behaviour characterised energy expenditure 1.5 metabolic equivalent mets sitting reclining posture systematic review meta-analysis found associated higher risk insomnia sleep disturbance another study using data six country found sedentary time associated higher odds sleep problem e.g. poorer sleep quality regardless physical activity intervention aimed increasing physical activity reducing may offer non-pharmacological strategy improving sleep quality nevertheless methodological constraint previous study examining association physical activity sedentary time sleep quality since total hour per day stable physical

similar previous study using accelerometer could measure physical activity involving upper lower limb without trunk movement water-based activity sleep quality measure past month recall whereas physical activity based single week sleep quality also self-reported prior study reported validity although assessed objectively convenient larger sample usually requires sleep study clinic sleep
