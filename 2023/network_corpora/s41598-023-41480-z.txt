magnetic resonance imaging mri computerized tomography physician visit medication medical innovation new preventive technology diagnostic innovation outpatient surgical procedure according roemer law excess hospital bed lead overutilization hospital service observed demand outpaces population actual need service australian study found opening emergency department within region led increase total volume emergency room visit local population growth suggesting service either provided unmet need overutilization however empirical evidence roemer law unequivocal thus effect hospital market entry service volume still need examined along influence pre-existing healthcare provider payment scheme incentivize healthcare provider activity well thus also influence efficiency quality availability

discussion perspective israeli healthcare system market entry assuta ashdod historic event provided opportunity examine effect community-based hospital-based hcu study result reveal increase utilization emergency room visit mri scan specialist visit requiring referral however unexpectedly decrease number primary care visit visit gastroenterology cardiology specialist requiring referral elective surgery addition number hospital admission total hospitalization day change following market entry health system characterized asymmetric information health provider patient may lead supplier-induced demand overuse healthcare service many study examined phenomenon wide range health service result showing increase emergency room visit mri scan specialist care visit correspond body literature increase use mri scan following market entry also similar study conducted ontario manaus excess use diagnostic procedure mri scan may derived defensive medicine desire respond patient demand request lack communication group doctor different specialty general physician radiologist orthopedic specialist case study required investigate whether mri scan wisely utilized assuta ashdod change payment method hospital also linked overuse study conducted swiss hospital significant reform hospital payment method towards diagnosed related group found increased demand mri scan ambulatory setting whereas decrease number performed hospitalization thus since hospitalization assuta ashdod mostly paid per diem scanning test may shifted outpatient setting ffs model applied opening emergency room assuta ashdod november number emergency room visit increase following two year average increase 0.5 number mhs enrollee city ashdod period similarly study australia demonstrated higher increase number emergency room visit following opening new emergency department compared rate population growth study period increase attributed unmet need likewise opening assuta ashdod provided solution scarce emergency service hospital opened clinically urgent case referred hospital located approximately away market entry assuta ashdod accompanied large health communication campaign emphasizing uniqueness hospital medical service including 24/7 presence physician specialized emergency medicine digital service security consideration innovative architecture patient privacy assume amenity aroused curiosity among mhs enrollee avoid unnecessary use service mhs developed intervention program included expansion community-based emergency medical service strengthening connection hospital community physician warranted examine whether new facility reduced mortality rate well related health outcome area opening outpatient clinic assuta ashdod increased availability accessibility service ashdod area resident indeed observed increase utilization specialist visit requiring referral number specialist visit requiring referral gastroenterology cardiology decreased market entry note change relatively modest may amplified due opposite trend observed control group netanya region cardiology department assuta ashdod employ expert various cardiology domain cardiologist working facility developed direct communication primary care physician create treatment continuum patient based partnership professional trust addition also started working community clinic increase exposure however study finding may imply mhs enrollee developed trust loyalty specialists—traits developed based patient characteristic expectation availability duration physician–patient relationship patient mostly develop loyalty doctor office location patient satisfaction trust loyalty also predict recommendation specific doctor others patient–physician relationship develop time longer follow-up market entry may required identify whether increase accessibility care integration hospital specialist community clinic indeed increase visit specialist care assuta ashdod another finding emerged analysis change hospital admission total hospitalization day finding line roemer law addition agreement expected influence payment mechanism hospitalization assuta ashdod per diem payment scheme incentivizes hospital increase hospitalization duration gap may stem unique model adopted assuta ashdod therapeutic continuum using integration unit consists multidisciplinary team mhs staff includes physician nurse paramedical professional administrative staff integration unit accompanies mhs patient family first day admission continuously communicating primary physician plan patient discharge e.g. rehabilitation care concept may shorten hospitalization duration would interesting examine time whether trend continues compared hospital unit exists well distinguish new repeated hospitalization ass efficiency unit finally finding indicate decrease number elective surgery market entry assuta ashdod contrary expected effect supplier-induced demand payment arrangement also differs finding study conducted united state opening ambulatory surgical center demonstrated increase volume activity offset decrease volume activity pre-existing medical center observed decrease may stem technical consideration namely change occurred assuta ashdod opened definition coding surgical procedure thus investigation required type procedure showed significant decrease analysis several limitation first subject defined mhs enrollee according eligibility one point time per research year thus possible data hcu mhs enrollee estimated year fact eligible month however since definition applied way study group pre- post-market entry assuta ashdod believe effect common applied similar extent across group throughout study period therefore affect study finding second data quality availability healthcare service e.g. ward exiting medical center physician available thus multivariable model adjusted variable albeit may affect study control group differently third analysis refer mhs enrollee ashdod region thus ignore influence market entry assuta ashdod locality included region however believe since analyzed major region may affected market entry result valid finally study examined data hcu two year market entry assuta ashdod therefore address long-term effect new provider entering healthcare system conclusion first study examined market entry assuta ashdod influenced community- hospital-based hcu finding may used model characterize inter-relationship hospital community care market entry led shift geographical distribution hcu supplier distant new provider supplier proximity provider necessarily translated increase utilization inpatient outpatient healthcare service short term possible unique model maintaining continuity care adopted assuta ashdod patient loyalty also led unique unexpected pattern hcu study required examine long-term pattern hcu following market entry subject expected change payment scheme well associated influence market entry health outcome
