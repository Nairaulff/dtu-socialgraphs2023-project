relationship level mental state full size table discussion result present study showed intensity exercise duration number session per week significantly decreased covid-19 outbreak compared result unexpected fear infection may limited various activity including social activity exercise may even led closure club outbreak furthermore change lifestyle combined fun leisure time led increase stress anxiety level society however closure physical activity linked many disease worsening obesity motor poverty health researcher therefore recommend modifying workout routine strengthen immune system due restriction closure sport club prevent spread coronavirus attending club become limited prevent consequence sedentary lifestyle obesity home exercise increased physical activity walking may beneficial furthermore result present study indicate moderate level exercise activity significantly reduce negative mood state caused fear covid-19 increase positive mood state sedentary resulted significant increase negative mood state significant decrease positive mood state study high level significantly related increased positive mood state also increased negative mood state general one important contributor physical mental health exercise improve body ability fight infection strengthening immune system however according study result intense competitive exercise may suitable condition reduce body immune response leading higher risk covid-19 infection study highlighted importance avoiding sedentary lifestyle common especially among young people spend excessive amount time social medium network addition improving immune function capacity help reduce anxiety stress improve mood manage underlying disease diabetes hypertension cardiovascular disease healthy adult engage least minute moderate-intensity exercise per day finding study suggest level significantly lower quarantine turn negative impact mood state among kermanshah population low level surprising given limitation movement exercise quarantine period inactivity may lead physical mental health issue supported finding mood state negatively impacted low level negative impact low level mood state seen study significant negative correlation level mood state participant engaged better mood state finding supported previous research shown exercise lead increased feeling well-being positive mood finding study important implication public health policy quarantine period crucial promote quarantine mitigate negative impact mental physical health include providing resource guidance home workout routine well encouraging outdoor adhering social distancing measure previous study shown physical inactivity become significant public health concern covid-19 pandemic several study reported decrease level healthy individual people chronic disease quarantine measure instance systematic review meta-analysis showed people lockdown pandemic significantly decreased level pandemic similarly hansen found evidence level decreased substantially covid-19 quarantine among general population furthermore research also shown low level covid-19 quarantine measure associated negative mood state maugeri demonstrated inactivity level covid-19 confinement positively correlated depression anxiety symptom severity similarly aghababa found lower level associated increased level stress anxiety depression among iranian individual quarantine covid-19 pandemic subsequent quarantine measure led increased period inactivity many individual profound effect hormone level body hormone play vital role various physiological process including mood regulation stress response metabolism immune function reduced physical activity change lifestyle quarantine disrupt hormone level potentially impacting mental physical health period inactivity quarantine stress hormone like cortisol may affected chronic stress reduced physical activity lead dysregulation hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hpa axis resulting abnormal cortisol level high cortisol level associated chronic stress contribute mood disorder impaired immune function metabolic disturbance study wilkialis found increased stress cortisol level among individual quarantine suggesting potential link inactivity quarantine dysregulated stress hormone level also inactivity reduced physical activity quarantine also influence metabolic hormone insulin leptin prolonged period inactivity sedentary behavior exacerbate insulin resistance increasing risk metabolic disorder like type diabetes sallis conducted study revealed reduced physical activity quarantine associated increased insulin resistance higher level leptin highlighting negative effect inactivity metabolic hormone level moreover physical activity known stimulate release mood-regulating hormone like serotonin dopamine endorphin promoting well-being reducing symptom depression anxiety therefore reduced physical activity quarantine may result imbalance mood-regulating hormone lesser found significant increase depressive symptom among individual lower level physical activity quarantine suggesting potential link reduced physical activity altered mood-regulating hormone level negative mental health outcome however covid-19 pandemic associated period inactivity quarantine significant effect hormone level body disruption stress hormone metabolic hormone mood-regulating hormone observed period potentially impacting mental physical health crucial recognize potential impact inactivity quarantine hormone level take step mitigate effect regular physical activity maintaining

enhances credibility additionally study offer clear recommendation public health policy quarantine emphasizing importance promoting physical activity mitigate negative impact mental physical health furthermore study mention large sample size enhances generalizability finding lastly study acknowledges limitation intense competitive exercise pandemic demonstrating balanced perspective overall strength contribute study credibility relevance potential impact public health policy quarantine limitation several limitation study titled level mood state covid-19 quarantine among kermanshah population cross-sectional online survey study may include self-reported data study relies self-reported level mood state may subject recall bias may accurately reflect participant true behavior emotional state limited generalizability study limited specific population kermanshah population may generalizable population different cultural socio-economic background online survey limitation survey conducted online may excluded individual access internet comfortable filling online survey cross-sectional design study cross-sectional design mean capture data single point time doe follow participant time confounding variable study ass potentially confounding variable medication use pre-existing medical condition may impact mood state quarantine however important acknowledge limitation order accurately interpret study finding understand scope research conclusion covid-19 quarantine discernible effect mood state individual kermanshah population notably level physical activity found play significant role influencing mood challenging period higher level associated improved mood state highlighting importance promoting physical activity mean enhancing mental health overall well-being future research focus exploring long-term effect mood state different population providing valuable insight potential benefit regular exercise time quarantine
