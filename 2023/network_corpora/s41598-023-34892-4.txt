introduction medical technology core healthcare delivery system key role medical technology underlined health technology management htm process indeed htm process encompasses many phase including acquisition decision-making-based phase according world health organization percentage percent medical device low- middle-income country poor usage due lack appropriate management policy one challenge optimize cost without compromising quality healthcare respond effectively acquisition medical equipment must shaped properly term planning selection resource allocation environment decision supplier ability deliver made complex high level ambiguity uncertainty competing stakeholder value complicated relationship result multiple competing objective also complication arise identifying appropriate relevant criterion assigning appropriate weight likely vary function many factor way lot time effort expense spent evaluating selecting medical equipment however must carefully chosen ensure function properly study address acquisition process concerning objective selection medical technology based standardization therefore set evaluation criterion well standard guideline specification must
