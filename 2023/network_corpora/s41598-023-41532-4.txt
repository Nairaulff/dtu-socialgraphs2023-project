introduction brucellosis zoonotic disease commonly affect human animal caused various specie genus brucella disease cause non-specific clinical symptom numerous side effect damage various organ four specie brucella potential infect human brucella abortus brucella melitensis brucella suis brucella canis brucella live inside macrophage protected extracellular environment also able become resistant

infected animal consumption unpasteurized dairy product even great progress brucellosis control developed country infection still important disease middle east following brucella entry macrophage preventing apoptosis ability bacteria adapt new environmental condition bacterial growth macrophage cell absence host self-protection subsequent treatment failure make eradication bacteria difficult thus re-infection occurs within first six month treatment nearly patient experience milder disease recurrence earlier stage end new approach needed reduce disease recurrence utilizing nanocarriers one
