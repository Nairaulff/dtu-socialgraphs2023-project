introduction leptospirosis neglected tropical disease one common bacterial zoonosis worldwide causing estimated 1.03 million case 58,900 death annually disease endemic many tropical country often seasonal distribution increasing heavy rain higher temperature leptospirosis major public health problem thailand average annual incidence rate 3.19 case per 100,000 population case fatality rate 0.04

contaminated environment daily activity various mammal rodent livestock domestic pet act reservoir host infection acquired infected urine contaminated environmental source typically floodwater causative agent leptospirosis spirochete genus leptospira specie described entire genus leptospira including pathogenic specie clinical infection present wide variety manifestation ranging mild
