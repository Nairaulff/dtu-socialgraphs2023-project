disorder e.g. obstructive vascular disease systemic connective tissue disease e.g. systemic sclerosis mixed connective tissue disease hematological disorder e.g. cryoglobulinemia endocrine disorder

limitation first small number patient enrolled furthermore consider selection bias clinical characteristic many patient visit clinical institute symptom may affect quality life improve time symptom may alleviated lifestyle modification moreover exclusion criterion comprised relatively large number patient follow-up period six month many patient seek subsequent physician care episode severe might occurred cold weather second retrospective design partly subjective concerning reviewing clinical information therapeutic outcome compliance however clinical chart review performed blindly scintigraphic finding third consider onset age duration previous report suggested age patient onset duration correlated radioactivity count patient finger palm critical limiting factor lack validated objective method assessing semiquantitative variable therefore study needed suggest standard variable imaging analysis many subject despite limitation study clinically essential investigating predictive value therapeutic response using 99m tc-hdp dynamic blood flow scintigraphy patient using objective predictive factor blood flow scintigraphy clinician strongly encourage patient therapeutic compliance good therapeutic response expected treatment involves explicitly strict adherence treatment including lifestyle modification consistent medication use directed poor therapeutic response predicted clinician consider increasing medication dosage adding medication conducting close clinical follow-up conclusion raynaud scintigraphy one-hand chilling method used predict whether
