introduction islam considered second religion world hijri islamic calendar also known lunar hijri calendar month start hijri calendar new crescent moon first sighted birth new moon although almost country world use gregorian calendar easy communication hijri calendar used muslim country muslim general across world come religious event ramadan among holy month muslim deciding start ramadan always challenging mission result muslim start ramadan synchronously main reason due reliance individual observation new crescent moon depends several factor affect final result tool used moon observation sky status whether clear cloudy location observation conducted proficiency observer etc furthermore technological advancement controversial opinion whether use eye sighting new crescent moon astronomical calculation method problem becomes even serious given number muslim worldwide time ramadan approach wait announcement first day ramadan latter ninth month hijri calendar month muslim fast sunrise till sunset additionally need consensus day among muslim world according indicated fig country world majority population muslim approximately muslim-populated country around world
