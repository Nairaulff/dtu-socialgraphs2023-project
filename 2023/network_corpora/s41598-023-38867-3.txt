domestic goat group differ performance test battery neither use physical social cue contrary recent research dog see wild domestic goat differ problem-solving performance—here ability use physical cue infer location reward turn finding social domain particularly surprising given much background literature dog-wolf comparison area indicating dog outperform wolf ability interpret human-given cue see however dog-wolf comparison approached caution recent research proposed wolf baseline capacity social attention cooperation underestimated so-called canine cooperation hypothesis contrast wolf goat recognized cooperative behaviour foraging hence overall performance goat social task especially among wild goat raise intriguing question factor underlying ability particularly surprising many wild

interpret human pointing gesture good performance socio-cognitive task wild goat question general domestication effect cognition non-companion domestic animal also find difference dwarf dairy goat performance physical social realm breeding high performance lead decrease extensive foraging social behaviour might also decrease behavioural flexibility farm animal see difference resource allocation apparently affect domestic goat performance using physical cue biological relevant degree given breed selected high production also often indirectly selected lower emotional reactivity i.e. avoid injury handler stress handling animal would expected selection line would differ least use social cue indeed follow-up experiment using total sample goat available research station see lower
