diet associated increase decrease circulating inflammatory intestinal permeability biomarkers healthy adult compared omnivore vegan vegetarian diet previous study inconclusive generally focus healthy normal-weight individual example strict low-carbohydrate diet associated increase circulating level crp inflammatory cytokine il-6 apparently healthy overweight participant whereas individual t2dm 2-year lchf diet resulted significant decrease crp level compared participant following high-carbohydrate low-fat diet participant metabolic syndrome obesity short-term ketogenic diet also resulted

improved inflammatory metabolic well cardiovascular risk factor selection dietary pattern therefore determining factor inflammatory status surprising diet may may consist healthy food provide optimal supply nutrient example person following lchf diet may choose predominantly plant animal fat source fried potato diverse vegetable grain product would considered vegan would provide different profile nutrient known number nutrient well non-nutritive bioactive component lifestyle factor influence different health parameter example shown previously intake sfa strongest predictor increased cholesterol found participant following lchf diet regarding inflammation long-chain ω-3 fatty acid particularly eicosapentaenoic acid docosahexaenoic acid modulate expression inflammation-related gene importantly precursor molecule resolvins maresins protectins involved resolution inflammation show ratio ω-3/ω-6 highest participant cluster characterized beneficial inflammatory profile consistent finding study using transgenic mouse model shown ratio ω-3/ω-6 acid tissue critical impact chronic disease including cancer inflammatory disease also influence microbiome therapeutic effect high ω-3/ω-6 acid number disease demonstrated dietary factor intake mufa pufa sfa dietary fiber also relevant—all parameter known associated inflammation however regardless fact participant lchf diet lowest intake fiber highest intake sfa still found different cluster suggesting complex regulation thus obvious dietary factor contribute inflammatory status indeed result suggest phase angle differs cluster different inflammatory intestinal permeability profile factor may depend diet also physical activity fact low physical activity found directly related higher level crp proinflammatory cytokine healthy individual pointed il-6 derived muscle physical activity condition due combination myokines doe act proinflammatory cytokine important difference cluster study night shift work also found increase risk metabolic syndrome suspected among causal factor obesity t2dm cardiovascular disease increasing exposure artificial light particularly blue spectrum increase nocturnal wakefulness leading disruption circadian rhythm promotes inflammation addition rotating shift worker shown irregular frequent meal increased snacking total 24-h energy intake overall appropriate choice food contribution factor excluded especially since recently shown gut microbiota composition could predicted accuracy based factor including anthropometric measure serum biomarkers lifestyle factor gastrointestinal symptom psychological factor specific nutrient intake since intestinal permeability consequently inflammatory status linked microbiota composition factor could considered relevant main advantage present study comparison previous research fact directly compared four dietary group pre-existing study mostly compared one separate pattern omnivore often western diet comprehensive data result standardized procedure including collection blood combination extensive information questionnaire dietary assessment 3-day weighting protocol anthropometric measurement enabled adjust important potential confounders however limitation study deserve mentioned sample participant relatively small cross-sectional design doe allow causal inference study included middle-aged healthy slovenian men woman therefore result may generalizable population ethnicity age group participant given detailed instruction correctly report food intake although food diary ffqs standardly used based self-report reliable direct monitoring may therefore considered limitation conclusion overall main conclusion present study dietary pattern significant influence inflammation intestinal permeability
