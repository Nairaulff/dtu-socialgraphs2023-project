introduction risk evaluation oviposition site crucial fitness organism choosing inappropriate site place offspring risk reduce offspring performance ovipositing organism faced plethora challenge may choose appropriate oviposition site avoid predator competition risk however oviposition site selection requires animal evaluate multiple possibly conflicting sensory signal associated risk benefit example gravid female plutella xylostella detects natural enemy risk oviposition site preferred host moth tends chooses alternate host oviposition despite knowing offspring may develop poorly alternate host study reveals herbivorous insect must evaluate risk natural enemy quality oviposition site gravid female survival offspring crucial nutritional quality oviposition site hence oviposition site selection behavior provides excellent mean evaluate animal perceive rank various risk greater wax moth galleria mellonella lepidoptera pyralidae noxious pest honeybee .the moth
