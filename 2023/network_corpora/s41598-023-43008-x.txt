introduction last decade several study investigated neurodevelopment psychiatric disorder using brain data acquired via structural magnetic resonance imaging smri analysis shown great potential smri data biomarker one main asset current methodology ability perform relatively precise characterization brain structure essential using structural neuroimaging data understand brain mechanism psychiatric disorder moreover smri biomarkers already important part clinical assessment neurodegenerative disease alzheimer prevalent dementia unfortunately psychiatric disorder still rely solely
