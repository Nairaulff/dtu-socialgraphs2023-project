consistent study ethiopia tanzania major concern light increased risk developing decreasing gestational age finding higher proportion anti-rubella igg positivity among urban dweller compared rural one consistently reported several study african country possible reason might crowded living condition urban population increase risk rubella transmission study strength one investigation rubella virus infection among pregnant woman ethiopia finding study inform decision-makers prevalence recent rubella virus infection status susceptibility rubella virus infection plan intervention effort aimed reducing incidence however study faced limitation since participant recruited health facility finding may compared pregnant woman study area study might powered adequately identify socio-demographic reproductive characteristic associated rubella infection study participant interviewed health facility health worker data collection relied participant self-reports might subject social desirability recall information bias conclusion high proportion pregnant woman exposure rubella virus particularly urban area indicates endemicity infection ethiopian context observed proportion recent infection particularly pregnant woman first trimester may reflect significance study area finding call intervention reduce risk including vaccinating susceptible woman childbearing rubella virus introducing vaccine routine childhood immunization programme
