introduction coronavirus disease covid-19 pandemic ongoing year number case continues increase worldwide due constant mutation virus evolution infectivity evasion immunity nevertheless proportion people surviving covid-19 substantially increased compared initial outbreak owing improvement treatment method preventive vaccination strategy severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 sars-cov-2 causative agent covid-19 often associated long-term symptom known post-covid-19 condition long covid covid-19 primarily affect respiratory system evidence relevant literature indicates also affect digestive cardiovascular nervous reproductive system according world health organization long covid defined continuation development new symptom month initial sars-cov-2 infection symptom

moreover long covid associated poor health-related quality life patient moderate severe covid-19 mild asymptomatic covid-19 notably population-representative survey united state reported high

kingdom office national statistic survey fatigue continued commonly reported symptom among individual long covid patient self-reported long covid followed difficulty concentrating furthermore china follow-up study long covid patient admitted intensive care unit confirmed fatigue common symptom additionally previous study suggested postviral somatic mental symptom neuroimmune neuro-oxidative origin present study fatigue mental symptom accounted majority long covid symptom month acute covid-19 according previous study risk mood anxiety disorder subsides 1–2 month infection whereas risk

moreover reported depressive psychopathology commonly affect cognitive performance interacts cognitive function determining quality life additionally sankey flow diagram showed correlation among neuropsychological symptom previous study year acute covid-19 long covid developed frequently patient moderate higher illness severity asymptomatic patient prospective observational study post-covid-19 chronic fatigue syndrome reported associated symptom severity previous study involving month-follow-ups patient covid-19 suggested patient severe disease activity 1.45 1.54 time likely develop fatigue muscle weakness anxiety depressive symptom respectively moreover moderate higher disease severity acute covid-19 identified risk factor odds ratio 3.02 long-term fatigue symptom month acute covid-19 however study anxiety depressive symptom associated disease activity month acute covid-19 notably individual long covid symptom year exhibited poor health-related quality life hrqol high mental health abnormality increased healthcare use discharge compared without long covid symptom moreover previous study reported quality life may worsen follow-up covid-19 compared participant without covid-19 covid-19 survivor continued exhibit higher symptom prevalence pain discomfort anxiety depressive symptom year infection however hrqol continued improve nearly domain particularly anxiety depression proportion participant reporting anxiety depressive symptom decreasing significantly month year covid-19 present study compared ability perform usual activity pain/discomfort patient month covid-19 month infection improved however number people reduced quality life anxiety depressive symptom significantly change 34.1 32.7 month covid-19 respectively addition 1.6 respondent stated experienced severely reduced quality life anxiety depressive symptom newly identified unlike previous study median participant age year study included young people median age year suggesting younger age group affected covid-19 long covid symptom older age group finding consistent previous study reporting risk developing long covid increase age factor affecting decrease hrqol could attributed emotional social factor related covid-19 outbreak depending situation country additionally social isolation due long-lasting covid-19 pandemic major contributor depressive symptom associated long covid symptom poor quality life according study long covid patient discharged covid-19-treatment specialized hospital korea patient considered challenging return normal life owing presence post-covid-19 symptom particular returning daily life found difficult older people present study 6.1 respondent receiving outpatient treatment long covid consequently affected daily quality life present study included patient exhibiting mild disease severity acute illness finding revealed long covid could persist long time patient covid-19 suggesting long covid long-term social burden even mildly infected patient thus account majority patient infected covid-19 finding uk-based survey suggest post-infection vaccination reduces symptomatic burden long covid first dose sustained improvement second dose notably patient long covid immune system dysregulation may benefit reset autoimmune process via vaccination although whether effect long-lasting remains unestablished residual viral reservoir may also destroyed due antibody response present study 96.2 respondent vaccinated covid-19 furthermore month 71.2 respondent reported suspected long covid symptom amnesia identified 21.2 respondent month covid-19 rate increased 30.3 month infection concentration difficulty identified 22.0 respondent month covid-19 rate increased 24.2 month infection notably decreased gray matter temporal lobe patient covid-19 highlighted increased risk later neurodegeneration dementia due viral invasion central nervous system moreover previous study consistently reported association covid-19 memory impairment indicated result present study neuropsychological effect long covid significantly compromise quality life adult exhibiting mild covid-19 however impact vaccination people long-term covid symptom remains controversial therefore well-designed research effect covid-19 vaccination improvement persistence long-term covid symptom acute covid-19 long-term effect covid-19 vaccination warranted study limitation first due long-term follow-up period study nonhomogeneity patient may limitation interpreting whether persistent symptom related long covid moreover factor sociocultural difference may influenced result survey therefore study different sociocultural background needed elucidate effect long covid second limitation online survey individualized test cognitive function could performed comparison thus study using objective cognitive test must applied individual difference substantiated literature third difficult state sample highly representative given population time survey respondent severe critical disease activity acute covid-19 older adult may experienced difficulty participating online survey furthermore individual exhibiting long covid symptom may participated actively survey leading relatively high incidence long covid among respondent strength study revealed long-term effect covid-19 relatively young patient mild acute illness excluding confounding factor reinfection case remarkably long covid symptom manifested various form month acute covid-19 illness even patient vaccinated covid-19 furthermore result suggest even month acute covid-19 prevalence long covid symptom reduced quality life patient covid-19 concern represents long-term social burden regardless severity disease conclusion although long covid usually improves time neuropsychiatric symptom persist month acute infection occur frequently symptom patient mild covid-19 disease account majority patient covid-19 may continue poor quality life addition occurrence long covid doe appear significantly affected covid-19 vaccination number vaccination received therefore ongoing research long covid needed better understand potential long-term health consequence covid-19 including persistence symptom impact quality life effectiveness intervention vaccination
