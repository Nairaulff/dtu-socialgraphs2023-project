introduction recently attention focused impact air pollution individual health obesity allergic rhinitis major public health issue worldwide therefore determining association air pollution obesity crucial however association previously studied regarding relationship air pollution epidemiological biological study find association regarding relationship obesity epidemiological biological study also find association air pollution induce recruitment inflammatory cell inflammatory cytokine obesity considered chronic inflammatory illness study also found aforementioned inflammatory cell cytokine induced air pollutant also increased people obesity indicated air pollution obesity share immune inflammatory effect human body therefore reasonable speculate air pollutant might stronger adverse effect severity obese however separate relationship air pollution obesity air pollution obesity studied combined association air pollution obesity studied therefore retrospective cross-sectional case–control study conducted find association aimed investigate influence air pollutant severity rhinitis quality life degree nasal obstruction nasal mucosa inflammation among child obese non-obese method air pollutant environmental protection administration established five air pollution monitoring station taichung taiwan concentration air pollutant ambient temperature relative

nasal obstruction mucosa inflammation obese child study find relationship higher 2.5 nmhc concentration higher degree nasal obstruction/inflammation lower npef rate study result compatible study study suggest air pollution could induce nasal obstruction nasal mucosa inflammation obese child study also find relationship higher 2.5 concentration higher discomfort symptom higher prqlq score therefore speculate induction nasal obstruction mucosa inflammation 2.5 negative impact nasal discomfort symptom obese child also found non-obese child correlation air pollution discomfort/symptoms nasal obstruction/mucosa inflammation exposed pollutant rhinitis symptom exacerbated immunological long-term effect neurogenic short-term effect mechanism study air pollution data gathered within day test short duration impact air pollution might caused neurogenic effect study trigeminal nerve innervates nasal cavity study indicated activating trigeminal nerve ending air pollution exposure trigger rhinitis another study indicated obesity increase nociceptive activation trigeminal system external stimulation abovementioned finding might explain result showed air pollution detrimental effect obese compared without obesity rat mouse study found airborne particulate matter transported via trigeminal nerve may also induce neurotoxicity oxidative stress neuro-inflammation nerve another study indicated particle observed human trigeminal ganglion capillary implies could influence trigeminal nerve might result exacerbating child obesity study found stronger correlation 2.5 prqlq severe symptom npef severe nasal obstruction inflammation two aforementioned study might explain stronger correlation 2.5 compared air pollutant reduction sympathetic tone cause venous sinusoid dilatation contribute nasal obstruction symptom suggested men higher sympathetic tone woman higher parasympathetic autonomic activity study indicated woman appear sensitive intranasal trigeminal stimulation men another study reported sex-differentiated electrophysiological response intranasal trigeminal stimulus finding could explain stronger correlation observed prqlq npef air pollution 2.5 female child obesity study compared male child two molecular mechanism might explain study result first air pollution could induce nasal inflammation obese child chronic inflammatory state second air pollution could induce neuro-inflammation obese child study result air pollutant induce higher nasal obstruction/inflammation obese child could explain first speculation however role neuro-inflammation investigated study future study necessary ambient temperature relative humidity reported influence severity meteorological condition including temperature humidity also report correlated concentration air pollutant therefore temperature humidity could influence severity concentration air pollutant adjusted investigating association air pollution however study investigating relationship air pollution child adjust two co-factors two co-factors adjusted study find association obesity air pollution accurate furthermore study limitation first study conducted single center therefore reflect general profile entire population owing selection bias second potential confounders dietary habit physical activity emotional factor analyzed third child moderate severe assessed study therefore future study including child different clinic area patient mild gathering confounding factor dietary habit physical activity emotional factor required conclusion association air pollution obesity remain unclear date study first demonstrated air pollutant 2.5 negatively impacted discomfort symptom rhinitis obese child rather non-obese child obese child attain higher pollutant concentration increased nasal obstruction inflammation might mechanism underlining present study finding suggests child obesity avoid exposure air pollutant specifically 2.5 although observed significant correlation air pollutant obesity taiwan regional difference air pollution concentration socioeconomic status race could also altered outcome therefore future study incorporate diverse group participant significant variation geographical location socioeconomic status race sex biological study explain association obesity air pollution required
