female disadvantage functional difficulty fall outcome observed previous study woman weaker quadriceps muscle declining bone density compared male especially menopause may contribute sex difference also fact woman live longer men consequently likely experience adverse health event age explain sex difference finding study also show significant rural–urban disparity following prior evidence specifically older adult dwelling rural india reported higher rate adl iadl difficulty fall multiple fall fall injury poor functional status rural resident may reflect inadequate health health care infrastructure finding thus suggest intervention improve functional health focus diverse group older adult namely older woman rural older adult fewer socioeconomic resource self-care finding study
