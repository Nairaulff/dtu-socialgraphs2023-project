nationwide crowdsourcing campaign punkkilive www.punkkilive.fi/en launched punkkilive ticklive interactive website user report observe tick sighting daily updating interactive map punkkilive running since april obtained tick observation time campaign kept running nearly indefinitely due requiring little input researcher obvious drawback tick specie present location identified crowdsourced data tick contact generally likely depict tick present uncertainty related method acquiring presence data firstly question whether people participating correctly identify tick likely due high medium coverage regarding tick tick-borne disease well locally rather unique feeding habit tick found attached human pet generally well identified finland crowdsourcing study almost sample reported tick acarus ixodidae whereas punkkilive data 97.2 picture sent website represented tick whereas identifiably animal specie secondly since tick observed often detected nature rather host human dog cat precise location tick acquired often uncertain however problem mitigated widening scale phenomenon observed although procedure sacrifice precision finally another potential issue tick may transported long distance e.g dog prior detected human thus even provided coordinate data precise tick location reported citizen participating crowdsourcing campaign may fact reflect actual area tick acquired and/or area tick population present order mitigate effect imported tick assessment need made regarding deemed unlikely observation could imported tick despite drawback regarding crowdsourced data

rovaniemi consequently likely indicating northernmost tick population finland fig individual report tick contact received tick observation reported annually punkkilive municipality rovaniemi 2021–2023 unpublished data consequently appears probable tick contacted locally consistently majority specie present remains undetermined tick sample received area ricinus persulcatus recorded case spread either tick specie north seems unlikely time due shortness vegetation period beyond rovaniemi however greater average warming observed subarctic recent decade change enabling spread may occur sooner anticipated highlighted different methodology used estimate ltcas single report person stating tick common municipality sufficient status qualitative data whereas several observation would required assessment based observation count quantitative data clear method assessment fully comparable difficult estimate might reliable general observation area likely least tick acquired therein however universal guideline determine cutoff point report citizen may expected represent local tick population case assessment cutoff based several northern municipality occurrence local tick population unlikely however unclear well trend relating observation number observer north reflected southern municipality generally higher population density data municipality-level assessment mostly based single answer questionnaire highly subjective single respondent may reporting personal observation made nature one summer case veterinary observation several animal several year leading difference extent reliability assessment nevertheless keeping mind uncertainty regarding data worth remembering even single observation environmentally suitable location indicate local tick population chosen method assessing ltcas may considered rather conservative prone underestimation overestimation tick contact rate appeared highest along coastline shore large lake southern central eastern part country possibly indicating higher tick abundance therein indeed field study conducted along coastline island southwestern finland indicated higher tick abundance compared e.g inland area proximate large water body likewise similar trend spatial distribution observed regarding incidence lyme borreliosis finland estimated tick contact per inhabitant generally rose mainly maintained overarching structure lower contact higher contact area wherein higher contact rate reported along coastline large inland lake longitudinal study largely missing finland indication increasing tick abundance study conducted also supporting increasing tick abundance across country number diagnosed borreliosis tbe case increasing past decade finally university turku tick project www.puutiaiset.fi received many testimony citizen claiming new occurrence higher tick abundance around houses/summer cottage past decade unpublished data consequently appears increasing trend tick occurrence abundance across country however uncertain whether could explain change tick contact rate likely factor involved indeed important highlight assessing tick abundance based observation per inhabitant crowdsourced data general form tentative proxy several factor influence result apart tick abundance context crowdsourcing study factor include higher medium coverage awareness study leading higher percentage population aware

borreliosis case finland several report citizen increasing tick density unpublished data increased contact due higher tick abundance and/or new area tick occurrence remain plausible explanation case
