introduction fall fall-related injury significant health concern older adult world health organization defining fall state lying ground floor low level caused unintentional activity incidence fall increasing world population age higher rate observed developing country compared industrialized nation globally estimated older adult experience least one fall year approximately half requiring medical attention due multiple fall fall leading cause injury mortality among aged world health organization predicts fall could rise 21st 17th place worldwide ranking cause mortality preventative measure implemented fall increase risk severity injury related disease elderly also lead significant disability dysfunction death resulting higher treatment cost lower quality life research attempted quantify burden fall injury requiring medical attention likely comorbidities without fall comorbidity associated reduced recovery increased risk long-term disability mortality fall-related injury also place significant economic burden patient family due high cost treatment vietnam average cost treating fall-related injury approximately additional expense meal transportation caregiving also adding financial burden vietnam aging population increasing rapidly older adult accounting 11.8 total population compared 8.7 given trend developing effective fall prevention treatment care strategy elderly crucial although several study investigated cost fall vietnam study focused treatment cost impact fall older adult thoroughly investigated therefore study aim estimate treatment cost cost burden

compared study topic fall treatment cost patient study lower explained disparity medical expense nation well difference healthcare quality measure aid fall prevention help reduce unjustified cost burden similar previous study study found direct non-medical cost including food travel cost accounted total cost patient must pay however study topic direct medical cost accounted highest proportion patient higher direct non-medical cost difference explained direct cost estimation method used study surgical charge constituted greatest share hospitalization cost older patient fall injury patient history low back pain hard-tissue injury paying patient higher treatment cost lower affordability inpatient compared outpatient reflected fact patient tended prefer inpatient medical service resulting higher administrative cost reduce economic burden patient fall injury need enhance high-value medical supply management regulate medical equipment provider excessive profit fight cost-effective material selection without sacrificing patient safety study found fall patient live spouses/partners afford treatment cost higher patient live alone besides caregiver patient treated fall would pay patient spouse partner play critical role assisting daily activity mobility rehabilitation exercise even emotional psychological support crucial patient recovering fall-related injury ensuring patient recover effectively furthermore finding study show family member vital role lowering healthcare cost spouse partner assist reducing healthcare bill insurance claim well ensuring patient medical need satisfied presence also reduce financial burden perhaps eliminating need pricey professional caregiver lengthier hospital stay research emphasizes value splitting treatment cost falling patient live spouses/partners presence spouse partner offer sense financial security alleviates concern paying treatment fee greatly reduce financial pressure associated medical treatment finding suggests besides fall-prevented program caregiver training support program established empower spouses/partners provide effective care support home reducing need extensive hospital stay costly professional assistance limitation study acknowledged convenience sampling used study doe reflect representative result patient treated fall vietnam additionally cross-sectional study information health status expenditure collected patient self-reports might lead recall error cost measurement numerous indirect expenditure healthcare personnel fixed asset administration equipment operating fee excluded projected cost provided study expense removed owing time resource constraint deserve additional future research conclusion result study show fall injury pose significant financial burden elderly especially live alone patient low income fall prevention program essential reduce risk fall financial burden patient family society addition caregiver medical staff propagated instructed prevent fall especially
