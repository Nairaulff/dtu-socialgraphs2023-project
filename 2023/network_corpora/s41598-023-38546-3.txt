introduction recent advancement medical science led significant improvement treatment outcome diabetic retinopathy however global prevalence expected remain high consequently vision loss working population also likely significant social issue worldwide future early diagnosis important good visual outcome patient may recognize seriousness disease vision deteriorates significantly therefore detection fine relevant change visual function could extremely valuable making patient aware illness substantial visual loss occurs well encouraging facilitating treatment compliance moreover recent

impact overall quality life patient approval based clinical trial detection subtle significant visual change may necessary issue related clinical trial neuroprotective intervention would initiated retinal neural degeneration visual function impairment become substantial irreversible effect would detected high sensitivity shorten trial period given neurodegeneration progress gradually difference
