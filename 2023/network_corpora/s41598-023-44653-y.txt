mortality covid-19 vaccination pregnant woman safe effective preventive measure reduce risk covid–19–associated complication mother child however covid-19 uptake still target worldwide according

hypothesise group could concerned safety side effect population black parda/brown skin colour associated covid-19 vaccine uptake pregnancy however majority study pointed black non-white hispanic race likely vaccinated white conflicting finding self-identified skin colour education could related brazilian social inequity regional diversity political context accessibility vaccine available public health system enables access pregnant woman vaccination attend public antenatal care probably receiving recommendation shot visit historically unified public health system assist proportionally people lower income level black brown self-identified colour low educational level could explain higher uptake group pregnant woman without partner twice likely vaccinated living partner study contrast finding among woman reproductive age single associated lower covid-19 vaccination likelihood moreover single mother low-middle-income country frequently economic provider family thus decision vaccinate prevent getting ill could considered way avoiding absenteeism maintaining work capacity employment covid-19 pandemic previous study showed antenatal care appointment prenatal nurse follow-up counselled vaccination health care provider increase likelihood vaccination pregnancy conversely antenatal care onset first quarter pregnancy decrease uptake finding demonstrate impact early complete antenatal care essential measure vaccine education recommendation accessibility pregnancy rio janeiro well-established maternal health program maintains woman early complete antenatal care additionally history miscarriage may influence perception covid-19 susceptibility severity vaccine benefit therefore woman history fetal loss could preventive pregnancy hence accepting vaccination protection unborn child note also described subset woman vaccinated pregnancy higher proportion older age white self-identified skin colour year education however group objective study possible woman prioritised receive covid-19 vaccine earlier due pre-existing condition high risk complication increased exposure healthcare worker high quality brazilian data population size breadth data strength study furthermore one first study address factor associated covid-19 vaccine uptake pregnant woman brazil provide new evidence low vaccine uptake population study limitation particularly related use secondary data source routinely administrative data collected research proposal limited information available therefore able study important variable use private insurance linkage error another potential limitation although linkage error occur woman may likely link others linkage approach bespoke manual review performed improve linkage accuracy additionally important note incomplete data occur however amount missing data variable relatively low supplementary table study include pregnant woman abortion stillbirth multiple gestation therefore result presented study generalized group wide misinformation released social medium concern regarding vaccine safety scepticism disease risk political context could influenced uptake among pregnant woman yet addressed herein better investigated study moreover factor associated vaccine uptake may vary one place another therefore generalised brazilian municipality conclusion covid-19 vaccination uptake remains poor among pregnant woman brazil higher uptake among older year black brown self-identified skin colour low level education living without partner six appointment previous child loss rio janeiro city finding contribute planning targeted educational campaign trustful communication accessibility strategy specific population improve vaccine uptake since pregnant woman widely benefit covid-19 vaccination factor
