adjunctive therapy catheter ablation showed promising result decreasing recurrence risk adding conventional pulmonary vein isolation however contradictory finding exist regarding therapeutic effect

altering effect burst atrial pacing although catheter-based rdn suggested adjunctive therapeutic modality contradictory result catheter-based approach introduced alternative surgical approach surgical

discussed earlier renal sympathetic nerve abundant around renal artery complex manner reported renal nerve may fully destructed using catheter-based rdn human limited lesion depth however 16–30 renal nerve fiber located away endoluminal surface renal artery ablate renal nerve located far artery higher power longer duration energy delivery required catheter-based approach however increased energy delivery increase risk injury endoluminal surface renal artery stenosis therefore catheter-based rdn may difficult completely destroy renal nerve using catheter-based rdn furthermore catheter-based approach may feasible case severe renal artery stenosis narrow diameter renal artery significant atherosclerosis plaque anomalous anatomy consequently novel approach needed increase efficacy overcome inherent limitation catheter-based approach recently developed novel laparoscopic rdn system novel laparoscopy-based approach could safer alternative surgical approach owing minimal invasiveness
