introduction atrial fibrillation common cardiac arrhythmia affect million people worldwide associated increased morbidity including cardioembolic stroke systemic arterial embolism myocardial infarction heart failure dementia increased risk mortality although affect adult age incidence higher older individual prevalence increased 0.1 younger adult age adult aged year older anticoagulant therapy mainstay prevention stroke systemic embolism patient additional stroke risk factor example anticoagulation therapy includes warfarin low-molecular-weigh heparin lmwh unfractionated heparin ufh direct oral anticoagulant doacs dabigatran apixaban rivaroxaban edoxaban advanced age also associated increased risk developing cancer given cancer prevalent older adult numerous older adult multiple chronic condition co-occurrence cancer expected recent nationwide population-based study demonstrated increased risk incident adjusted hazard ratio 1.63 confident interval 1.61–1.66 patient cancer use

risk death cause study fourfold higher group prescribed lmwh/ufh compared prescribed warfarin death rate warfarin doacs observed study comparable post-hoc analysis aristotle trial patient cancer reported 4.7 3.6 death per patient-years patient received apixaban warfarin respectively reason underlying higher death rate associated lmwh/ufh study unclear might explained patient underlying condition anticoagulant effectiveness one strength study provided real-world data usage anticoagulant among cancer patient also atrial fibrillation prior following cancer diagnosis study limitation first perform subgroup analysis four different type doacs small number patient category second include cancer patient receive anticoagulant therapy therefore could compare risk stroke/systemic embolism bleeding two group third use anticoagulant based prescription record therefore could estimate compliance rate impact compliance outcome fourth given retrospective nature data collection encountered limitation obtaining comprehensive data required classify severity bleeding according international society thrombosis haemostasis isth guideline however important note bleeding outcome captured sufficient severity necessitate hospitalization considered clinically relevant finally participant enrolled considering doacs approved prevention stroke systemic embolism patient enrolled period likely receive warfarin treatment however important note proportion patient specific period relatively small moreover sensitivity analysis conducted excluding patient yielded result consistent primary analysis conclusion study found lmwh/ufh compared warfarin cancer patient associated increased risk stroke furthermore doacs associated similar risk stroke bleeding compared warfarin based finding recommend caution use lmwh/ufh cancer patient prospective trial needed confirm finding
