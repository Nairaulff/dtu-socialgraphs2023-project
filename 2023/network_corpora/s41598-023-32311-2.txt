introduction coronavirus disease covid-19 caused sars-cov-2 infection spread continuously worldwide despite comprehensive vaccination study reported center disease control prevention cdc showed three dos mrna vaccine including bnt162b2 mrna-1273 higher efficacy sars-cov-2 infection two dos vaccination delta-predominant period period omicron emergence japan japanese people completed two dos vaccine mainly using mrna vaccine sars-cov-2 end august addition japanese people received three dos beginning september particular japanese people continued comply public health measure wearing mask keeping social distancing even receiving booster dos despite vaccine administration effort compliance public infection control measure number covid-19 case surged rapidly omicron variant emerged omicron variant considered transmissible delta variant addition previous study november april reported percentage asymptomatic infection ranged 23.0 46.7 percentage higher country high vaccination coverage compared low coverage moreover recent cohort serological study u.s. participant given three dos vaccine reported half omicron infection asymptomatic and/or occurred without awareness previous study showed high transmissibility also infection without awareness might cause wider transmission omicron variant subvariants spread rapidly across japan since early tokyo experienced high number daily

sars-cov-2 infection would cause community transmission high transmissibility omicron variant also unawareness infection might caused person-to-person transmission contributed surge seroprevalence juh study limitation first conducted single medical center high vaccination rate younger female hcws therefore interpretation present study result done cautiously applied general population tokyo second

among japanese hcws especially onset omicron variant infection without awareness might key causal factor rapid person-to-person transmission highly vaccinated medical center real-world evidence showed vaccination natural infection hcws likely lighter symptom infected sars-cov-2 future similar trend expected seen japan hand covid-19 remains threat public japan due strong impact high-risk population including large number elderly frequently visit hospital and/or need inpatient medical care thus preventing infection without awareness among hcws consequently preventing possible nosocomial infection critical medical setting although might difficult completely control spread medical facility continued effort including routine temperature testing maintenance good hygiene habit universal masking
