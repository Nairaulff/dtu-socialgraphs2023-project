introduction impairment intellectual adaptive functioning behavior characterize intellectual disability type neurodevelopmental disorder adaptive behavior defined conceptual social practical skill involving task performed person everyday life young people often exhibit delay maturation motor growth varying degree limit functional ability postural control one motor skill people tend experience limitation postural control one motor skill people tend experience limitation phenomenon explained physiopathology usually involves degree incomplete development central nervous system cns control motor cognitive function people age prematurely healthy people postural control deteriorates age decline various postural control subsystem primarily somatoaesthetic vestibular visual subsystem study shown gait deceleration early indicator balance decline various evaluation tool motor development skill commonly used young people clinical test evaluation balance gait commonly used population berg balance scale tinetti scale single-leg stance functional reach test frt lateral reach test lrt biodex balance system force plate timed tug functional balance scale useful reporting balance disorder identify type disorder underlying balance disorder however performance balance test usually examine performance series test evaluating functional balance single multi-item test usually applied test including item tandem standing standing one foot provide information balance disorder multi-item test provide much useful information postural control longer one system group balance postural reflex postural control complicated skill comprises compromise sensorimotor process according case balance evaluation system test bestest recently developed based conceptual model balance control six different system domain contribute balance control bestest evaluates following system biomechanical constraint stability limit verticality anticipatory postural adjustment automatic postural response sensory organization gait stability tool special assessment age severity parkinson disease cerebral ataxia disorder vestibular disorder neuropathy brain damage multiple sclerosis brain stroke cerebral

individual intellectual disability limited scope research example child nervous disorder measuring probable disorder system involved postural control important example child cerebral palsy demonstrated disorder anticipatory mechanism feed-forward postural adjustment musculoskeletal system muscular strength joint range motion required static balance sensory system visual function
