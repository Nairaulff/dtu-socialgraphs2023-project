introduction grassland bird among endangered terrestrial vertebrate europe threatened habitat transformation mainly agricultural pastoral intensification iberian peninsula important stronghold many grassland bird europe many unfavourable conservation status little bustard tetrax tetrax one specie classified globally near threatened vulnerable europe portugal also priority specie conservation european bird directive 2009/147/ce result vast network special protection area spa designated goal maintaining enhancing conservation status turn millennium portugal little bustard population showed indicator good conservation status first national survey conducted revealed widespread high breeding density region corresponded highest breeding density ever recorded specie year breeding population crashed nationwide decline approximately greater rate decline seen region proportion cattle total stocking rate higher portugal agricultural policy changed particularly last two decade replacing extensive dry cereal cultivation one centred permanent pasture beef production tended intensified growing number grazers due shorter vegetation sward quality breeding habitat impacted making unsuitable breeding common agricultural policy cap designed increase food self-sufficiency primary cause habitat loss degradation farmland bird western europe cap fund portugal stopped supporting

decline compared outcome modelling procedure previous analysis based first two survey 2003–2006 found similar finding main driver explaining variation little bustard density area higher bustard density first survey higher proportion cattle within livestock rate related steeper decline area initial higher breeding density coincided well-conserved site subsequently degraded leading greater absolute little bustard loss greater decline also associated higher density road model likely better captured pattern seen within spa breeding density variation survey greater compared observed outside spa breeding density outside spa low 2003–2006 despite widespread holding significant portion population resulted overall low variation breeding density overall decline registered nonetheless significant loss breeding habitat observed outside spa driven conversion permanent crop likely contributed decline contraction isolation remaining breeding population common agricultural policy cap incentive last two decade contributed decisively towards major conversion dry cereal farming permanent pasture mostly beef production within full extent little bustard distribution portugal impact conversion little bustard already identified previously demonstrate change still ongoing even intensified current management cattle farm beef production extremely specialised simplifying landscape towards permanent pasture lesser extent fodder crop mostly hay field additionally system intensified notable rise quantity intensity grazing despite increasing number severe drought greatly reduce plant biomass pasture overgrazing lead habitat loss degradation impacting vegetation structure smaller vegetation sward increase frequency severity drought episode related climate change impact vegetation structure deteriorate breeding habitat consequence overgrazing may also relate food availability since intensity grazing shown affect insect abundance arthropod particularly orthoptera coleoptera critically important development little bustard chick lack trophic availability may jeopardise breeding productivity hand hay field likely acting ecological trap providing suitable nesting habitat cut peak nesting stage destroying nest chick adult shown previous study recent study show breeding population little bustard iberia skewed sex-ratio towards male level may increase probability extinction supporting hypothesis viability little bustard population western europe threatened excess female mortality similar threat found france destruction nest mowing alfalfa field identified one main factor contributing breeding failure population decline specie late effect anthropogenic infrastructure road identified important predictor explaining variation little bustard breeding density previous work found road create avoidance effect powerlines hand show relationship varying density contrary found analysing period 2003–2016 likely related shift specie distribution mainly within spa whereas power line concentrated outside spa factor decline factor identified work relate decline little bustard density occurred principally within context spa area outside spa hand subjected considerable habitat loss degradation result major investment irrigation scheme enabled intensive agriculture principally permanent crop olive almond irrigation scheme located area productive soil historically coincided lower breeding density area important little bustard post-breeding season due greater availability food resource hottest driest season year consequently habitat loss fragmentation area may lead greater energy expenditure searching suitable post-breeding area usually outside spa may also increase bird risk collision power line additionally intensification agriculture increased use pesticide contributes significantly decline farmland bird either indirectly limiting habitat food availability source directly toxic effect affect bird survival fitness reproduction non-natural mortality also high likely contributing specie decline particularly take account specie low breeding productivity powerlines alone responsible estimated 3.4–3.8 adult annual mortality poaching reach another 2.4–3 particularly vulnerable non-breeding area conservation implication iberian breeding population harboured half world population undergone steeply mostly due pac-driven habitat loss degradation current rate decline little bustard portugal severe unsustainable possible cause widespread rapid decline include number threat acting synergistically permanent pasture beef production relate greater loss breeding density likely represent ecological trap compromising breeding productivity potential source female mortality conversion potential breeding habitat permanent crop hand resulted significant habitat loss outside spa caused population decline range contraction adding threat non-natural mortality climate change specie extinction inevitable short term action put place spa isolated present metapopulational structure could challenge bustard perform greater post-breeding movement towards area greater food availability post-breeding summer season previous work shown implementation targeted agri-environmental program based identification limiting factor halt population decline even recover depleted population portugal several spa designated
