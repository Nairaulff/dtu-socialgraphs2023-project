therefore marine could cause decrease population size marine fish marine resource recent sport development replaced natural turf artificial turf also referred synthetic turf due low maintenance requirement cost saving greater access weather condition instance japan artificial turf field increased approximately sport field annually approximately field 2000–2019 today 10,000 field exist united

therefore artificial turf sport field could one source marine present study also demonstrated water ingested fish goldfish wild crucian carp first demonstration active ingestion artificial turf field fish result showed possibility released aquatic environment could ingested wild fish natural factor wind outflow rainwater malformed surface caused sport activity long period time greatly contribute microscale site variance migration artificial turf field surrounding ditch sediment two sampling site consisted ten time w/w compared two site nonetheless since ditch connected sewer pipe rts ditch likely sent river near university sewage treatment plant fiber artificial turf also found sediment survey although quantification made present study two type sewage system japan old type sewage system transport wastewater rainwater sewage treatment plant new system transport wastewater rainwater separately wastewater sent sewage treatment plant rainwater sent directly river pathway sewage treatment plant environment different size small light emitted treated water runoff plant river heavier precipitate sewage sludge used agricultural soil amendment fertilizer landfill fact found agricultural soil sewage sludge applied originating sewage sludge could washed agricultural soil wind rain resulting spreading aquatic environment case artificial turf field could sent river rainwater spread soil sewage sludge via sewage treatment plant fiber artificial turf released sport field would also river sewage treatment plant contrast artificial turf fiber could enter river system treated water runoff float water release artificial turf field recognized european country installation artificial turf field japan increased field could become significant source aquatic environment considering european example vital take mitigation action sport field one possible way mitigate spread install device prevent migration ditch sewer pipe another option use natural product cork coir coconut-derived material olive seed infill sport field instead infills plant origin biodegradable thus would result even released environment however natural tip expensive durability natural tip field still unknown personal communication japanese company wild fish specie larger goldfish crucian carp could ingest natural environment goldfish study actively ingested artificial turf field even though considerable individual variation number ingested reason considerable variation unknown high ingestion rate observed larger goldfish probably larger fish strong suction power active ingestion goldfish would occur regardless manufacturer similar result two different company japanese company japanese company goldfish however goldfish may preference five-fold difference ingestion rate rts two company reason goldfish discriminated tgu icu unknown interestingly goldfish actively ingested without feed well feed result indicate ingestion accidental unintentional xiong demonstrated goldfish ingested polyethylene fragment presence fish feed study also reported ingestion rate different among shape color polyethylene fragment since artificial turf field round shape dark color unique softness goldfish could easily recognize food mummichog fundulus heteroclitus fathead minnow pimephales promelas exposed high dose tire crumb rubber 6.0 g/l seven day tire crumb rubber ingested fish accumulated intestine showed toxicity increased liver cytochrome p450-1a enzyme activity glutathione s-transferase activity although examine damage goldfish fish ingested large amount may cause intestinal obstruction similar study laplaca van den hurk present study also indicated high possibility wild fish ingest released aquatic environment short retention period ingested doe seem cause serious damage fish ingested study eliminated within two day goldfish examined although examine re-ingestion eliminated retention period comparable polyethylene fragment round shape softness could easier move digestive tract compared rough rigid polyethylene fragment however may long enough food web fish preyed predator conclusion present study demonstrated sport facility potential source marine artificial turf field could ingested fish released aquatic environment sport important activity educational social commercial point view development also essential human well-being similar
