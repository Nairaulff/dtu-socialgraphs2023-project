introduction mental retardation defined incomplete mental development lead fundamental limitation general mental ability intellectual performance adaptive behavior functional skill compared people age sex socio-cultural background limitation observed various aspect communication others personal care independence academic skill global prevalence disorder reported 10.37 people per people disorder either inherited acquired former merely responsible type mental retardation-related disorder world general beside associated problem ocular problem also reported affect child study show half mentally retarded child manifest ocular problem also reported ocular problem increase growing intensity mental retardation refractive error among common ocular problem individual corneal formation embryonic period influenced different gene therefore genetic problem human different consequence corneal morphology since genetics play significant role causing mental retardation also genetics effect morphology shape cornea possibility genetic problem cause difference corneal tomographic topographic index mentally retarded normal individual also due prevalence ocular problem individual corneal topography tomography index evaluated mentally retarded child usually cooperate properly subjective test therefore decision based objective finding nowadays modern imaging device used evaluate corneal health refractive power ass corneal topography tomography index index give detailed information surface cornea well layer used pre-surgical evaluation although previous study showed difference normal population individual syndrome term corneal index limited study regarding evaluation index mentally retarded child access corneal status subject necessary contact lens fitting well refractive surgery procedure hence great importance comprehensive information topographic tomographic condition cornea individual therefore aim current study compare anterior segment index mentally retarded normal child

conducted far according multiple gee model present study statistically significant difference corneal topographic tomographic parameter two group normal mentally retarded child however difference four parameter central corneal thickness corneal diameter anterior chamber depth iva index two group normal mentally retarded subject statistically significant noted result simple gee model different multiple model since multiple model considers variable control effect confounders valid result therefore discussion based multiple model result regarding observed change considering amount change compared standard deviation index mentioned parameter smaller number also change significant clinical point view said topographic tomographic feature cornea mentally challenged child significantly different normal people however discus point regarding difference found finding indicated cornea thicker mentally retarded group normal group child according study three similar study including study akinci cumurcu karadag reported thicker cornea mentally retarded child result current study consistent finding study term corneal thickness mentally retarded individual study also conducted involving patient syndrome including study hashemi alio karakucuk aslan evereklioglu reported difference corneal thickness table table comparison central corneal thickness child challenge normal full size table worth mentioning difference related amount corneal thickness similar study might due difference type disorder population ethnical racial discrepancy well measurement method instance study karadag corneal thickness evaluated using ultra-sonographic device whereas study pentacam device used purpose according study conducted date reason found justifying increase corneal thickness mentally retarded people study cumurcu statistically significant difference found corneal thickness two group cerebral palsy mental retardation cerebral palsy without mental retardation however study mentioned increase corneal thickness group combined cerebral palsy mental retardation might indicate mental retardation factor increasing central corneal thickness thicker cornea mentally retarded child study mostly cerebral palsy probably due fact normal growth development body disturbed cerebral palsy subsequently change corneal thickness also follow normal developmental course human corneal thickness decrease significantly first year life therefore disruption normal growth cornea cause cornea remain thicker people cerebral palsy observed difference corneal thickness corneal diameter anterior chamber depth iva index mentally retarted normal child clinically imply consideration taken screening glaucoma keratoconus mentally retarted child intraocular pressure corneal biomechanical index oct analysis optic nerve head mentally retarted child important relevant issue could topic future study addition aforementioned change variable value anterior chamber depth also higher mentally retarded child control group study conducted investigate index child cerebral palsy far seems genetic environmental factor effect parameter study warranted investigate particular issue mentioned iva index mentally retarded child significantly higher normal child hashemi stated best index detecting keratoconus iva index value higher 0.2 micron considered indicator keratokonus study average iva index mentally retarded people equal 0.25 micron indicates presence subclinical keratoconus since rest indicator diagnosing keratoconus present individual seems increase iva index people may due structural change cornea doe indicate ectatic change cornea future study recommended use corneal biomechanical index along corneal irregularity index detect keratoconus nevertheless screening keratoconus recommended mentally retarded child considering higher iva corneal diameter i.e limbus limbus diameter mentally retarded child statistically significantly higher normal child however clinical point view difference significant 0.1 .indeed lack axial length data doe allow make correct judgment regard study needed matter since index corneal diameter important clinical measure prescribing contact lens general justify significant difference mentioned index might two possible explanation first reason mentally retarded child study mostly cerebral palsy since natural growth development body disturbed cerebral palsy induce effect natural growth development eye component mean structure cornea anterior chamber etc. likely undergo change examining anatomical dimension eye people seems interesting topic considering hypothesis difference corneal thickness anterior chamber depth iva index corneal diameter justified extent second reason cited existence genetic background development cerebral palsy probably genetic factor also affect ocular structure according study approximately cerebral palsy etiology genetic problem genetic background also play important role creating change cornea ocular structure current study attempt made examine important corneal topography tomography index mentally retarded child however study also limitation child cerebral palsy also considered mentally retarded included category taking account intraocular pressure iop corneal biomechanical index lack diversity disorder mentally retarded group among limitation study according result present study child higher keratoconus index central keratoconus index index height asymmetry index height decentration compared without addition case moderate mental retardation higher index surface variance index vertical asymmetry index height asymmetry index height decentration mild mental retardation ocular problem vision disorder strabismus retinal problem already received attention child finding indicates necessity attention child child severe mental retardation term keratoconus indicator recommended child regular visit keratoconus workup finally suggested future study three group cerebral palsy syndrome normal people compared addition index used current study intraocular pressure corneal biomechanics also considered finding study showed anterior segment index different mentally retarded compared normal child moreover keratoconus indicator worse child child higher grade mental retardation important consider keratoconus screening child
