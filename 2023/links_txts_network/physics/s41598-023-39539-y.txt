Introduction Hybrid nanofluids are colloidal mixtures containing two type of nanoparticles mixed in a single base fluid. These fluids are useful in applications where heat and mass transfer enhancement is required to obtain more efficient and effective systems. Hybrid nanofluids especially with different shapes of nanoparticles can further improve the heat transfer effects due to which their study has gained interest of many researchers.

Recently, Prasannakumara 25 investigated the influence of porous media on methanol and NaAlg based nanofluid flow through Tiwari-Das model. Ragupathi et al. in 26 explored radiative Casson nanofluid over a radially stretching and rotating disk. Many applications of rotating disks involve heat generation and absorption phenomena in order to perform the task optimally. It can either require higher temperatures or extremely lower temperatures depending on the phenomena under consideration. For instance, in order to separate platelets and other components from blood rotation, an ambient temperature must be maintained in order to achieve the desired results. Different studies in literature have taken heat source/sink into account.

Dinarvand et al. 37 performed a numerical investigation on squeezing flow of a water based hybrid nanofluid between two collateral sheets influenced by heat generation and absorption. Entropy generation is the useful energy dissipated in the environment and it results in reduced efficiency of engineering systems and biological processes.

The focus of current study is entropy analysis, and modeling of heat and mass transfer in a blood based unsteady hybrid nanofluid with radium and alumina nanoparticles having various shapes including spherical, brick, platelet and cylindrical through Hamilton-Crosser model. The nanoparticles of current study are important in enhancing heat and mass transfer properties of blood which is useful in many applications of medical industry including drug transport, cancer treatment and centrifuging blood to obtain its components (platelets, red and white blood cells). The flow is simulated with slip boundary conditions and fluid rotation between double rotating disks. The flow is also influenced by magnetic field, porous medium and heat sink/source. Using appropriate transforms modeled equations are converted to system of nonlinear ODEs. The solution method adopted is a semi-analytical approach namely, homotopy analysis method (HAM). The series form solution obtained with this method are validated through mean square errors and convergence table. Moreover, solutions obtained through HAM are also compared with Runge-Kutta 4th order solutions to provide further validation of results. The nanofluid flow in radial axial and tangential directions is graphically analyzed. Fluid temperature and concentration is simulated against pertinent fluid parameters. Entropy generation is presented numerically and graphically. In rest of the article, mathematical formulation is given in Section “ Mathematical Formulation ,” solution methodology is presented in Section “ Proposed Methodology with Convergence Analysis ,” results are simulated graphically and discussed in Section “ Results and Discussion ” and finally major conclusions drawn from this study are given in Section “ Conclusion ”. Mathematical formulation The flow geometry consists of double rotating disks with cylindrical coordinated \((r,\theta ,z)\) and blood based hybrid nanofluid which contains Radium Rd and alumina \(Al_2O_3\) nanoparticles.

In Eqs. ( 26 ), ( 27 ), we assume that \(\mathcal {E}\) is much smaller when compared to the cross product \(\mathcal {V}\times \mathcal {B}\) . Moreover, we assume that the product \(\mathcal {Q}\mathcal {V}\) is also negligible in comparison to \(\mathcal {J}\) . By applying the above assumptions and using Eq. ( 27 ) in Eq. ( 26 ), we obtain the final local entropy expression as $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \mathfrak {S}_{gen}=\frac{k_{hnf}}{T_m^2}\left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\right) ^2+\frac{\mu _{hnf}}{T_m}\left[ \frac{1}{k_0}(u^2)+2\left\{ \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right) ^2+\frac{u^2}{r^2}+\left( \frac{\partial w}{\partial z}\right) ^2\right\} \right. \\ \left. +\left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}\right) ^2+\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right) ^2+\left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial r}-\frac{v}{r}\right) ^2\right] +\frac{\sigma _{hnf}}{T_m}(u^2+v^2)B_0^2, \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (28) We use the similarity transforms from Eq. ( 17 ) in above Eq. ( 28 ) to obtain the non-dimensional expression of the entropy generation given below $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \mathcal {N}_g=\alpha \theta '^2+Br Re\left( 12 F'^2+\frac{F'^2}{Da}\right) +Br(G'^2+F''^2)+M\frac{\chi _{1}}{\chi _{2}}Br(G^2+F'^2), \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (29) where $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \mathcal {N}_g=\frac{\mathfrak {S}_{gen}\nu _f T_m}{k_{hnf}\Omega \nabla T},\, \alpha =\frac{\nabla T}{T_m},\, Br=\frac{\mu _{hnf}\Omega ^2 r^2}{k_{hnf}\nabla T (1-bt)^2},\, Re=\nu _f\frac{\Omega }{r^2}, \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (30) here \(\mathcal {N}_g\) is th entropy generation rate, \(\alpha\) is the dimensionless temperature difference, Br is the Brinkman number and Re the Reynolds number. Entropy generation and optimization is much important for scientist. One such number, which is much important in understanding physical aspects of irreversibility is Bejan number. It is the ratio of entropy generation through thermal irreversibility to the total entropy. Bejan number in this study is as follows $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} Be=\frac{\alpha \theta '^2}{\mathcal {N}_g}. \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (31) We observe that Bejan number lies in domain [0,1]. When \(Be=1\) the entropy generation is dominated by the thermal irreversibility effects and for \(Be=1/2\) heat transfer effects equal to the sum of fluid friction and Joule dissipation irreversibility. Proposed methodology with convergence analysis In order to present basic methodology we consider following system as $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \mathcal {L}_{i}[\Upsilon _{i}(\eta )]+\mathcal {N}_{i}[\Upsilon _{i}(\eta )]-g_{i}(\eta )=0,\\ B_{i}\left( \Upsilon _{i},\frac{d^{n}\Upsilon _{i}}{d\eta ^{n}}\right) =0, \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (32) where i is the index such that \(i=1(1)4\) while \(\Upsilon _{i}\) and \(g_{i}\) are unknown and known functions. \(\eta\) is the independent variable. Firstly, construct homotopies as 57 , 58 $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} (1-\breve{q})\mathcal {L}_{i}[\Upsilon _{i}(\eta ;\breve{q})-\Upsilon _{i0}(\eta )]=\hbar _{i}\breve{q}H(\eta )\mathcal {N}_{i}[\Upsilon _{i}(\eta ;\breve{q})], \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (33) where $$\begin{aligned} \Upsilon _{i}(\eta ;0)=\Upsilon _{i0}(\eta ), \end{aligned}$$ (34) and $$\begin{aligned} \Upsilon _{i}(\eta ;1)=\Upsilon _{i}(\eta ), \end{aligned}$$ (35) Now we expand the unknown function \(\Upsilon _{i}(\eta ;q)\) into a power series of \(\breve{q}\) , $$\begin{aligned} \Upsilon _{i}(\eta ;\breve{q})=\Upsilon _{i0}(\eta )+\sum _{m=1}^{+\infty }\Upsilon _{im}(\eta )\breve{q}^{m}, \end{aligned}$$ (36) and $$\begin{aligned} \Upsilon _{im}(\eta )=\left. \frac{1}{m!}\frac{\partial \Upsilon _{i}(\eta ;\breve{q})}{\partial \breve{q}^{m}}\right| _{\breve{q}=0}, \end{aligned}$$ (37) In order to obtain the \(m\text {-}th\) order deformation, we use Eq. ( 36 ) in Eq. ( 33 ) and get the following $$\begin{aligned} \mathcal {L}_{i}[\Upsilon _{im}(\eta )-\varkappa _{im}\Upsilon _{i(m-1)}(\eta )]=\hbar _{i}H_{i}(\eta )\mathcal {Q}_{im}(\eta ), \end{aligned}$$ (38) here $$\begin{aligned} \mathcal {Q}_{im}(\eta )=\frac{1}{(m-1)!}\left. \frac{\partial ^{m-1}\mathcal {N}_{i}[\Upsilon _{i}(\eta ;\breve{q})]}{\partial \breve{q}^{m-1}}\right| _{q=0}, \end{aligned}$$ (39) and $$\begin{aligned} \varkappa _{im}={\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0, \text {when }m\le 1,\\ 1, \text {when }m\ge 2, \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$ (40) In case of Eqs. ( 18 )–( 21 ), the initial guesses and linear operators are as follows $$\begin{aligned} \begin{aligned} \mathcal {L}_{F}=\frac{\partial ^3 F}{\partial \eta ^3},\, \mathcal {L}_{G}=\frac{\partial ^2 G}{\partial \eta ^2},\, \mathcal {L}_{\theta }=\frac{\partial ^2 \theta }{\partial \eta ^2},\, \mathcal {L}_{\phi }=\frac{\partial ^2 \phi }{\partial \eta ^2},\\ F_{0}(\eta )=\frac{\zeta _{1} x^2+\zeta _{2} x^2+2 \zeta _{1} x+2 \zeta _{2} \delta x}{2 (\delta +1)},\, G_{0}(\eta )=1-\eta ,\, \phi _{0}(\eta )=1-\eta , \, \theta _{0}(\eta )=1-\eta . \end{aligned} \end{aligned}$$ (41) The m - th order series form solutions can be obtained by adding initial guesses with the special functions obtained through Eq. ( 38 ) for \(i=1,2,3\) and 4, respectively. Convergence analysis of proposed methodology The convergence of series solution is determined through \(\hbar\) -curves of the system. \(\hbar\) -curves provide interval of convergence graphically. The combined \(\hbar\) -curves for \(F,G,\theta\) and \(\phi\) are plotted at \(28^{th}\) order in Fig. 2 . Moreover, after fixing values of fluid parameters and \(\hbar\) (chosen from the region of convergence), series form solutions are presented in Table 3 . It is noted that solutions converged at \(23^{rd}\) , \(29^{th}\) till \(51^{st}\) order, all correct up to 6 decimal places. Convergence is also shown in Fig. 3 where means square errors are plotted against order of approximation. Furthermore, in Table 4 HAM solutions at \(4^{th}\) order are also compared with numerical solutions obtained through Runge-Kutta 4th order method for different values of \(\eta\) and it is noted that both solutions are same upto fourth decimal.

Velocity profile Radial, axial and tangential velocities are presented against pertinent fluid parameters in Figs. 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . Increase in magnetic interaction parameter increases the radial and axial velocities in Fig. 4 a and b. Magnetic parameter being inversely related to the fluid density, increases the blood flow as base fluid density decreases. The unsteady parameter \(\mathbb {B}\) decreases, the radial tangential and axial velocity in Fig. 5 a–c, respectively. Increase in unsteady parameter decreases the disk rotation, resulting in decreased fluid flow. In Figs. 6 a and b, increase in the Darcy number Da decreases the radial and axial velocity.Larger Darcy number results in increased viscous forces among fluid layers that causes resistance to fluid flow in radial and axial directions. Increase in stretching parameters \(\zeta _{1}\) and \(\zeta _{2}\) increases fluid velocity in radial and axial direction, whereas a decrease in fluid flow is observed tangentially (see Figs. 7 and 8 ). Increase in both \(\zeta _{1}\) and \(\zeta _{2}\) is increasing the stretching motion of disk in u -direction and decreasing the rotation of disk in \(\theta\) -direction which offers increased flow in radially and axially while decreasing it in tangential direction. In Fig. 9 , increase in slip parameter \(\lambda\) , increases the fluid velocity in all directions as resistance to flow decreases. Figure 4 Effect of magnetic field on radial and axial velocity.

Full size image Temperature profile Change in fluid temperature is observed in Figs. 10 a–d in case of brick, cylinder and platelet shaped nanoparticles comparatively. As seen in Fig. 10 a, higher values of Prandtl number Pr increases the fluid temperature due to elevated thermal diffusivity. Increase in heat source \(H_{s}\) increases the temperature of nanofluid in Fig. 10 b. Moreover, increase in volume fraction of radium nanoparticles \(\varphi _{Rd}\) and alumina nanoparticles \(\varphi _{Al}\) decreases the blood temperature in Fig. 10 c and d. It is observed that brick shape case shown the highest while platelet shape case shown the lowest temperature throughout the paper.

Full size image Concentration profile Concentration of blood nanofluid against unsteady parameter \(\mathbb {B}\) , Schmidt number \(\mathcal {S}_{c}\) and nanoparticle volume fractions \(\varphi _{Rd}\) and \(\varphi _{Al}\) is presented in Fig. 11 . In Fig. 11 a, higher values of unsteady parameter increases the blood concentration. Increase in Schmidt number \(\mathcal {S}_{c}\) decreases the concentration of blood hybrid nanofluid in Fig. 11 b. Schmidt number is the ratio between momentum diffusivity an mass diffusivity in a fluid flow. So, higher values of Schmidt number correspond to more diffusion through momentum, resulting in lower concentration of the nanofluid. Increasing the volume fractions of both radium and alumina decreases the blood concentration in Figs. 11 c and d, respectively. Figure 11 Concentration profile against various fluid parameters. Full size image Entropy generation and Bejan number Entropy and Bejan number are plotted side by side in Figs. 12 , 13 and entropy optimization is numerically analyzed in Table 5 . Increase in magnetic interaction parameter M in Fig. 12 a increases entropy and Bejan number shows inverse behavior in Fig. b. As M increases the resistance in fluid flow increases due to the Lorentz forces and disorderedness of system increases. Increase in volume fraction of radium and alumina increases entropy while Bejan number behaves oppositely (see Figs. 12 c–f). Higher Brinkman number Br increases entropy as seen in Fig. 13 a and Bejan number is decreased in contrast in Fig. 13 b. In c increase in Reynolds number Re elevates entropy generation as higher values of Reynolds number results in more turbulent flow due to which system becomes more disordered. Bejan number on the other hand shows opposite behavior in Fig. 13 d. It is evident from Fig. 13 e and f that spherical shaped nanoparticles offer highest entropy while platelet shaped nanoparticles offer lowest entropy in hybrid nanofluid flow. Bejan number in Fig. 13 f depicts similar behavior. In Table 5 numerically minimized entropy is calculated for variable values of \(\hbar\) and volume fractions \(\varphi _{1}\) and \(\varphi _{2}\) along with optimal values of all other fluid parameters required to achieve minimum entropy. In case of \(\hbar\) , minimum entropy is achieved when \(\hbar =-0.6\) . Overall, the minimum entropy in blood hybrid nanofluid is obtained to be zero when volume fraction of radium nanoparticles is \(2\%\) and that of alumina is \(1\%\) while keeping \(\hbar =-0.6\) .

Full size table Skin friction, Nusselt and Sherwood number In Figs. 14 and 15 we present skin friction, heat and mass transfer in form of contours and 3D plots. Moreover, comparative heat transfer rate is also presented in a 2D plot for different shapes of nanoparticles in Fig. 16 . Skin friction of hybrid blood nanofluid increases with increase in Reynolds number Re and volume fraction of radium nanoparticles \(\varphi _{Rd}\) as depicted in Fig. 14 a. It is evident from the contour plot that increase in skin friction with respect to Re is much more significant when compared to increase caused by volume fraction \(\varphi _{Rd}\) . Increase in nanoparticle concentration of radium and alumina results in elevated heat transfer rate in Fig. 14 b. This increase in heat transfer is more prominent when alumina nanoparticles \(\varphi _{Al}\) are increased as compared to radium nanoparticles. The reason of higher heat transfer caused by alumina is due to higher thermal conductivity of \(Al_{2}O_{3}\) than Rd as given in Table 2 . Mass transfer rate in Fig. 14 c decreases as \(\varphi _{Rd}\) and \(\varphi _{Al}\) increases. Both stretching parameters \(\zeta _{1}\) and \(\zeta _{2}\) are plotted simultaneously against skin friction in a 3D plot presented in Fig. 15 a. Increase in \(\zeta _{1}\) increases the skin friction of nanofluid with the disk surface while \(\zeta _{2}\) first decreases the skin friction till \(\zeta _{2}=5.4\) and then increases onward. In Fig. 15 b Reynolds number Re and Prandtl number Pr are presented against Nusselt number. Increase in Re decreases the heat transfer rate while increase in Pr increases the heat transfer rate in blood nanofluid. Maximum heat transfer is seen at a corner peak with highest Pr and lowest Re . Increase in Re and Schmidt number \(\mathcal {S}_{c}\) is depicted in Fig. 15 c for Sherwood number. Higher values of Re decreases the rate of mass transfer substantially. Furthermore, rate of heat transfer for various nanoparticle shapes is shown in Fig. 16 . Platelet shaped nanoparticles offer highest heat transfer rate while spherical shape of nanoparticles offer lowest rate of heat transfer.

Full size image Conclusion The objective of current manuscript is modeling and computation of entropy generation and optimization in hybrid nanofluid with different nanoparticle shape factors. The base fluid in current study is blood while the two nanoparticles are radium Rd and alumina \(Al_{2}O_{3}\) . The blood flow is simulated between two rotating and stretching disk with porous medium and slip effects at the boundaries. The system of non-linear ordinary differential equations of this fluid model is solved through a novel semi analytical approach namely, homotopy analysis method (HAM). The series form solution obtained through HAM is tested for convergence and error analysis. The series solution is convergent from the 23rd order of approximation onward and the errors are as low as \(10^{-19}\) at 35th order of approximation. Velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are analyzed through 2D plots. Entropy generation is analyzed numerically and graphically for various parameters. Moreover, skin friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are studied through contour and 3D plots for better understanding and presentation purpose. Major results of the investigation are: Fluid velocity decreases in all directions (radial, axial and tangential) with increase in unsteady parameter \(\mathbb {B}\) and Darcy number Da . Both stretching parameters \(\zeta _{1}\) and \(\zeta _{2}\) elevate the velocity profile in radial and axial directions whereas tangential velocity shows opposite results. Increase in slip parameter \(\lambda\) increases velocity in axial, radial and tangential directions. Temperature increases with higher values of Prandtl number Pr and heat source \(H_{s}\) while opposite behavior is observed with increase in \(\varphi _{Rd}\) and \(\varphi _{Al}\) . Overall temperature of the fluid is highest in case of brick shaped nanoparticles whereas platelet shape nanoparticles result in lowest fluid temperature. Concentration of blood hybrid nanofluid increases with higher values of unsteady parameter \(\mathbb {B}\) while decrease in fluid concentration is recorded with increase in Schmidt number \(\mathcal {S}_{c}\) and nanoparticle volume fractions. Entropy generation increases with increase in magnetic parameter M , volume fractions \(\varphi _{Rd}\) , \(\varphi _{Al}\) , Brinkman number Br and Reynolds number Re whereas Bejan number behaves in contrast. Spherical shaped nanoparticles result in highest entropy while the platelet shaped nanoparticles offer lowest entropy. The most optimal value of entropy is obtained to be zero when \(\hbar =-0.6\) , \(\varphi _{Rd}=2\%\) and \(\varphi _{Al}=1\%\) . Skin friction of nanofluid with wall elevates with higher values of Reynolds number Re , volume fraction \(\varphi _{Rd}\) , stretching parameters \(\zeta _{1}\) and \(\zeta _{2}\) . Mass transfer decreases with increase in both volume fractions \(\varphi _{Rd}\) , \(\varphi _{Al}\) and Reynolds number Re . Heat transfer in the fluid is highest in case of platelet shaped nanoparticles and lowest in case of spherical shaped nanoparticles. This study can be further carried out in future by fractional modeling for various nanofluid models in both Buongiorno and two phase cases.
