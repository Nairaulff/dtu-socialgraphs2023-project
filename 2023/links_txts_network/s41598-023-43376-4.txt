These results highlight the effectiveness of the IMCN algorithm based on CRO in enhancing the coverage of UWSNs. Upon further analysis of these findings, a noteworthy disparity becomes apparent in the coverage achieved by distinct optimization algorithms for constructing UWSNs. While SAAN and PSAN exhibit competitiveness in the initial phase, their performance progressively lags behind other algorithms. Notably, the networks established through the utilization of GAN, ACAN, and IMCN algorithms exhibit steadily enhanced coverage as the number of iterations increases. As depicted in Fig. 8 , the data transmission success rate of network models constructed using different optimization algorithms exhibits an increasing trend with increased model iterations. Notably, when the number of iterations reaches 600, the success rate of data transmission based on GAN is 66.13%, ACAN achieves a success rate of 70.44%, while IMCN attains an impressive success rate of 95.35%. Thus, it can be concluded that with an increase in the number of model iterations, the data transmission success rate of network models constructed using various optimization algorithms gradually improves. However, the IMCN model based on the CRO algorithm outperforms others in terms of data transmission success rate. Upon further analysis of these findings, it becomes evident that distinct optimization algorithms yield significantly varying performance outcomes in the context of network models, specifically with respect to data transmission efficacy. Notably, the models formulated through the GAN and ACAN algorithms manifest relatively modest transmission success rates in their early stages. Yet, these rates exhibit a gradual improvement as the number of model iterations increases.

Full size image Figure 10 The network throughput data trend of the underwater wireless sensor model constructed by different optimization algorithms. Full size image As depicted in Fig. 9 , the probability of failure in UWSN models constructed using various optimization algorithms decreases notably as the number of model iterations increases. For instance, when the model iteration count reaches 600, the failure probability for the GAN-based network is 23.25%, the ACAN-based network exhibits a failure probability of 16.34%, and the IMCN-based network demonstrates a significantly lower failure probability of 2.42%. In conjunction with the experimental findings, these results confirm that the IMCN model based on the CRO algorithm outperforms other models by showcasing a superior performance with a lower probability of failure. The alteration of fault outage probability within the UWSN models fashioned by distinct algorithms becomes apparent as time elapses or other factors come into play. By juxtaposing the fault interruption probabilities within UWSN models crafted by diverse algorithms, their relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of fault handling capacity can be assessed. Thus, the IMCN algorithm emerges as efficacious in curtailing the failure likelihood within UWSN models.

At 100 iterations, the GAN algorithm achieves a network throughput of 20.47 bit/s, the ACAN algorithm achieves 37.24 bit/s, the PSAN algorithm achieves 55.27 bit/s, the CNNN algorithm achieves 76.23 bit/s, the SAAN algorithm achieves 101.81 bit/s, and the IMCN algorithm achieves the highest network throughput of 124.47 bit/s. At 600 iterations, the IMCN algorithm reaches its peak performance with a network throughput of 174.94 bit/s, surpassing the other algorithms that exhibit limited effects. The superior performance of the IMCN algorithm can be attributed to its ability to adapt to the complex underwater environment, enhance sensor node coverage, and improve network reliability.
