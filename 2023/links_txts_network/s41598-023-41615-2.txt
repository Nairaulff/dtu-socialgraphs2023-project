Introduction The waste minimization of agriculture waste takes the attention of most scientists due to the presence of cellulosic bone which has chains comprised β(1 → 4) linked to D-glucose 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and have different hydrogen bonding interactions, that are active in biological estimation for instance bio adhesive drug delivery systems 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 . Furthermore, Lung tumor is one of the maximum popular cancers internationally, and it is disturbing in males and females 9 , 10 . Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is an important molecular cascade in modified embryonic development and adult homeostasis 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . However, it has been implicated in multiple human malignancies, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, due to dysregulation 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 . Beta-catenin is one of a big and complicated array of proteins which it's involved in the control of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway 18 , 19 . Also, the dissociation of beta-catenin from this destruction complex outcomes in the aggregation of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus, which activates the target genes of the Wnt pathway, such as cyclin D1, MMP7, and c-Myc in human cancers 20 , 21 . In this elucidation, we synthesized the novel pyrazole cellulosic compounds from the reaction of condensation with cellulose aldehyde with active CN-uracil acetamide to give the corresponding cellulose arylidene MDAU(4). This compound can then be easily cyclized in the presence of nitrogen nucleophiles like hydrazine hydrate to give the pyrazole cellulosic derivative MDAP(5), which was confirmed through spectral analysis. Additionally, we examined these cellulosic derivatives with cytotoxic effects on lung cancer cells (A549) and colon cancer cells (Caco2), and we then examined the levels of -Catenin, Myc, Cyclin D1, and MMP7 gene expression in A549 cells. The heterocyclic cellulosic compounds were also docked with the PDBID: 2ito, 1nun, 5jsn, and 5vzu, respectively. Additionally, the cellulosic compounds were improved utilized the DFT/B3LYP/6-311(G) basis set, which demonstrated the stability of the compounds as a result of the interaction of the NH and OH of cellulose, uracil, and pyrazole in electrostatic hydrogen bonds 14 , 22 , 23 , 24 . Experimental section Apparatus The Shimadzu FT-IR 8101 PC infrared spectrophotometer recorded the IR spectra. The 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were determined in DMSO-d 6 at 300 MHz on a Varian Mercury VX 300 NMR spectrometer ( 1 H at 300 MHz, 13 C at 75 MHz) exhausting trimethyl silane as an internal typical. Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) were investigated utilizing JEOL JXA-840A electron probe Microanalyzer Company and were air-dried before imaging, and images were obtained using an accelerating voltage of 10–15 kV. In closed vessels under pressure, microwave-irradiated Pyrex tubes with caps were used to conduct the reactions. Reagent Microcrystalline cellulose (20 μm) was obtained from the Rasyan research laboratory, and NaIO4 was ordered from Fluka. EtOH, NH 2 NH 2 , triethyl amine, purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company. 2-cyano- N -(2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidin-5-yl)acetamide(3) was synthesized according previous procedure 25 . Synthesis of cellulose aldehyde MDAC(2) Using a microwave device, cellulose was oxidized to various degrees of oxidation with NaOI4 (20 ml). At 3, 1, and 1.5 min, the precursor was transferred to the microwave to finish the oxidation process. The oxidized product was filtered, EtOH washed, and allowed to dry for a whole night at room temperature. Using 1.5 g of cellulose and 20 ml of distilled water, aldehyde concentration was determined 26 , through the basic response of Schiff. NH 2 OH.HCl is used when aldehyde groups transform into oximes. Dialdehyde cellulose, 0.3 g, was dispersed in 20 ml of pH-5 NaOH solution-containing water, then, NH 2 OH.HCl (0.72 mol/l) was added at pH 5 for 4 hours, the mixture was stimulated at 40 °C. To titrate the emitted HCl, a 1.0 M aqueous NaOH solution was used. The volume of alkali solution consumed during the titration was recorded (in liters), and the amount of NaOH consumed when the pH value of the solution reached 5.0 was validated. The volume of 1.0 M sodium hydroxide solution consumed was measured as Vc (in liters), using the same concentration of cellulose solution at pH 5.0 as a blank. The following equation is used to designate the aldehyde content (% w/w) 27 , 28 . $$\begin{aligned} & {-}CHO + {\text{NH}}_{{2}} {\text{OH}} \to {-}{\text{CHNOH}} + {\text{HCL}} + {\text{H}}_{2} {\text{O}} \\ & {\text{HCL}} + {\text{NaOH}} \to {\text{NaCL}} + {\text{H}}_{{2}} {\text{O}} \\ \end{aligned}$$ $$Aldehyde \, content\left( \% \right)t = \frac{{{\text{C}}({\text{NaOH}}) \cdot Va - VC}}{{8\;{\text{mM}}}}$$ where C NaOH = 1.0 M, m is the dry weight of DAC (0.3 g) used in the experiment, and M molecular weight of the repeating unit of cellulose (162).

Full size image Biological activities Anti-cancer activity Uracil pyrazole cellulose compound was investigated on the cell growth from two tumor cells ( A549 and Caco2 ) at (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µM) concentrations via neutral red uptake analysis which is constructed on the ability of viable cells to include and bind the supravitally dye neutral red in the lysosomes. Doxorubicin (Dox) was used as a standard drug with IC 50 values of 4.8 and 22.5 µM against tested cells (A549 and Caco2 respectively). The use of DMSO as a solvent had an insignificant effect on the viability of A549 and Caco2 cells when preserved for 48 h.

Molecular studies The A549 cells preserved with uracil pyrazole cellulose MDAC(2), MDAU(4), MDAP(5) on mRNA expression levels β-Catenin, Myc, Cyclin D1, and MMP7 genes were estimated utilizing IC 50 standards of these heterocycles later 2 days and were estimated through calculating the percentage of its expression to that of β-Actin and in comparison to control values. From earlier analysis, it is fit recognized that the expression levels of β-Catenin, Myc, Cyclin D1, and MMP7 are up-regulated in A549 cells 48 , 49 . The Wnt signaling pathway is a complex pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation 50 . The abnormal excitation of the pathway due to genetic mutation or increased stability can activate the abnormal expression of downstream target genes, including, Myc, Cyclin, and MMP-7, which can lead to cell proliferation, inhibition of cell apoptosis, and tumor formation 51 . Canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway stimulates gene transcription through β-catenin 48 , 52 . MYC proto-oncogene amplification is closely related to tumor formation, development, and metastasis and is highly expressed in cervical cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, and other tumors 41 . Cyclin D1 considerably contributed to the development of the G1 to S phase 10 , 53 . The previous studies showed that the MMP-7 expression has been closely associated with tumor invasion and metastasis 5 , 10 , 41 , 54 . The current results showed that doxorubicin decreased significantly the expression levels of β-Catenin, Cyclin D1, and MMP7 genes in A549 cells as compared to control values (Fig. 8 ). On the other hand, treatment of A549 cells with compounds MDAC(2) and MDAP(5) resulted in a significant reduction in levels of MMP7 and c-MYC genes in comparison with control values. Besides, compound MDAU(4) exhibited a significant reduction in levels of β-Catenin, Myc, Cyclin D1, and MMP7 genes in A549 cells compared to control values (Fig. 8 ). From obtained results, we found that compound MDAU(4) is the most promising anticancer agent against A549 cancer cells through the reduction of expression levels of β-Catenin, Myc, Cyclin D1, and MMP7 genes compared to control values 41 , 50 .

Full size image Moreover, the uracil heterocycles exhibited the non-planarity with DFT/B3LYP/6-311(G) level, and MDAC(2) showed total energy of it was (− 18,653.3596 eV)(− 430,156.581 kcal/mol) with coplanarity of two carbonyl group in glycoside ring and they were far of each other and blinded with each other with hydrogen bonds which make the band energy gap with ∆E = 3.97262 eV and this high gap gave the aldehyde stability and ability to interact again with other compound and as demonstrated in Fig. 10 A,B the delocalization of electrons in HOMO and LUMO were in all MDAC(2) and indicate of reactivity of it. Furthermore, the dipole moment of MDAC(2) showed that 2.9272D can simply for energy departure and provided it capability to react once more, its electronegativity which designated the affinity of an atom to cooperate with mutual pair of electrons exhibited a high value of 3.832 eV and its hardness and softness showed low value with 1.986 eV and 0.503; respectively and it due to ability to change its electron cloud surrounding the HC=O of aldehyde group. The Pi chemical potential of MDAC(2) gives it the capability to respond and captivate more energy in dissimilar temperature varieties and they presented − 3.832 eV which gave them the capability to accumulate energy inside it. ω indicated electrophilic attractiveness and electron flow between donor and acceptor so, the MDAC(2) exhibited higher electrophilic attractiveness to captivate electrons with 3.696 eV 65 , 66 , Additionally, the energy of the cellulosic compound MDAU(4) is more stable than MDAC(2) with (− 37,095.0520509 eV)( − 855,432.003784 kcal/mol) due to the presence of the uracil moiety connected to MDAC(2) and more NH groups, which increase the stability of the molecule 35 , 42 . This is demonstrated in Fig. 9 C,D. Additionally, FMO represents electron affinity and ionization potential. Additionally, the heterocycle's stability and reactivity were determined by the band gap energy. While heterocycles with a smaller band gap will be less stable and more reactive, those with a larger band gap will be more stable 67 , 68 , 69 , According to Fig. 9 B, the HOMO–LUMO orbitals' energy planes and circulations were computed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d, p) level for the complex MDAU(4) on the glucose and uracil moiety in HOMO and LUMO due to more NH and OH groups, which provided it stability with a gap energy of 3.39029 eV. With a dipole moment of 12.1785D, this compound has a high dipole attraction that makes charge separation simple. Due to the presence of CN–CH=, which gives an atom the ability to respond again, practical MDAU(4) displayed a high value of 4.451 eV for its electronegativity, and similarly, the (eV) can easily change the electron charge with − 4.451 eV can be easily to store more energy inside it 70 , 71 , 72 , 73 . Due to the formation of pyrazole attached to cellulose with (− 39,037.179122 eV)( − 900,218.50658 kcal/mol), its HOMO–LUMO delocalization of charge on pyrazole and uracil rings and lack of delocalization on OH group of glycose ring, as well as the presence of NH and carbonyl of pyrazole uracil, the MDAP(5) demonstrated greater stability than MDAU(4), gave it stability, its band energy gap was 0.95948 eV, and the charge energy departure of its dipole moment was 2.5425D. As a result, the MDAP(5) displayed high electrophilic attractiveness with 6.980 eV and electronic charge ΔN max with 5.39 eV due to more NH and NH 2 , which increased the electronic charge 74 , 75 on it as shown in Table .5 and Fig. 10 (E, F). Conclusion In this elucidation, the cellulosic aldehyde was combined with uracil acetamide to produce the corresponding arylidene cellulosic derivatives, which served as the active site for the nucleophilic addition to give the corresponding pyrazole cellulosic derivative. These heterocycles were then confirmed through various analyses, and it was discovered that more hydrogen bond interactions caused the binding to occur on the cellulosic surface. Additionally, the tested compound MDAU(4) displayed the lowest IC 50 values and the largest cytotoxic activity against A549 and Caco2 cells in comparison to the beginning compound MDAC(2) 47 . The Wnt genes (-Catenin, Myc, Cyclin D1, and MMP7) are likewise expressed at lower levels in A549 cells after 48 h. Additionally, the docking stimulation revealed that MDAU(4) had an excellent binding affinity for the majority of proteins with the least amount of energy required due to the presence of more NH and OH in its structure. These findings were further supported by the physical descriptors of these cellulosic compounds, which demonstrated the stability of these compounds due to increased hydrogen bonding interaction.
