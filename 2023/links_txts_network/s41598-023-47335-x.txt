Introduction Iron is a key nutrient for almost all microorganisms. It is required for bacterial metabolism, growth, and survival 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Paradoxically, this essential nutrient shows extremely low solubility (Ksp = 10 –18 M) under aerobic conditions and at neutral pH, which severely limits its bioavailability 5 . Consequently, iron limitation is a state that microorganisms very often experience and in many ecosystems, the low availability of iron generates fierce competition between them. To overcome iron restriction, many microorganisms synthesize and secrete siderophores, low molecular weight ligands that have a very high affinity for ferric iron (Fe 3+ ) 6 . The biological function of siderophores is to scavenge iron in the environment of bacteria and bring it into the bacterial. In Gram-negative bacteria, the uptake of ferri-siderophore complexes across the outer membrane involves TonB-dependent transporters (TBDT) 7 . The energy necessary for the uptake process of ferri-siderophores by these transporters is provided by the inner membrane proton motive force via the inner membrane protein TonB 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 . TonB forms a molecular motor with two other membrane proteins, ExbB and ExbD, that are able to transfer the energy generated by the proton motive force to the TBDT located in the outer membrane. Many X-ray structures of TBDTs have been published 7 , 14 , 15 , 16 . All are composed of a β-barrel of 22 β-strands interacting with the lipids of the outer membrane and contain very large extracellular loops. The lumen of the barrel is filled by a globular domain called the plug. The N-terminal end of the transporter is periplasmic and contains a 5 to 8 amino acid conserved domain called the TonB box, which is essential for interaction with the TonB protein 8 , 17 , 18 , 19 . All TBDTs have a binding site localized on the plug composed of residues of the plug and the extracellular loops 7 . After binding of the ferri-siderophore complex to its binding site on the plug domain, the TonB box of the TBDT interacts with the periplasmic part of the TonB protein providing the energy necessary to obtain formation of a channel in the transporter and the uptake of ferri-siderophore complexes through the outer membrane 8 , 12 , 13 , 17 , 18 , 19 . Ferri-enterobactin TBDTs, PfeA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and FepA in Escherichia coli , have an additional binding site for ferri-siderophore complexes localized in the extracellular loops of the barrel 15 , 20 . In this case, ferri-enterobactin likely first binds to this binding site before migrating to the binding site on the plug domain. P. aeruginosa is a ubiquitous microorganism known for its high adaptability to a large range of environmental conditions. It is also an opportunist human pathogen, exhibiting high intrinsic resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics. To access iron, P. aeruginosa produces two siderophores, pyoverdine and pyochelin, but is also able to use siderophores from other microorganisms in a piracy strategy 21 . The genome of P. aeruginosa encodes 35 TBDTs and at least 20 are dedicated to iron import, three for zinc, one for copper, and one for vitamin B12 21 , 22 . The transcription and expression of the genes encoding TBDTs involved in iron acquisition are all regulated by the bacterial intracellular iron concentration. When iron in the cytoplasm of P. aeruginosa cells reaches a threshold concentration, iron binds to the transcriptional regulator Fur and the complex formed represses the transcription of all genes encoding proteins involved in iron homeostasis, including those for TBDTs 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 . Transcription of some genes encoding TBDTs are also positively regulated, involving sigma ECF/anti-sigma ECF factors, two-component systems, or AraC-like transcriptional regulators 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 . These three different systems can detect the ability of P. aeruginosa to scavenge and import specific ferric-siderophore complexes present in its environment and activate transcription of the gene encoding the TBDT able to import the ferri-siderophore detected. This results in an increase in the expression of the TBDT of the ferri-siderophore complex present in the bacterial environment to increase the efficiency of its uptake 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 . This often goes hand in hand with repression of the transcription of fptA , the gene encoding the TBDT of ferric-pyochelin (one of the two siderophores produced by P. aeruginosa ). Until now, the regulation of transcription and expression of genes encoding TBDTs has been investigated only in the presence of its ligand at one or a few concentrations and at a given time of culture, i.e., stopping the culture and analyzing the levels of transcription or expression using techniques such as RT-qPCR or proteomics 30 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 . How the transcription of such genes changes and varies during bacterial growth and in the presence of different concentrations of siderophores is not precisely known. Here, we aimed to monitor and model the changes in transcription and expression of TBDTs involved in the acquisition of iron across concentration gradients of siderophores. Accordingly, we investigated the transcription of two genes encoding TBDTs, pfeA and foxA , throughout the duration of bacterial culture and in the presence of a wide range of concentrations of siderophores. PfeA imports iron via the tricatechol-type siderophore enterobactin (ENT, Fig. S1 A), a molecule produced by Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium 15 , 33 . Through its three catecholate functions connected to a triserine macrocycle, ENT is the siderophore with the highest known affinity for ferric iron (Ka = 10 49 M −1 ) 38 . FoxA transports iron complexed to hydroxamate siderophores such as nocardamine (NOCA, Fig. S1 B, produced by Streptomyces wadayamensis or Streptomyces parvulus ), a cyclic trihydroxamate molecule also known as desferrioxamine E 16 , 35 . The affinity for ferric iron of this siderophore is weaker than that of ENT (Ka = 10 32 M −1 ) 39 . The X-ray structures of these two TBDTs are known and data are available concerning how ferri-ENT and ferri-NOCA interact with their respective binding sites on PfeA and FoxA 15 , 16 . We followed the expression of these two TBDTs using promoter fusions: the promoter region of one of these two genes was fused to the coding sequence of the fluorescent protein mCherry, used as reporter 40 , and inserted into the genome of P. aeruginosa to have a fluorescent reporter strain for each TBDT. We show these fluorescent reporter strains to be promising tools that make it possible to follow the real-time transcription and expression of pfeA and foxA by fluorescence throughout bacterial growth and in the presence of a wide range of siderophore concentrations. Surprisingly, we did not observe maximum transcription and expression at the same concentrations of siderophores for the two genes. Mathematical modeling was used to precisely characterize the expression levels of these two genes as a function of time and siderophore concentration. Results Construction of the fluorescent reporter strains prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry to follow and investigate PfeA and FoxA expression We chose to use the TBDTs PfeA and FoxA, involved in iron acquisition by ENT and NOCA, respectively 15 , 16 , to create a mathematical model of TBDT expression by P. aeruginosa . To follow the expression of the pfeA and foxA genes, we used promoter fusions in which the promoter sequences of the pfeA or foxA gene were fused to the coding sequence of a reporter that can be easily detected or quantified 40 . In the promoter fusions, the transcription of the reporter gene is controlled by the promoter sequences of the gene of interest, which in turn controls the quantity of mRNA transcribed and, subsequently, that of the protein synthesized. Here, we used the red fluorescent protein mCherry because of its well-documented stability and efficiency as a reporter 41 , 42 , 43 . The promoter regions of pfeA and foxA both contain a Fur box, involved in transcriptional regulation via the regulator Fur and the bacterial intracellular iron concentration (Fig. 1 ). pfeA transcription is also positively regulated by a two-component system involving the inner membrane sensor PfeS and the transcriptional regulator PfeR 27 , 44 , 45 . Consequently, the pfeA promoter region also contains a sequence that interacts with PfeR (Fig. 1 A). Dean et al. identified the various sequences recognized by PfeR in the promoter sequence of pfeA , and called them A1, A2, B1, and B2 (Fig. 1 A) 44 . These binding sites consist of pairs of palindromic sequences located upstream of and near the starting codon of pfeA . Even if deletion of pfeR abolishes pfeA transcription and expression 27 , 31 , the regulation of pfeA transcription is certainly more complex since pfeA seems also to be regulated by two other transcriptional regulators, PirR and CzcR, both also involved in two-component systems (PirS/PirR and CzcS/CzcR) 46 . The precise mechanisms and interconnection between these three transcriptional regulators involved is not clearly elucidate so far. foxA transcription is positively regulated by a sigma factor (FoxI) and its anti-sigma factor (FoxR) 30 , and the promoter region of foxA contains the sequences I1 and I2, predicted to be recognized by FoxI (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, one copy of each palindromic sequence A and B found in the promotor region of pfeA is also found in the promotor region of foxA . The role they play in the regulation of foxA transcription is unknown. Figure 1 Promoter sequences selected for transcriptional fusion. DNA sequences upstream of the ATG codon of pfeA ( A ) and foxA ( B ). The Fur box for both genes is highlighted, as are the binding sites of PfeR (A1, A2; B1, B2) for pfeA and the predicted binding sites of FoxI (I1, I2) for foxA . For pfeA , A1: [86–93]; B1: [115–121]; A2: [145–152]; Fur box: [195–211]; B2: [241–247]. For foxA , B1: [47–53]; A1: [121–128]; I1: [165–170]; Fur box: [165–182]; I2: [186–191]. The two 255-bp sequences presented here were used as promoter regions to construct the fluorescent reporter strains prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry. Full size image For both genes, we selected a 255-bp sequence directly upstream of the the ATG codon. These two regions, followed by the DNA sequence of mCherry, were inserted into the genome of P. aeruginosa between the glm S and PA5548 genes and the strains generated are called prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry, respectively (Table S1 ). This site on the chromosome, well conserved between P. aeruginosa isolates, has already been used to insert the 4500 bp of the pUC18T mini-Tn7T-Gm vector, derived from the Tn7 transposon 47 . We found that insertion of our sequence in the genome of P. aeruginosa did not significantly modify transcription of the glm S or PA5548 genes located next to the insertion locus by RT-qPCR: similar levels of transcription of these two genes were observed in the prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry strains grown in the presence of either ENT or NOCA as in wild type PAO1 (Fig. S2 ). We also checked that the addition of a second promoter in the genome did not interfere with the transcription of pfeA and foxA, again by RT-qPCR. Indeed, we observed similar levels of pfeA and foxA transcription in PAO1 as in the prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry strains grown in the presence of either ENT or NOCA (Fig. S3 ). Regulation of mCherry transcription by the promoter regions of pfeA and foxA We used a RT-qPCR approach to verify that there is, indeed, a correlation between the level of transcription of the mCherry gene and that of pfeA or foxA in the prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry strains, respectively. Such a correlation is essential to use mCherry fluorescence to follow pfeA and foxA expression in prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry. The two strains were grown under iron-restricted conditions (CAA medium) in the presence of increasing concentrations of ENT or NOCA, and the transcription of the mCherry , foxA , and pfeA genes monitored by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2 ). The mRNA levels of both pfeA and mCherry increased in the prom pfeA -mCherry strain as a function of the ENT concentration with a similar sigmoid shape. Transcription started at approximately 0.1 µM ENT and the maximal level of mRNA synthesis was reached at 3 µM for both genes. As the two data sets showed a sigmoid shape, the data were fitted using the Hill Eq. ( 1 ) 48 , 49 , 50 $$H\left(x\right)= {y}_{0}+\left({y}_{max}- {y}_{0}\right)\cdot \frac{{x}^{n}}{{K}^{n}+{x}^{n}},$$ (1) with \(H(x)\) as the genetic expression, \(x\) the concentration of the siderophore, \({y}_{0}\) the basal genetic expression, \({y}_{max}\) the maximal genetic expression, \(K\) the effective affinity, defined as the siderophore concentration needed for the genetic expression to be half of the maximal expression, and \(n\) the Hill coefficient, which determines the steepness at the transition between the inactive and active state around \(x=K\) . We applied the non-linear least-square minimization algorithm to fit the Eq. ( 1 ) with the experimental measurements and found the following values for the model parameters: \({y}_{0}\) = 2.06, \({y}_{max}\) = 28.47, \(n\) = 1.09, \(K\) = 0.29 µM for pfeA and \({y}_{0}\) = 1.33, \({y}_{max}\) = 10.37, \(n\) = 1.55, and \(K\) = 0.40 µM for mCherry . However, the transcription levels of the transporter gene pfeA were higher than those of mCherry for all ENT concentrations tested. Figure 2 Correlation between mCherry and pfeA or foxA transcription in prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of ENT and NOCA, respectively. The P. aeruginosa prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry strains were grown for 8 h in CAA medium in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of ENT (0.001 to 10 µM) or NOCA (1 to 100 µM). The transcription of pfeA (light blue points) and mCherry (dark blue triangles) was followed by RT-qPCR in prom pfeA -mCherry and foxA (red squares) and mCherry (dark red diamonds) in prom foxA -mCherry. The results are expressed as the ratio of the values obtained for the growth in the presence of the siderophores to those obtained in their absence. Each concentration of ENT or NOCA was tested using biological triplicates. The error bars represent the standard errors calculated by CFX Maestro™ Software (Bio-Rad). The reference genes used were clpX and rpoD . The data for prom pfeA -mCherry were fitted using the Hill Eq. ( 1 ), as the two data sets showed a sigmoid shape. The two data sets for prom foxA -mCherry showed a linear shape in the logarithmic domain and, thus, a logarithmic Eq. ( 2 ) was used for each fit. Full size image For the prom foxA -mCherry strain, the transcription levels of foxA and mCherry followed the increasing gradient of NOCA concentrations in a similar logarithmic manner, but not as a sigmoid curve as for pfeA in the prom pfeA -mCherry strain. The maximum transcription for both genes was apparently not reached at 100 µM NOCA (Fig. 2 ). A piecewise linear equation in the logarithmic domain ( 2 ) was used to model this behavior as follows: $$L\left(x\right)=\left\{\begin{array}{l}0, x<{x}_{E}\\ a\cdot {\text{log}}_{10}(\frac{x}{{x}_{E}}), x\ge {x}_{E}\end{array}\right..$$ (2) With \(L(x)\) as the genetic expression, \(x\) the concentration of the siderophore, \(a\) the slope of this logarithmic model, and \({x}_{E}\) the threshold above which the logarithmic behavior starts. We used the same fitting algorithm and found \(a\) = 15.58, \({x}_{E}=0.42\) µM for foxA and \(a\) = 13.58, \({x}_{E}\) = 0.56 µM for mCherry . The level of transcription of the transporter gene foxA was also higher than that of mCherry . Both the pfeA and mCherry RT-qPCR fold-change data sets followed a sigmoid-shaped curve, but their Hill equation parameters showed differences. The parameters \({y}_{0}\) , \(n\) , and \(K\) from the two equations were relatively close to each other, but \({y}_{max}\) was much higher for pfeA than mCherry . To quantitatively assess the likelihood of the expression of pfeA and mCherry , we first normalized the data and then compared them. The method was the following: we (i) normalized the data ( \(\widehat{{FC}_{pfeA}}\) and \(\widehat{{FC}_{mCh}}\) ) between 0 and 1 and put them together in a single dataset we named pfeA + mCherry , (ii) fit this dataset with a single Hill equation \(\widehat{H}(x)\) , and (iii) compared the estimated root mean square error (RMSE) \(RMS{E}_{pfeA}\) and \(RMS{E}_{mCh}\) between this model, which corresponds to the common trend, and the normalized data of each experimental set taken individually (that for pfeA and mCherry ). $$\widehat{H}\left(x\right)=\frac{{x}^{n}}{{K}^{n}+ {x}^{n}},$$ (3) $$\widehat{{FC}_{pfeA}} =\frac{{FC}_{pfeA} -{y}_{0 pfeA}}{{y}_{\mathrm{max}pfeA} -{y}_{0 pfeA}},$$ (4) $$\widehat{{FC}_{mCh}} = \frac{{FC}_{mCh} -{y}_{0 mCh}}{{y}_{max mCh} -{y}_{0 mCh}}.$$ (5) The normalized and pooled data sets are presented in Fig. 3 A with the fitted Hill curves. We calculated the RMSE between the normalized pfeA and mCherry whole data sets and the pfeA + mCherry Hill equation. We found RMSE values of 0.052 and 0.051 for the comparison of the pfeA data set versus that of pfeA + mCherry and the mCherry data set versus that of pfeA + mCherry , respectively. We also calculated the RMSE solely for the transition phase by reducing the range of the dataset on the \(y\) -axis, first between 10 and 90% of maximal expression and then between 20 and 80% of maximal expression. We found RMSE values of 0.065 and 0.070 for pfeA and mCherry , respectively, for the first range and 0.070 and 0.071, respectively, for the second. Therefore, the error of our pfeA + mCherry model is approximately 7%. To obtain an idea of what such an error represents, we calculated the dispersion, which intrinsically exists in the data, by calculating the RMSE between the data and the Hill dataset-specific model for both genes. All RMSE values were of the same order of magnitude, regardless of the domain. Thus, modeling both datasets using a unique model did not appear to introduce any additional error to that intrinsically present in the dataset, suggesting that the model is valid. In conclusion, pfeA and mCherry behave in the same manner with respect to the siderophore concentration in qRT-PCR. Figure 3 Normalization of pfeA , foxA and mCherry transcription. ( A ) The normalized data sets of RT-qPCR fold changes from the prom pfeA -mCherry strain are represented in blue for pfeA and in red for mCherry (data as dots and the Hill curve as the dashed line). The Hill curve of the pfeA + mCherry data set, with an error of ± 7%, is represented by the purple dashed line and the transparent purple area. ( B ) The normalized data sets of RT-qPCR fold changes from the prom foxA -mCherry strain are represented in blue for foxA and in red for mCherry . The logarithmic normalized data sets of foxA , mCherry , and foxA + mCherry are modeled using the same logarithmic equation, with an error of ± 15% represented as a grey dashed line with a transparent grey area. Full size image We normalized the data from prom foxA -mCherry using the same method and created the pooled data set foxA + mCherry . The logarithmic models of the normalized transcriptional expression data of foxA and mCherry and those of foxA + mCherry all had the same parameters ( \(a\) = 0.5 and \({x}_{E}\) = 1 µM, Fig. 3 B). We calculated the RMSE between the normalized foxA and mCherry data sets and the foxA + mCherry logarithmic equation and found RMSE values of 0.123 and 0.151 for the comparison of the foxA data set versus that of foxA + mCherry and the mCherry data set versus that of foxA + mCherry , respectively. The error of our foxA + mCherry model is aproximately 15%. Using the same approach as for pfeA and mCherry , we computed the intrinsic dispersion between the foxA or mCherry data and the foxA + mCherry model. The RMSE values between the data and the model were also of the same order of magnitude. The use of a single model for both data sets did not introduce any additional error beyond the intrinsic variability present in the data. Hence, the validity of the model remains unaffected. In conclusion, foxA and mCherry exhibit similar behavior as a function of the siderophore concentration in qRT-PCR. Overall, the prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry constructs meet all the criteria of a fusion reporter. For both constructs the transcription of mCherry follows that of the studied TBDT, demonstrating that mCherry transcription and expression are regulated by the promoter region of both TBDTs. However, it should be noted that we observed a higher level of transcription for the genes encoding the TBDT than that of mCherry for both constructs. This difference was more pronounced in the case of the fusion reporter carrying the pfeA promoter region. Interestingly, the transcription of both the pfeA and foxA genes appears to not respond in the same way nor with the same efficiency to the presence of their siderophores. Maximum transcription was reached for pfeA with 3 µM ENT, whereas the maximum was not reached for foxA with 100 µM NOCA. mCherry expression modelling in both prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry cells The transcription kinetics of mCherry and pfeA in prompfeA-mCherry and those of mCherry and foxA in promfoxA-mCherry follow the same dynamics, allowing the two fusion reporters to be used to monitor the expression of the two TBDTs under different growth conditions. Stimulation of pfeA or foxA transcription and expression lead to an increase in mCherry synthesis and, consequently, in the monitored fluorescence of mCherry. We followed pfeA and foxA expression by monitoring mCherry fluorescence during prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry growth in CAA medium with increasing concentrations of ENT and NOCA. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 nm ) and the fluorescence of mCherry at 610 nm (excitation wavelength: 570 nm) as a function of time (Fig. 4 A,B). There was no significant increase in fluorescence for either construct at any tested concentration of ENT or NOCA for the first 6 h of culture. For prom pfeA -mCherry, we observed an increase in mCherry fluorescence during bacterial growth for concentrations of ENT of 0.1 µM or higher, with maximum fluorescence obtained from 3 µM of ENT and higher (Fig. 4 A). For prom foxA -mCherry, the monitored fluorescence of mCherry increased with increasing concentrations of NOCA and no saturation was observed (Fig. 4 B). Figure 4 mCherry fluorescence monitored in both prom pfeA -mCherry ( A ) and prom foxA -mCherry ( B ) strains. prom pfeA –mCherry and prom foxA –mCherry strains were grown in CAA medium in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of ENT and NOCA (0.01µM to 100 µM), respectively, and the OD 600 nm and fluorescence of mCherry (excitation at 570 nm and emission at 610 nm) monitored. The bacterial fluorescence rate calculated using Eq. ( 6 ) is represented for each concentration. Three independent experiments with three technical replicates were performed for each concentration of ENT and NOCA tested (n = 3). Only the means of the three data points are shown and no error bars are shown for convenience. Full size image For each condition, the fluorescence data were treated as follows: the fluorescence data of the control (without siderophore) was first subtracted from the fluorescence of the condition of interest. Then, for each condition, the resulting fluorescence was divided by the OD 600 nm ( \({Absorbance}_{condition}\) ), which represents the density of the bacteria in the sample (6). Within a factor of one, the result can be considered to be the fluorescence signal emitted by a single bacterium. $$({Fluorescence}_{condition}-{Fluorescence}_{control})/{Absorbance}_{condition},$$ (6) Rate of mCherry synthesis To characterize all the curves of the fluorescence data shown in Fig. 4 , we used the synthesis Eq. ( 7 ) for each condition. We modeled the transient evolution of the fluorescence signal using two assumptions: (i) the fluorescence signal is directly proportional to the concentration of mCherry: \(F=k\cdot P\) , where \(F\) is the fluorescence signal and \(P\) the concentration of mCherry, and (ii) the temporal evolution of the concentration of mCherry can be modeled by a first-order differential Eq. ( 7 ) involving the gene expression \(\beta\) (in µM/h) and the degradation rate of mCherry \(d\) (in h −1 ). $$\frac{dP}{dt}=\beta -d\cdot P.$$ (7) The solution of this differential equation is given in ( 8 ) $$P\left(t\right)= {P}_{\infty }\cdot \left(1- {e}^{\left(- \frac{t- {t}_{0}}{\tau }\right)}\right),$$ (8) where \({P}_{\infty }\) is the concentration of mCherry at the steady state (concentration reached after an infinite time), \({t}_{0}\) represents the lag time or adaptation time (time between the start of culture and the beginning of mCherry synthesis, which also depends on the fluorescence detection threshold of the analytic instrument), and \(\tau\) is the characteristic time, which is equal to \(2.2/d\) , and corresponds to the time required to reach 63% of \({P}_{\infty }\) . According to Eq. ( 8 ), at steady state, we can state that $$\beta = \frac{{P}_{\infty }}{\tau }.$$ (9) Thus, within a factor of one, the gene activity can be deduced from the fluorescence curve after having fitted this fluorescence using Eq. ( 8 ). For certain conditions, in particular, conditions in which the fluorescence curve is close to zero, the fit of the synthesis Eq. ( 8 ) by the first-order model fails, leading to aberrant parameters (very-high \({P}_{\infty }\) and/or small \(\tau\) ). The data of these conditions were removed for further analysis. The \(\beta\) values of accepted conditions plotted for the strains prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry are shown in Fig. 5 . The rate of mCherry synthesis followed the gradient of ENT with a sigmoid shape for the prom pfeA -mCherry strain and in a logarithmic manner for the gradient of NOCA in the prom foxA –mCherry strain. Figure 5 Fold change in mCherry synthesis in prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry cells grown in iron-restricted conditions and in the presence of increasing concentrations of ENT and NOCA, respectively. The \(\beta\) values of strain prom pfeA -mCherry (filled blue circles, empty blue circles are outliers) are plotted according to the ENT concentration and those of strain prom foxA -mCherry (filled red circles, the empty red circles are outliers) according to the NOCA concentration. The sigmoid curve fitted with the Hill Eq. ( 1 ) on the prom pfeA -mCherry data is represented by the blue dashed line and the parameters obtained were: \({y}_{0}\) = 73.08, \({y}_{max}\) = 874.07, \(n\) = 2.10, \(K\) = 0.61 µM. The logarithmic model (2) based on prom foxA -mCherry data is represented by the red dashed line and the parameters obtained were: \(a\) = 192.93 and \({x}_{E}\) = 0.45 µM. Outliers were not considered for either curve fitting. Full size image We treated the fluorescence data for prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry as previously described to compare them to the RT-qPCR data. Again, we calculated the RMSE between the common model and the gene-specific model as a metric to assess the validity of this approach. $$\widehat{{FC}_{RT-qPCR}} = \frac{{FC}_{RT-qPCR} -{y}_{0 RT-qPCR}}{{y}_{max RT-qPCR} -{y}_{0 RT-qPCR}},$$ (10) $$\widehat{{FC}_{Fluo}} =\frac{{FC}_{Fluo} -{y}_{0 Fluo}}{{y}_{\mathrm{max}Fluo} -{y}_{0 Fluo}}.$$ (11) The normalized and pooled data sets with the fitted models for prom pfeA -mCherry are represented in Fig. 6 A. We performed a similar analysis as presented before and calculated the RMSE between the normalized RT-qPCR and Fluo whole data sets and the RT-qPCR + Fluo Hill equation. We found RMSE values of 0.068 and 0.107 for the comparison RT-qPCR / RT-qPCR + Fluo and Fluo / RT-qPCR + Fluo , respectively. We also calculated the RMSE for the transition phase, which involved first using only data between 0.1 and 0.9 and then 0.2 and 0.8 of the normalized fold change. The RMSE values were 0.083 and 0.099 for the data between 0.1 and 0.9 and 0.100 and 0.103 for the data between 0.2 and 0.8 for RT-qPCR and Fluo respectively. Thus, the error of our RT-qPCR + Fluo model is approximately 10%. Figure 6 Normalization of the models from RT-qPCR data and fluorescence analysis. ( A ) The normalized set of RT-qPCR fold changes from prom pfeA -mCherry for mCherry are represented in red and the normalized set of \(beta\) values from the fluorescence data in green (data as filled circles, outliers as empty circles, and the Hill curve as a dashed line). The Hill curve of RT-qPCR + Fluo, with an error of ± 10%, is represented as an orange dashed line with a transparent orange area. The table shows the Hill parameters of the different normalized data sets. ( B ) The normalized set of RT-qPCR fold changes from prom foxA -mCherry for mCherry is represented in red and the normalized set of \(beta\) values from the fluorescence data in green. The normalized logarithmic model fitted for the three data sets is represented as a grey dashed line, with an error of ± 15% indicated by the transparent grey area. Full size image Applying a similar methodology as that used for the RT-qPCR data previously, we determined the inherent dispersion between the RT-qPCR or Fluo data and the RT-qPCR + Fluo model. The RMSE between the data and the model showed a comparable magnitude. The utilization of a single model for both datasets did not introduce any additional errors beyond the inherent variability in the data. Therefore, the validity of the model remains unaltered. Thus, the RT-qPCR and Fluo data, in other words, the transcriptional expression of mCherry and mCherry synthesis, appear to show analogous behavior in relation to the siderophore concentration. As previously, for prom foxA -mCherry, both the transcriptional expression of mCherry and mCherry synthesis could be normalized and modeled by the logarithmic equation of RT-qPCR + Flu . The normalized models of the transcriptional expression of mCherry and mCherry synthesis and RT-qPCR + Fluo all had the same parameters ( \(a\) = 0.5 and \({x}_{E}\) = 1 µM, Fig. 6 B). For the comparison of RT-qPCR / RT-qPCR + Fluo , the RMSE value was the same as that previously calculated, 0.151. We calculated the RMSE for the comparison of Fluo / RT-qPCR + Fluo and found a value of 0.087. Here, we also assessed the intrinsic dispersion between the RT-qPCR or Fluo data and the RT-qPCR + Fluo model. The RMSE between the data and the model were of similar magnitude. Employing a single model for both datasets did not introduce additional errors beyond the inherent variability. Thus, the model’s validity remains unchanged, indicating analogous behavior between the RT-qPCR and Fluo data in response to the siderophore concentration. Discussion The use of mathematical equations allows the quantification and prediction of biological processes, which can provide insights that may not be immediately apparent from experimental data alone. For example, mathematical modeling can be used to make predictions about the relationships between different variables, such as the relationship between mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, mathematical models can also help to identify potential sources of error or uncertainty in the data and can be used to simulate different scenarios and test the robustness of a model. However, mathematical modeling usually requires large datasets. Here, we developed two biological constructs that are very helpful for the rapid and low-cost generation of datasets to monitor the expression of the two TBDTs FepA and FoxA in P. aeruginosa cells to predict the future expression of different TBDTs present in the genome of P. aeruginosa , depending on the bacterial environment. First, the constructed fluorescent reporters were created by fusing the promoter region of the genes encoding the TBDTs PfeA and FoxA (Fig. 1 ) with the coding sequence of the fluorescent protein mCherry, used as reporter, to generate sufficient data for the mathematical modelling. These fusions were inserted into the genome of P. aeruginosa between the glm S and PA5548 genes, a region previously used for gene insertion 47 . With our prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry constructs, an increase in fluorescent is expected when the expression of the gene encoding the TBDT is activated. Such constructs allow the screening of multiple conditions in 96-well microplates. RT-qPCR or proteomic approaches could have been used to follow the expression of genes encoding TBDTs 34 , 35 , 36 , 51 , but such approaches are much more costly and time consuming and it is impossible to rapidly generate a large amount of data. We conducted various tests to verify that the prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry constructs are reliable and that the mCherry fluorescence values are representative of the expression of the TBDT of interest. First, we used RT-qPCR to show that insertion of our sequence (TBDT promotor region with mCherry ) in the genome of P. aeruginosa does not significantly modify the transcription of the glm S and PA5548 genes and that the presence of two promoters in the genome (in front of the genes encoding the TBDT and mCherry) of P. aeruginosa does not interfere with the transcription of pfeA or foxA . We also verified that transcription of the gene encoding mCherry follows that of the gene encoding the studied TBDT for both constructs, demonstrating that mCherry transcription and expression are regulated by the promoter region of the TBDT of interest. RT-qPCR data showed parallel mRNA synthesis kinetics for the genes encoding mCherry and the TBDT of interest. However, we observed a higher level of transcription for the genes encoding PfeA or FoxA than mCherry , which was more pronounced for the fusion reporter carrying the pfeA promoter region. One possible reason is that the stability of the mRNA of pfeA or foxA and mCherry may differ, with the mRNA of pfeA or foxA being more stable, resulting in higher mRNA levels than for mCherry . Overall, the controls we carried out show that the fluorescence of mCherry measured using our fluorescent reporters prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry is representative of the expression of the transporters PfeA and FoxA, respectively. The use of these fluorescent reporters was highly successful and allowed us to generate a large amount of data to study the effect of increasing concentrations of siderophores. Modelling the data generated using our two fluorescent reporters showed that the expression of the pfeA and foxA genes in the two strains, prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry, does not respond in the same way or with the same efficiency to the presence of increasing concentrations of their corresponding siderophores. The transcription of pfeA showed a sigmoidal shape, whereas the transcription of foxA was logarithmic. Maximum transcription for pfeA was reached for 3 µM ENT and higher, whereas the maximum was not reached for foxA with 100 µM NOCA (Fig. 6 ). The Hill coefficient of the model suggests that the regulatory mechanism between pfeA and ENT is cooperative but that the transition between the expressed and inhibited states is smooth. The transition occurs just before 1 µM. Thus, the concentration of 10 µM ENT, which we generally used to activate pfeA transcription in previous publications 34 , is sensible and the behavior of the bacteria should not change much if the ENT concentration increases above 10 µM and should be stable for small variations of concentration around 10 µM. On the other hand, the activation of foxA expression by NOCA was much weaker and we cannot consider that maximal expression is reached at 100 µM, which is our technical limit. At lower concentrations of NOCA, the changes in fluorescence were probably too small to be detected and at higher concentrations, NOCA started to precipitate. The logarithmic fitting used in this paper is only valid for the available range, but we have no idea of how the production rate evolves beyond 100 µM. Another consequence is that, in contrast to pfeA , the expression of foxA is not stable for concentrations around 10 µM and might change significantly, even for small variations of concentration around this value. There are several possible explanations for the difference in the expression of pfeA and foxA as a function of the concentrations of their corresponding siderophores, the first being the different transcriptional regulatory systems involved. pfeA transcription is also regulated by two-component systems 27 , 45 , 46 , whereas sigma and anti-sigma factors are involved for foxA 30 , 35 . In the case of PfeA, the ENT-Fe complex has to bind to the PfeA binding site to be transported into the periplasm and interact in this cell compartment with the inner membrane sensor PfeS of the transcriptional regulatory system 27 . This PfeS-ENT-Fe interaction then liberates the transcriptional regulator PfeR to activate transcription of the pfeA gene. Nothing is known about the affinity of PfeS for ENT-Fe or the mechanism of interaction. Likely, on this transcriptional regulation of pfeA by the PfeS/PfeR couple, another regulation is probably integrated involving two other two-component systems, PirS/PirR and CzcS/CzcR 46 . The first is implicated in the transcriptional regulation of pirA , a TBDT involved in the import of iron, either by ENT or monocathechol-type siderophores 32 , 37 , 52 . The second system, CzcS/CzcR, is involved in Zinc homeostasis, heavy metal and antibiotic resistance and swimming motility 53 , 54 , 55 . In the case of foxA transcription, the NOCA-Fe complex has to interact with the FoxA binding site at the cell surface to obtain an interaction between the signaling domain of the TBDT and its anti-sigma factor FoxI 56 . This protein interaction leads to dissociation of the transcriptional regulator FoxR from FoxI, which can then interact with the promoter region of foxA to drive the transcription of this gene. In this mechanism, the binding of NOCA-Fe to the PfeA binding site is a key step to induce the system. The regulation mechanisms of the transcription of pfeA or foxA are very different and of different complexity are may not function with the same efficiency. They involve different protein–protein and siderophore-protein interactions and in the case of ENT-Fe, its uptake into the periplasm. There are other factors upstream and downstream of these two regulatory cascades that can affect the efficiency of pfeA and foxA gene transcription. These include the affinity of the two siderophores for ferric iron, with ENT having a higher affinity than NOCA at neutral pH: Ka = 10 49 M −1 for ENT and Ka = 10 32 M −1 for NOCA 38 , 39 . Consequently, ENT will be more efficient for the competition for iron with pyoverdine and pyochelin (the two siderophores produced by P. aeruginosa ) than NOCA. In addition, when the siderophore-Fe complexes are formed, NOCA-Fe binds to its binding site on FoxA, located on the plug domain of the FoxA structure, with a Kd of 178 nM before being imported through the outer membrane 16 , 35 . Unlike the NOCA-Fe/FoxA pair, ENT-Fe can interact with two binding sites on PfeA, one located in the extracellular loops and the second on the plug domain of PfeA 15 . Affinity measurements showed that one of these sites is a high affinity site and the other a lower affinity site (Kd = 60 nm and Kd = 155 µM for the two binding sites on PfeA) 15 . Currently it is impossible to know which of the two sites identified by crystallography is the low or high affinity site. The differences between the binding of FoxA and PfeA to their siderophore-Fe complexes may affect the regulation of the transcription of the foxA and pfeA genes differently, as this binding step is essential in the regulatory process in both cases. Furthermore, in the cytoplasm, the promoter regions of the pfeA and foxA genes are different and the mechanisms of recognition of PfeR and FoxI are different and may also affect the efficiency of transcription. The systems and mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in the two iron import pathways are different and highly complex, involving different protein–protein interactions and different interactions between proteins and the siderophore-Fe complexes. The mathematical model described in this paper is more a phenomenological model than a precise description of the biochemical mechanisms involved. The building of such a model would obviously be an asset in understanding regulatory phenomena but would require the parallel measurement of various concentrations of several molecules, which is not straightforward from an experimental point of view. Model refinement techniques could make it possible to generate hypotheses, but these can be very difficult to validate experimentally. Due to such complexity, it is currently impossible to identify which factor(s) is/are responsible for the large differences in the expression kinetics of the foxA and pfeA genes as a function of the concentration of their respective siderophores. As a next step, it would be informative to test other siderophores (analogues of ENT and NOCA) that can be recognized by these two TBDTs to determine whether they affect the expression of these two genes in the same way. It would also be informative to test mixtures of different concentrations of ENT and NOCA and see the effect on the expression of these two genes in a situation in which both siderophores are in competition for iron. The tools that we have developed here can also help improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in the expression of TBDTs. One can imagine, for example, testing deletions of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, such as PfeS/PfeR or FoxI/FoxR, or amino acid mutations of the binding sites of PfeA or FoxA and assessing the effect on our model. In conclusion, the promoter fusions prom pfeA -mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry are powerful tools to follow the expression of a TBDT in P. aeruginosa . Mathematical modelling of the data obtained showed that the expression of pfeA displays a sigmoidal shape, whereas it is logarithmic for foxA , with maximum transcription for pfeA at 3 µM ENT, whereas the maximum was not reached with 100 µM NOCA for foxA . These results have important implications for the understanding of how P. aeruginosa adapts the expression of its TBDTs to changing environmental conditions and highlight the value of using mathematical models as a tool to investigate iron homeostasis and, more generally, bacterial physiology. Our results provide a foundation for the development of a larger system for studying the regulation of all iron acquisition pathways of P. aeruginosa . Materials and methods Chemicals Enterobactin (ENT) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Nocardamine (NOCA) was purified as previously described 57 . Bacterial strains and growth conditions P. aeruginosa strains used in this study are listed in Table S1 in Supplemental Materials. Bacteria were first grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) at 30 °C overnight. Afterwards, they were pellet, washed and resuspended in iron-deficient CAA (casamino acid) medium (composition: 5 g L −1 low-iron CAA (Difco), 1.46 g L −1 K 2 HPO 4 3H 2 O, 0.25 g L −1 MgSO 4 7H 2 O) and grown over night at 30 °C. In order to monitor growth in the presence of siderophores, cells were resuspended again in fresh CAA medium at an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 nm ) of 0.01, grown in 96 well plates, in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of ENT (0.001–100 µM) or NOCA (0.01–100 µM). Plates were incubated at 30 °C, with shaking every 15 min, in a microplate reader (Infinite® 200 PRO M Nano+, Tecan). Growth was followed by measuring the OD 600 nm and the fluorescence of mCherry (excitation at 570 nm and emission at 610 nm) every 30 min, for 24 h. Construction of the prompfeA–mCherry and promfoxA–mCherry strains Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) was used as the host strain for the plasmids. The DNA fragments from P. aeruginosa used for cloning were amplified from the genomic DNA of strain PAO1 with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). The insertion of the sequence was done in the intergenic region between glmS and PA5548 using a pEXG2 plasmid 58 . The construction of the plasmids was realized with the NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix. The primers are listed in Table S2 in Supplemental Materials. As previously described, recombinant clones were isolated and then verified by PCR and Sanger sequencing 37 . Quantitative real-time PCR analyses Specific gene transcription was measured by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Overnight cultures of bacterial cells grown in CAA medium were pelleted, resuspended and diluted in fresh medium to obtain an OD 600 nm of 0.1. The cells were then grown with or without siderophores, under shaking, at 30 °C for 8 h. Afterward, 2.5 × 10 8 cells were mixed with two volumes of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen). Samples were lysed in Tris–EDTA at pH 8.0 containing 15 mg mL −1 lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at 25 °C. Afterwards, total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy MinElute Spin Columns and gDNA Eliminator Spin Columns from RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Quiagen). A treatment by DNase (RNase-Free DNase Set, Qiagen) was realized for each sample Reverse transcription of RNA was done using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) with 1 µg of input RNA. Gene expression was measured with a CFX Opus 96 Real-Time PCR Instrument (Bio-Rad) using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and the appropriate primers (listed in Supporting Information Table S2 ). Five genes ( rpoD , clpX , rpsL , proC and uvrD ) were tested as reference genes using the Reference Gene Selector Tool based on GeNorm in CFX Maestro™ Software (Bio-Rad). PAO1, prom pfeA- mCherry and prom foxA -mCherry strains were grown for 8 h in the absence and presence of siderophores (10 µM ENT for PAO1 and prom pfeA- mCherry, 100 µM of NOCA for PAO1 and prom foxA -mCherry). We have chosen to use clpX and rpoD in our assays because their stability across the different conditions were the highest (Fig. S4 ). For the data analysis, the quantification cycles were determined by regression and the fold-change calculated with the Pfaffl Method. Data processing and mathematical modeling All the data processing and the mathematical modeling was done with Python 3.8 ( https://www.python.org/ ) and packages ( https://pypi.org/ ): Pandas was used to manipulate and manage the data; NumPy and SciPy were used to process the data and create the models; Matplotlib was used for visualizations. The equation parameters were found by using the curvefit function from scipy.optimize on our experimental data.
