Introduction In the world, over 1/3 of the population has had chronic hepatitis B infection or is currently infected, and about 12% of these people are HBsAg positive 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 .When effective treatment is not available or when patients refuse to receive it, 2% to 4% of patients develop liver fibrosis or even compensatory cirrhosis every year, and with the progression of the disease, patients with cirrhosis will gradually develop decompensated cirrhosis 6 , 7 , 8 .As a result of the severe complications of liver cirrhosis (portal hypertension, spontaneous peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, etc.), most patients are repeatedly hospitalized, and their daily lives are also adversely affected, and some severe patients even die from their liver cirrhosis 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 .There is no doubt that this is a great challenge for China's medical cause. In China, the incidence rate and prevalence of hepatitis B have decreased over the past few years since the vaccine policy was implemented, but this has not significantly reduced the incidence of end-stage liver disease or liver cancer caused by chronic hepatitis B in a short period of time 1 , 13 .Therefore, there is still a need to solve public health problems such as cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and even liver cancer caused by hepatitis B. The liver biopsy is generally considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, however, it is an invasive procedure that can cause pain, cannot be repeated, and has certain risks, which are often unacceptable to patients 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 23 , 24 .Furthermore, the quality of liver biopsy samples is generally restricted by factors such as sample size, sampling error, histological error, and inconspicuous histological findings at the early stages of fibrosis.Therefore, liver biopsy is not routinely used to detect liver fibrosis/cirrhosis 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 . Thus, several noninvasive methods have been developed to evaluate liver fibrosis/cirrhosis due to the limitations of liver biopsy.In general, these methods are divided into biological ones based on the identification of serological markers and physical ones based on radiographic assessments of liver elasticity 27 .As serum markers' diagnostic accuracy is influenced by many factors, the diagnostic rate for early fibrosis is low, and there is literature showing that the variability of the natural evolution of HBV, immune activity, and inflammation will affect the accuracy of serum markers in diagnosing HBV fibrosis and cirrhosis. As a result, many patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis are missed 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 .As a result of their limitations, serum markers that indicate liver fibrosis/cirrhosis are not used widely for hepatitis B liver fibrosis/cirrhosis 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 . An elastic image reflects the mechanical properties of tissues and their hardness, and fibrosis levels are positively correlated with hardness 35 .Elastography imaging methods most commonly used are vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE), 2D shear wave elastography (2D SWE), point shear wave elastography (pSWE) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) 36 , 37 .American Association of Gastroenterology (ACG), European Association for Liver Research (EASL), and European Federation of Medical and Biological Ultrasound Societies (EUROSON) have recently recommended VCTE for the evaluation of chronic liver disease (CLD) and fibrosis associated with chronic viral hepatitis 38 , 39 .According to EUROSON, VCTE (also known as FibroScan, Echosens) greater than 7.6 kPa indicates significant fibrosis (F2), while 11.0–13.6 kPa indicates cirrhosis (F4).The literature suggests that although VCTE cannot replace liver biopsy, it can be used as a substitute for patients who refuse liver biopsy and as a method of evaluating CLD over a long period of time 38 , 39 , 40 . There was a time when people believed liver fibrosis was irreversible, especially when the disease progressed to the stage of cirrhosis.In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated that liver fibrosis is a reversible pathophysiological condition 39 , 40 .Currently, antiviral treatment is the main treatment for hepatitis B liver fibrosis.The treatment can slightly reverse liver fibrosis, but it is limited by drug resistance and poor virological responses in some patients.Despite long-term antiviral treatment, some patients may develop liver fibrosis 41 .There has been extensive research showing that traditional Chinese medicine can effectively treat liver fibrosis and improve liver function in recent years 42 .Biejia Decoction pill, a traditional Chinese medicine compound, significantly improved liver fibrosis in vivo and in vitro.A Biejia Decoction pill was used to inhibit the proliferation and decrease collagen content of activated HSC-LX-2 cells, while inhibiting collagen deposition in these cells, as reported by the researchers.The researchers also found that Biejia Decoction pill down-regulated TGF-β 1 and Smad3 expression and changed the percentage of G0/G1 and S phase cells, suggesting that Biejia Decoction pill may work by preventing liver injury and reversing liver fibrosis as its primary mechanism 43 , 44 .Additionally, relevant pharmacological studies have demonstrated that Biejia Decoction pill can stimulate the degradation of collagen tissue, as well as dissolve and absorb liver fibrosis, reduce collagen synthesis, decrease excessive deposition, and effectively reverse liver fibrosis 45 , 46 , 47 . This paper attempts to evaluate and identify the changes of liver elasticity value of patients with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis B before and after treatment using VCTE (liver fibrosis scanning), and to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of ETV and Biejia Decoction Pill when treating liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in hepatitis B patients.So as to provide more clinical data for the treatment plan and clinical management of chronic hepatitis B patients with Biejia Decoction Pill's effect on liver fibrosis. Materials and methods Research object Research object and grouping We retrospectively selected 120 patients to receive entecavir and 119 patients to receive both entecavir and Biejia Decoction Pill at the same time (informed and agreed by the patients), which both with hepatitis B liver fibrosis/cirrhosis visited the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University between January 2019 and February 2022 randomly (aged 19–83 years, male to female ratio of about 2:1 ).These patient information and data were obtained from the hospital network database.An observation group was treated with entecavir capsules (Fujian Guangshengtang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd,GYZZ H20110172,0.5 mg/qd) combined with a Biejia Decoction Pill * (Sinopharm Group Zhonglian Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd,GYZZ Z42020772, 3g/tid) .

Discussion A lack of effective and safe therapeutic options for chronic hepatitis B makes it difficult to clear latent virus-like particles from the body, and clinicians mainly use antiviral therapy to control the disease's progression.Even so, in some patients, hepatitis B virus replication is not active, so it would not cause serious acute liver problems.But there's a possibility that hepatitis will eventually turn into liver fibrosis, which worsens liver function, and eventually leads to cirrhosis with end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. According to a longitudinal analysis of untreated hepatitis B patients, they have a cumulative risk of developing cirrhosis of up to 20% within five years. In contrast to patients with cirrhosis caused by other causes, patients with this cause have significantly lower survival rates and prognoses, with a five-year survival rate of only 15% to 40% 1 .There are still some patients with hepatitis B whose disease process cannot be effectively controlled even after receiving active antiviral treatment in time, causing them to develop cirrhosis or even end-stage liver disease, which may be caused by chronic hepatitis B low-level viremia (LLV) during the treatment cycle. LLV refers to a persistent or intermittent HBV DNA load greater than the lower limit of detection, but not exceeding 2000 IU/ml.An analysis of risk factors for fibrosis progression in patients with persistently low levels of hepatitis B virus load during treatment shows that hypoviremia affects all stages of hepatitis B, and these patients have a higher risk of liver fibrosis than those with maintained virological response (MVR) .According to the study, there was a 22 percent rate of liver fibrosis progression during antiviral treatment, a 24 percent rate of uncertain liver fibrosis progression, and a 117 percent rate of liver fibrosis regression among 163 patients with obvious liver fibrosis.COX univariate and multivariate analysis of the risk factors for the progression of liver fibrosis showed that the risk of further aggravation of liver fibrosis in LLV patients increased nearly five times when the course of treatment was 7 to 8 weeks 49 . It has been reported that even after active antiviral treatment, 1/5–3/5 patients still suffer from disease progression after two years, and in severe cases, even liver failure.After antiviral treatment, one third of the patients developed LLV, which may explain their poor prognosis.According to the study, patients without a viral response are more likely to be stimulated by various cytokines to produce a series of immune responses during liver fibrosis, which is one of the major factors contributing to liver cancer progression.Accordingly, LLV patients are more likely than MRV patients to develop liver cancer 50 . In this study, a small number of patients in each subgroup experienced fibrosis aggravation during the treatment stage, but the aggravation degree in the observation group was much lower than it was in the control group, which might be related to the enhancement of anti-virus effects of entecavir by Biejia Decoction Pills.After the treatment with Biejia Decoction Pills, with the prolongation of the course of treatment, when the course of treatment ≥ 9 months, the rate of HBV-DNA turning negative in the observation group reached 87.4%. This number was significantly higher than that of the control group (70.8%), and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.002 < 0.05).The rate of HBV-DNA turning negative in the observation group can reach 95% when the treatment period is ≥ 12 months.Even some of the patients with liver cirrhosis experienced cirrhosis reversal after one year of combined treatment (LSM < 17.5). Several studies have shown that liver fibrosis continues to progress in some patients with MRV, but the specific mechanism remains unclear.This may be related to metabolic syndrome, alcohol consumption, and other factors.There was still improvement of liver fibrosis in some patients with MRV in the observation group of this study, suggesting that Biejia Decoction Pills could reverse liver fibrosis not only by strengthening antiviral treatment with entecavir.Using Biejia Decoction Pills, modern pharmacological research shows that it clears the liver, reduces liver fibrosis, inhibits collagen production, and decreases serum transaminase levels, inhibits the release of inflammatory factors, and reduces liver fibrosis by reducing liver inflammatory activity 51 . Based on a domestic study observing the effect of Biejia Decoction Pills on the improvement of liver inflammation and fibrosis in mice models of liver fibrosis, it was found that Biejia had obvious inhibitory effects on mononuclear macrophages through mouse experiments, which theoretically proved that Biejia was anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic.Based on these results, its mechanism of action may be related to inhibition of monocyte infiltration and reduction of monocyte pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine secretion 52 .The study confirmed the possibility of treating liver fibrosis with monocytes as a target, as well as provided new ideas on how to clarify liver fibrosis at the molecular level in the future. A further subgroup analysis of patients in the liver fibrosis group showed no significant difference in reversing liver fibrosis between the observation group and the control group in the mild fibrosis subgroup (χ2 = 0.441 P = 0.506 > 0.05); only three (6.5%) patients in the observation group experienced fibrosis aggravation compared to 8 (18.2%) patients in the control group.The reversal rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group in the moderate and severe fibrosis subgroups, and the difference was statistically significant (χ2 = 4.82 P = 0.028 < 0.05).Therefore, for patients with early mild liver fibrosis and MRV, only entecavir can be given long-term antiviral treatment, and monitor LSM regularly.The risk of liver fibrosis progression is high in patients with LLV, so we can adjust antiviral drugs for patients with poor or no response to virology and use compound Biejia decoction pills (long-term treatment is recommended) toachieve viral response and reverse liver fibrosis as soon as possible. Nearly 20% of patients with mild liver fibrosis have slight aggravation.In such patients, it is essential to undergo regular VCTE examinations to monitor the progression of liver fibrosis, as well as to monitor HBV-DNA levels in order to understand the virus' replication status.According to the study, more patients with moderate and severe fibrosis and cirrhosis developed fibrosis aggravation after antiviral treatment, highlighting the poor antiviral and fibrosis reversal efficacy of entecavir.Therefore, no matter whether such patients have MRV or not, they should add Compound Biejia Decoction pill in time to control the progress of liver fibrosis, and adjust the course of treatment according to the results of HBV-DNA, VCTE and other tests, so as to delay the progression of liver fibrosis to the greatest extent possible. To sum up, for patients with chronic hepatitis B, on the basis of entecavir capsule treatment, supplemented with Biejia Decoction Pill treatment will help to control the further development of liver fibrosis in patients, and may even reverse liver fibrosis and improve clinical symptoms.In addition, patients had a higher response rate to the HBV DNA virus when the use time of Biejia decoction pills was prolonged, which contributed to the efficacy of the entecavir antiviral treatment.In recent years, some domestic studies have shown that traditional Chinese medicine can reverse chronic liver fibrosis caused by a variety of factors. In addition to being cheap, safe, and easy to access, these drugs provide more hope in controlling liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in the future 53 , 54 . Next, we should conduct a systematic study on the pathology and molecular level of these traditional Chinese medicines that have been proven to have a definite effect on liver fibrosis, to clarify the cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis regression, and to investigate the possible pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in order to develop new drugs. Conclusion Hepatitis B liver fibrosis/cirrhosis patients treated with Biejia Decoction Pills and ETV showed significant improvement in liver fibrosis;The virological response rate of HBV-DNA increased with prolonged treatment, suggesting that Biejia Decoction Pillsmay help entecavir in its antiviral activity.
