Analytical methods have been employed to study various aspects of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) hybrid nanofluid flow. Researchers have favored the homotopy perturbation method (HPM) as an analytical technique to solve a range of heat transport and fluid mechanics differential equations in recent studies 28 , 29 . The AkbariGanji method (AGM), another analytical approach, has been introduced to address certain issues in fluid thermal analysis 30 , 31 . The literature review has shown that the flow of MHD hybrid nanofluids has been extensively studied in various applications, including biomedical, industrial, and heat transfer systems. However, there is still a research gap in understanding the behavior of nanofluids in semi-porous channels under the influence of magnetic fields and heat radiation. The present study, titled "Investigating the Impact of Heat Radiation on Magnetically-Induced Forced Convection of Nanofluid in a Semi-Porous Channel", aims to fill this gap by examining how heat radiation affects magnetically-induced forced convection of CuO-water nanofluid in a semi-porous channel. The study utilizes Akbari-Ganji's and the Homotopy perturbation methods, both advantageous analytical techniques for solving complex thermal problems. The research provides valuable insights into improving heat transfer in semi-porous channels by analyzing the effects of multiple parameters, such as the Hartmann number, Reynolds number, Eckert number, radiation parameter, and suction parameter. This is essential for various industrial and engineering applications. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the development of more efficient thermal management systems in the future. Mathematical framework Governing formulas In this study, we investigate a nanofluid's steady flow and heat transfer characteristics in a semi-porous channel. The geometry of the channel and its boundary conditions are illustrated in Fig. 1 . We consider the impact of a constant vertical magnetic field on the nanofluid's flow and heat transfer characteristics. Additionally, we consider the effects of thermal radiation and Joule heating on the temperature distribution within the channel. The channel consists of a hot lower plate and a cold upper plate, with the nanofluid flowing steadily between them. This configuration allows us to investigate the heat transfer behaviors of the nanofluid in the presence of various forces. By considering the impact of various factors on temperature distribution, we can enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of heat transfer in nanofluids. Figure 1 Geometry of a semi-porous channel. Full size image The study presented the continuity equation and Navier–Stokes to evaluate the system's heat transfer 32 . $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0$$ (1) $${\rho }_{\mathrm{nf}}\left(u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)=-\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}+{\mu }_{nf}\left(\frac{{\partial }^{2}u}{\partial {y}^{2}}\right)-{\sigma }_{nf}{B}_{0}{ }^{2}u$$ (2) $${\rho }_{nf}\left(u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\right)=-\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}+{\mu }_{nf}\left(\frac{{\partial }^{2}v}{\partial {x}^{2}}\right)$$ (3) $${\left(\rho {C}_{p}\right)}_{nf}\left(u\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\right)={k}_{nf}\left(\frac{{\partial }^{2}T}{\partial {y}^{2}}\right)+{\sigma }_{nf}{B}_{0}{ }^{2}{u}^{2}-\frac{\partial {q}_{r}}{\partial y},$$ (4) The text explains the consideration of radiation heat flux in the form of the Rosseland approximation, where the Stefan-Boltzmann constant \({(\sigma }_{e})\) and the mean absorption coefficient \({(\beta }_{R})\) play a key role. Specifically, the radiation heat flux ( \({q}_{r}\) ) is given by the expression \({q}_{r}=-\frac{4{\sigma }_{e}}{3{\beta }_{R}}\frac{\partial {T}^{4}}{\partial y}\) 33 . For this study, it is assumed that the differences in fluid-phase temperatures within the flow are small enough for \({(T}^{4})\) to be expressed as a linear function of temperature. This is achieved through the expansion of \(({T}^{4})\) in a Taylor series around the temperature \({(T}_{C})\) , with higher-order terms being neglected. The resulting expression is \({T}^{4}\cong 4{T}_{c}^{3}T-3{T}_{c}^{4}\) . In other words, the study accounts for radiation heat flux within the flow by utilizing the Rosseland approximation. This involves considering the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and the mean absorption coefficient in calculating the radiation heat flux. Additionally, the Taylor series expansion is used to simplify the expression of \(({T}^{4})\) and account for small differences in fluid-phase temperatures within the flow. By applying these methods, the study aims to provide a more accurate understanding of heat transfer behavior within the system. The effective properties of the nanofluid play a crucial role in the study of its behavior within the flow. Specifically, we are interested in the effective density, effective heat capacity, and electrical conductivity of the nanofluid, which are defined as follows 32 : $${\rho }_{nf}=(1-\varphi ){\rho }_{f}+\varphi {\rho }_{p}$$ (5) $${\left(\rho {C}_{p}\right)}_{nf}=(1-\varphi ){\left(\rho {C}_{p}\right)}_{f}+\varphi {\left(\rho {C}_{p}\right)}_{p}$$ (6) $$\frac{{\sigma }_{nf}}{{\sigma }_{f}}=1+\frac{3\left(\frac{{\sigma }_{p}}{{\sigma }_{f}}-1\right)\varphi }{\left(\frac{{\sigma }_{p}}{{\sigma }_{f}}+2\right)-\left(\frac{{\sigma }_{p}}{{\sigma }_{f}}-1\right)\varphi }$$ (7) The effective density is the ratio of the mass flow rate to the volumetric flow rate of the nanofluid. It considers the presence of the nanoparticles and their effect on the overall density of the fluid. The effective heat capacity represents the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of the nanofluid by a certain amount. It accounts for both the base fluid's heat capacity and the nanoparticles' contributions. The electrical conductivity of the nanofluid represents its ability to conduct electrical current. It is affected by various factors, including the concentration and size of the nanoparticles, as well as the properties of the base fluid. By defining these effective properties, we can better understand the behavior of the nanofluid within the flow and how it responds to different forces such as magnetic fields, radiation, and Joule heating. This, in turn, can lead to more accurate modeling and prediction of heat transfer characteristics in a wide range of applications. Also, the KKL (Koo-Kleinstreuer-Li) correlation has been employed to determine the viscosity of the nanofluid in this study 3 , 34 . The KKL correlation is a commonly utilized method for estimating the viscosity of nanofluids. It is based on the theory that the viscosity of a nanofluid is dependent on various factors, such as the size and shape of the nanoparticles that make up the fluid. The correlation considers these factors and provides an estimation of the fluid's viscosity, which is a crucial parameter in determining the flow characteristics in the system. By employing the KKL correlation method, this study aims to determine the viscosity of the nanofluid under investigation more accurately. This, in turn, will lead to a better understanding of the flow properties of the fluid and the heat transfer characteristics of the system as a whole 34 : $$\begin{array}{cc}{\mu }_{eff}& ={\mu }_{\text{static }}+{\mu }_{\text{Brownian }}={\mu }_{\text{static }}+\frac{{k}_{\text{Brownian }}}{{k}_{f}}\times \frac{{\mu }_{f}}{{\mathrm{Pr}}_{f}}\\ {k}_{\text{Brownian }}& =5\times {10}^{4}\varphi {\rho }_{f}{c}_{p,f}\sqrt{\frac{{\kappa }_{b}T}{{\rho }_{p}{d}_{p}}}{g}^{{{\prime}}}\left(T,\varphi ,{d}_{p}\right)\\ {g}^{\mathrm{^{\prime}}}\left(T,\varphi ,{d}_{p}\right)& =\left({a}_{1}+{a}_{2}\mathrm{ln}\left({d}_{p}\right)+{a}_{3}\mathrm{ln}(\varphi )+{a}_{4}\mathrm{ln}(\varphi )\mathrm{ln}\left({d}_{p}\right)+{a}_{5}\mathrm{ln}{\left({d}_{p}\right)}^{2}\right)\mathrm{ln}(T)\\ & +\left({a}_{6}+{a}_{7}\mathrm{ln}\left({d}_{p}\right)+{a}_{8}\mathrm{ln}(\varphi )+{a}_{9}\mathrm{ln}(\varphi )\mathrm{ln}\left({d}_{p}\right)+{a}_{10}\mathrm{ln}{\left({d}_{p}\right)}^{2}\right).\end{array}$$ (8) The related coefficient and properties of Cuo-water nanofluid are presented in Table 1 . Maxwell model and HamiltonCrosser model for irregular particle geometries by introducing a shape factor can be expressed as 35 , 36 : Table 1 Thermo physical properties 32 . Full size table $$\frac{{k}_{nf}}{{k}_{f}}=\frac{{k}_{p}+(m+1){k}_{f}-(m+1)\varphi \left({k}_{f}-{k}_{p}\right)}{{k}_{p}+(m+1){k}_{f}+\varphi \left({k}_{f}-{k}_{p}\right)}$$ (9) The given equation employs \({k}_{p}\) and \({k}_{f}\) to respectively represent the conductivities of the particle material and the base fluid. The shape factor is denoted by " \(m\) " in the equation. Ref. 32 presents distinct values of shape factors (3, 3.7, 4.8, and 5.7) for different shapes of nanoparticles (Spherical, Brick, Cylinder, and Platelet), respectively. This article discusses the use of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO) as a material in the coating of boats, as well as their implementation as a base fluid in nanofluids. The study specifically focuses on the effects of water as a base fluid with CuO nanoparticles on the value of the Nusselt number. Through the research conducted, it was found that CuO nanoparticles are effective in preventing the growth of E. coli bacteria in suspension in low concentrations. CuO nanoparticles also possess magnetic properties, making them suitable for use in ferrofluids. Implementing CuO nanoparticles in various applications highlights their potential as a versatile material capable of being used in different settings and fields. In the following, we consider B.C.s as: $$\begin{array}{cc}& u=bx,v=-{v}_{0},T={T}_{1} \text{ at }y=-a\\ & u=0,v=0,T={T}_{2} \text{ at }y=+a\end{array}$$ (10) the value of \(b\) is less than zero for a channel with shrinking walls and greater than zero for a channel with stretching walls. The method of similarity transformation has been used to obtain ODEs. In addition, non-dimensional parameters are introduced to help with the analysis 32 . $$\eta =\frac{y}{a},u=bx{f}^{{{\prime}}}(\eta ),v=-abf(\eta ),\theta =\frac{T-{T}_{1}}{{T}_{1}-{T}_{2}}$$ (11) The final Eqs. ( 12 – 13 ) can be obtained using the earlier transformation in Eq. ( 11 ). $${f}^{iv}-H{a}^{2}\frac{{A}_{5}}{{A}_{2}}{f}^{{{\prime \prime}}}-R\frac{{A}_{1}}{{A}_{2}}\left({f}^{{{\prime}}}{f}^{{{\prime \prime}}}-f{f}^{{{\prime \prime \prime}}}\right)=0$$ (12) $$\left(1+\frac{4}{3{A}_{4}}Rd\right){\theta }^{{{\prime \prime}}}+\mathrm{Pr}\frac{{A}_{3}}{{A}_{4}}f{\theta }^{{{\prime}}}+H{a}^{2}Ec\frac{\mathrm{Pr}}{R}\frac{{A}_{5}}{{A}_{4}}{f}^{{{\prime}}2}=0,$$ (13) Equations ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) contain various parameters represented by different symbols, such as \(R\) for Reynolds number, \(Ec\) for Eckert number, \(Ha\) for Hartmann number, \(Rd\) for radiation parameter, and \(Pr\) for Prandtl number. The specified values for \(A1- A5\) are also included in the equations 32 . $$\begin{array}{cc}R& =\frac{{a}^{2}b}{{U}_{f}}, Ha={B}_{0}a\sqrt{\frac{{\sigma }_{f}}{{\mu }_{f}}}, Rd=4{\sigma }_{e}{T}_{c}^{3}/\left({\beta }_{R}{k}_{f}\right),\\ Ec& =\frac{{\rho }_{f}(bx{)}^{2}}{{\left(\rho {C}_{p}\right)}_{f}\Delta T},\mathrm{ Pr}=\frac{{a}^{2}b{\left(\rho {C}_{p}\right)}_{f}}{{k}_{f}},\\ {A}_{1}& =\frac{{\rho }_{nf}}{{\rho }_{f}}, {A}_{2}=\frac{{\mu }_{nf}}{{\mu }_{f}},{ A}_{3}=\frac{{\left(\rho {C}_{p}\right)}_{nf}}{{\left(\rho {C}_{p}\right)}_{f}},{ A}_{4}=\frac{{k}_{nf}}{{k}_{f}},{ A}_{5}=\frac{{\sigma }_{nf}}{{\sigma }_{f}}.\end{array}$$ (14) Also, the B.C.s of ODEs are as follows: $$\begin{array}{cc}& {f}^{{{\prime}}}(-1)=1,{f}^{{{\prime}}}(1)=0,\theta (-1)=1,\\ & f(-1)=\lambda =\frac{{v}_{0}}{ab},f(1)=0,\theta (1)=0.\end{array}$$ (15) Methodology This study utilizes both Akbari-Ganji's and Homotopy perturbation methods to solve a specific problem. These applied techniques provide accurate solutions and offer several advantages over conventional methods. For instance, Akbari-Ganji's method is highly effective in transforming nonlinear problems into linear ones. This process enables well-established linear analytic techniques, simplifying the computation process. On the other hand, the Homotopy Perturbation Method is a powerful tool for solving problems with complex nonlinearities. It provides an iterative series solution that converges rapidly to the exact solution. The basic idea of HPM We assume Eq. ( 16 ) as a base function and Eq. ( 17 ) as BC 37 : $$A\left(u\right)-f\left(r\right)=0$$ (16) $$B\left(u,\frac{\partial u}{\partial n}\right)=0$$ (17) And \(A(u)\) is described: $$A\left(u\right)=L\left(u\right)+N\left(u\right)$$ (18) HPM principle is written $$H\left(\nu ,P\right)=\left(1-P\right)\left[L\left(\nu \right)-L\left({u}_{0}\right)\right]+P\left[N\left(v\right)-f\left(r\right)\right]=0$$ (19) Or $$H\left(v,P\right)=L\left(v\right)-L\left({u}_{0}\right)+PL\left({u}_{0}\right)+p\left[N\left(v\right)-f\left(r\right)\right]=0$$ (20) where $$v\left(r,P\right):\Omega \times \left[\mathrm{0,1}\right]\to R$$ (21) After following Eqs. ( 19 ) and ( 20 ): $$H\left(v,0\right)=L\left(v\right)-L\left({u}_{0}\right)=0, \,\,\,\,\,H\left(v,1\right)=A\left(v\right)-f\left(r\right)=0$$ (22) The parameter \(P\) , which belongs to the interval \([\mathrm{0,1}]\) , is an embedding parameter, \({u}_{0}\) represents initial approximation that fulfills the B.C. A change in parameter \(P\) from 0 to 1 causes the transformation of \(v(r,p)\) from u 0 to \({u}_{r}\) . In this context, \(v\) is considered a function. $$v={v}_{0}+p\times {v}_{1}+{P}^{2}\times {v}_{2}+\dots$$ (23) And the best approximation is $$u=\underset{P\to 1}{lim}v={v}_{0}+{v}_{1}+{v}_{2}$$ (24) The basic idea of AGM To implement analytical methods for both linear and nonlinear differential equations, B.C.s and I.C.s are necessary. Confirming the differential equations in the following form is commonplace 38 : $${p}_{k}:f\left(u,{u}^{{{\prime}}},{u}^{{{\prime \prime}}},\dots ,{u}^{(n)}\right)=0, u=u(x)$$ (25) So, the order ( \(n\) ) and nonlinearity of the differential equation \(\left({\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{k}}\right)\) can be determined, along with the form of boundary conditions, which take the following shape: $$\begin{array}{c}u(0)={u}_{0},{u}^{{{\prime}}}(0)={u}_{1},\dots ,{u}^{(m-1)}(0)={u}_{m-1}\\ u(L)={u}_{{L}_{0}},{u}^{{{\prime}}}(L)={u}_{{L}_{1}},\dots ,{u}^{(m-1)}(L)={u}_{{L}_{m-1}}\end{array}$$ (26) The subsequent stage in the solution of the problem using AGM is to utilize polynomials that have constant coefficients, like the following: $$f\left(\eta \right)=\sum_{k=0}^{n} {a}_{k}{e}^{-0.8k\eta }={a}_{0}+{a}_{1}{e}^{-0.8\eta }+{a}_{2}{e}^{-1.6\eta }+{a}_{3}{e}^{-2.4\eta }+{a}_{4}{e}^{-3.2\eta }+{a}_{5}{e}^{-4\eta }+{a}_{6}{e}^{-4.8\eta }+{a}_{7}{e}^{-5.6\eta }$$ (27) $$g(\eta )=\sum_{k=0}^{n} {b}_{k}{e}^{-0.8k\eta }={b}_{0}+{b}_{1}{e}^{-0.8\eta }+{b}_{2}{e}^{-1.6\eta }+{b}_{3}{e}^{-2.4\eta }+{b}_{4}{e}^{-3.2\eta }+{b}_{5}{e}^{-4\eta }+{b}_{6}{e}^{-4.8\eta }$$ (28) So when \(\eta =0\) : $$\begin{array}{cc}& u(0)={a}_{0}={u}_{0}\\ & {u}^{{{\prime}}}(0)={a}_{1}={u}_{1}\\ & {u}^{{{\prime \prime}}}(0)={a}_{2}={u}_{2}\end{array}$$ (29) And \(\eta =L\) : $$\begin{array}{cc}& u(L)={a}_{0}+{a}_{1}L+{a}_{2}{L}^{2}+\dots +{a}_{n}{L}^{n}={u}_{{L}_{0}}\\ & {u}^{{{\prime}}}(L)={a}_{1}+2{a}_{2}L+3{a}_{3}{L}^{2}+\dots +n{a}_{n}{L}^{n-1}={u}_{{L}_{1}}\\ & {u}^{{{\prime \prime}}}(L)=2{a}_{2}+6{a}_{3}L+12{a}_{4}{L}^{2}+\dots +n(n-1){a}_{n}{L}^{n-2}={u}_{{L}_{n-1}}\end{array}$$ (30) Results and discussion The research focused on analyzing the effect of thermal radiation on the flow and heat transfer of a Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) CuO-water nanofluid in a semi-porous channel with a stretching wall. The energy equation takes into account the influences of Joule heating. ODEs were obtained through a similarity transformation and were solved using AGM and HPM methods. Verifying the presented results with those of the previous work showed good accuracy, as depicted in Fig. 2 and Tables 2 and 3 .

The comparison is conducted for various parameter values. By providing a numerical comparison, we can demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods and their ability to produce accurate results compared to other established methods. Table 3 compares the skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt number obtained from this study for different values of nanoparticle volume fraction when \(Pr = 6.2\) , with the results presented in Refs. 40 , 41 . The comparison demonstrates that the results obtained from this study are consistent with previous research studies, reinforcing our findings' validity. In addition, Table 4 shows the influence of nanoparticle shape on the local Nusselt number for various types of nanoparticles when \(Pr = 6.2\) . Through the analysis, it was found that platelet-shaped nanoparticles provide the maximum Nusselt number. Therefore, we have selected Platelet nanoparticles for further investigation, and this information will be useful in designing more efficient heat transfer systems. The results presented in Tables 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 provide valuable insights into the thermal conductivity of fluids and the utilization of nanoparticles as enhancers for heat transfer. Table 4 Nusselt number for various shapes of the nanoparticles when \(Pr = 6.2\) . Full size table In Fig. 3 , the impact of Reynolds number on the velocity and temperature profiles is shown when \(Rd = 0.5, Ha = 1, Ec = 0.5, \lambda = 1, \varphi = 0.04,\) and \(Pr = 6.2\) . The observed decrease in the temperature profiles and the vertical velocity with an increase in Reynolds number can be attributed to increased fluid turbulence and mixing, causing a reduction in heat transfer efficiency. The decrease in the horizontal velocity near the down wall can be explained by the presence of the solid boundary, which causes a damping effect on the fluid motion. On the other hand, the opposite trend observed in the proximity of the upper wall can be attributed to the orientation of the fluid flow, which is influenced by the buoyancy force imposed by the temperature gradient. Figure 3 Examining differences in temperature and velocity profiles for varying values of \(Re\) by comparing AGM, HPM. Full size image Figure 4 presents the impact of Hartmann number on the temperature and velocity profiles. The observed enhancement in the temperature profile with an increase in the Hartmann number can be attributed to increased heat transfer efficiency due to the applied magnetic field, which suppresses the mixing of the fluid and thus enhances the thermal boundary layer. The reduction in the velocity with increasing conductivity can be explained by the Lorentz force, which acts against the fluid motion and thus reduces the fluid velocity. Figure 4 Examining differences in temperature and velocity profiles for varying values of \(Ha\) by comparing AGM, HPM. Full size image Figure 5 shows the impact of the suction parameter on the temperature and velocity profiles. The increased mixing and turbulence in the fluid flow enhances the temperature profile and the vertical velocity with an increase in the suction parameter can be explained by the increased mixing and turbulence, which enhances the convective heat transfer. The reduction in the horizontal velocity can be attributed to the suction effect, which draws fluid towards the wall and thus reduces the flow velocity in the central region. Additionally, the shift in the min point of velocity to the lower wall can be attributed to the effect of suction on the flow structure, which alters the flow patterns near the wall. These physical justifications provide a deeper understanding of the observed trends and enhance the discussion on the impact of different parameters on fluid flow and heat transfer.

According to these results, temperature increases when velocity increases in different values of \(\gamma\) . The results presented here can serve as a basis for further research and development, particularly in understanding the effects of individual parameters on the behavior of these models. These findings offer valuable insights into the behavior of complex systems of differential equations and provide a strong foundation for future research in related areas.

Full size image Conclusion After conducting a detailed study on the flow and heat transfer of Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) CuO-water nanofluid in a semi-porous channel with a stretching wall, we can conclude that the proposed methods (AGM and HPM) are highly effective and accurate in predicting the behavior of fluids. The analyses demonstrated interesting results on the influence of several factors, such as nanofluid volume fraction, Hartmann number, nanoparticle shape, Eckert number, suction parameter, and radiation parameter, on the temperature and velocity profiles. Specifically, we found that the temperature profile decreased with increasing nanofluid volume fraction, while Platelet-shaped nanoparticles provided the highest Nusselt number. Additionally, we observed that the applied magnetic field and suction parameter were the key drivers for enhancing the heat transfer efficiency of the fluid. Furthermore, the presented comparison with previous work and numerical methods reinforces the validity of the results. In summary, the research findings highlight the importance of investigating different parameters and physical processes in accurately predicting the behavior of fluids. In future investigations, we recommend further exploration into the impact of particle size, fluid flow rates, and other numerical methods. Additionally, exploring the effect of other physical phenomena, such as chemical reactions or phase changes, on flow and heat transfer can provide deeper insights into the thermal conductivity of fluids. By continuing to analyze the behavior of fluids, we can develop better heat transfer and flow systems for various industrial and technological applications.
